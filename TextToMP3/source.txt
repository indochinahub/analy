0001	Chapter 1: Basic concepts of marketing.
0002	Simply put, marketing is managing profitable relationships, by attracting new customers by superior value and keeping current customers by delivering satisfaction.
0003	Marketing must be understood in the sense of satisfying customer needs.
0004	Marketing can be defined as the process by which companies create value for customers and build strong customer relationships to capture value from customers in return.
0005	A five:step model of the marketing process will provide the structure of this chapter.
0006	Understanding the marketplace and customer needs.
0007	There are five different core customer and marketplace concepts.
0008	Customer needs, wants and demands.
0009	Human needs are states of felt deprivation and can include physical, social and individual needs.
0010	Wants are the form human needs take as they are shaped by culture and individual personality.
0011	Demands are human wants that are backed by buying power.
0012	Market offerings are a combinations of products, services and experiences offered to a market to satisfy a need or want.
0013	These can be physical products, but also services – activities that are essentially intangible.
0014	The phenomenon of marketing myopia is paying more attention to company products, than to the underlying needs of consumers.
0015	Value and satisfaction are key building blocks for customer relationships.
0016	Exchanges are the acts of obtaining a desired object form someone by offering something in return.
0017	Marketing consists of actions trying to build an exchange relationship with an audience.
0018	A market is the set of all actual and potential buyers of a product or service.
0019	Marketing involves serving a market of final consumers in the face of competitors.
0020	Designing a customer:driven marketing strategy.
0021	Marketing management is the art and science of choosing target markets and building profitable relationships with them.
0022	The aim is to find, attract, keep and grow the targeted customers by creating and delivering superior customer value.
0023	The target audience can be selected by dividing the market into customer segments (market segmentation) and selecting which segments to go after (target marketing).
0024	A company must also decide how to serve the targeted audience, by offering a value proposition.
0025	A value proposition is the set of benefits or values a company promises to deliver --- There are five alternative concepts that companies use to carry out their marketing strategy.
0026	The production concept: the idea that consumers will favour products that are available and highly affordable and that the organisation should therefore focus on improving production and distribution efficiency.
0027	The product concept: the idea that consumers will favour products that offer the most quality, performance, and features and that the organisation should therefore devote its energy to making continuous product improvements.
0028	The selling concept: the idea that consumers will not buy enough of the firm’s product, unless it undertakes a large:scale selling and promotion effort.
0029	The marketing concept: the idea that achieving organisational goals depends on knowing the needs and wants of target markets and delivering the desired satisfactions better than competitors do.
0030	It can be regarded as an “outside:in view”.
0031	The societal marketing concept is the idea that a company’s marketing decisions should consider consumer wants, the company’s requirements, consumers’ long:term interests and society’s long:term interests.
0032	Companies should deliver value in a way that maintains consumers and society’s well:being.
0033	Constructing an integrated marketing plan.
0034	A marketing strategy outlines which customers it will serve and how it will create value.
0035	The marketer develops an integrated marketing plan that will deliver value to customers.
0036	It contains the marketing mix: the tools used to implement the strategy, which are the four Ps: product, price, place and promotion.
0037	--- Building customer relationships.
0038	The first three steps all lead to this one: building profitable customer relationships.
0039	Customer relationship management (CRM) is the overall process of building and maintaining profitable customer relationships by delivering superior customer value and satisfaction.
0040	The crucial part here is to create superior customer:perceived:value, which is the customer’s evaluation of the difference between all the benefits and all the costs of a marketing offer, in relation to those of competing offers and superior customer satisfaction, which is the extent to which a product’s perceived performance matches a buyer’s expectations.
0041	Customer delight can be achieved by delivering more than promised.
0042	Customer relationships exist at multiple levels.
0043	They can be basic relationships or full partnerships and everything in between.
0044	In current times, companies are choosing their customers more selectively.
0045	New technologies have paved the way for two:way customer relationships, where consumers have more power and control.
0046	The marketing world is also embracing customer:managed relationships: marketing relationships in which customers, empowered by today’s new digital technologies, interact with companies and with each other to shape their relationships with brands.
0047	A growing part of this dialogue is consumer:generated marketing: brand exchanges created by consumers themselves, by which consumers are playing an increasing role in shaping their own brand experiences and those of other consumers.
0048	Today’s marketers often work with a variety of partners to build consumer relationships.
0049	Partner relationship management means working closely with partners in other company departments and outside the company to jointly bring greater value to customers.
0050	These partners can be inside the company, but also outside the firm.
0051	The supply chain is a channel, from raw material to final product, and the companies involved can be partners through supply chain management.
0052	--- Capturing customer value.
0053	The final step of the model involves capturing value.
0054	Customer lifetime value is the value of the entire stream of purchases that the customer would make over a lifetime of patronage.
0055	Companies must aim high in building customer relations, to make sure that customers are coming back.
0056	Good CRM can help increase the share of customer, the portion of the customer’s purchasing that a company gets in its product categories.
0057	Customer equity is the total combined customer lifetime values of all of the company’s customers.
0058	It is the future value of the company’s customer base.
0059	When building relationships, it is important to build the right relationships with the right customers.
0060	Customers can be high: or low:profitable and short:term or long:term oriented.
0061	When putting these on two axes, a matrix of four terms appears.
0062	Butterflies are profitable, but not loyal and have a high profit potential.
0063	True friends are both profitable and loyal and the firm should invest in a continuous relationship.
0064	Barnacles are loyal, but unprofitable.
0065	If they can’t be improved, the company should try to get rid of them.
0066	Strangers are not loyal and unprofitable, the company should not invest in them.
0067	--- Today’s world is moving and changing fast.
0068	The economic crisis resulted in an uncertain economic environment, where consumers are more careful when spending their money.
0069	The technology boom of the digital age leads to an increase in connectedness and information.
0070	It provides marketers with new ways to track customers and create products based on their needs.
0071	It brought a new way of communicating and advertising.
0072	The most dramatic change in technology is the Internet, a vast public web of computer networks that connects users of all types all around the world to each other and an amazingly large information repository.
0073	Web 1 0 connects people with information, Web 2 0 connected people with people and the upcoming Web 3 0 puts information and people connections together into a more usable Internet experience.
0074	Because of globalisation, companies are now globally connected with their customers.
0075	Current times also involve more sustainable marketing practices, involving corporate ethics and social responsibility.
0076	--- Chapter 2: Strategic marketing partners.
0077	Strategic planning is the process of developing and maintaining a strategic fit between the organisation’s goals and capabilities and its changing marketing opportunities.
0078	It is the base for the long term planning of the firm.
0079	At a corporate level, the firm starts defining the company’s mission.
0080	A mission statement is a statement of the organisation’s purpose.
0081	The mission leads to a hierarchy of goals.
0082	Based on this, the management must plan the business portfolio: the collection of businesses and products that make up the company.
0083	Portfolio analysis is the process by which management evaluates the products and businesses that make up the company.
0084	The first step is identifying the strategic business units (SBU) that are vital to the company.
0085	The well:known model of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) sorts the SBUs into a growth:share matrix, leading to four types of SBUs:.
0086	Stars: high growth and high share units, in need of investment.
0087	Cash cows: low:growth, high share units, producing cash.
0088	Question marks: low:share units, in high:growth markets.
0089	Require cash, but can turn out to be unprofitable.
0090	Dogs: low:growth, low:share units, which are not very profitable.
0091	After the units are classified, the company should determine in which units to build share, hold share, harvest the profits or divest the SBU.
0092	Designing the business portfolio also means looking at future businesses.
0093	The product/market expansion grid is a portfolio:planning tool for identifying company growth opportunities through:.
0094	Market penetration: company growth by increasing sales of current products to current market segments without changing the product.
0095	Market development: company growth by identifying and developing new market segments for current company products.
0096	Product development: company growth by offering modified or new products to current market segments.
0097	Diversification: company growth through starting up or acquiring businesses outside the company’s current products and markets.
0098	Companies also need strategies for downsizing, which means reducing the business portfolio by eliminating products or business units that are not profitable or that no longer fit the company’s overall strategy.
0099	Marketing provides a philosophy, input and strategies for the strategic business units.
0100	Besides customer relationship management, marketers must also invest in partner relationship management to form an effective value chain: the series of internal departments that carry out value:creating activities to design, produce, market, deliver and support a firm’s products.
0101	When trying to create customer value, a firm must go beyond the internal value chain and partner up with others in the value delivery network.
0102	The value delivery network is the network composed of the company, its suppliers, its distributors and ultimately its customers who partner with each other to improve the performance of the entire system.
0103	Marketing strategy.
0104	Marketing strategy is the marketing logic by which the company hopes to create customer value and achieve profitable customer relationships.
0105	The company must choose which customers to serve and how to serve them.
0106	This process involves four steps:.
0107	Market segmentation: dividing a market into distinct groups of buyers who have different, needs, characteristics or behaviour and who might require separate products or marketing programmes.
0108	A market segment is a group of consumers who respond in a similar way to a given set of marketing efforts.
0109	Market targeting is the process of evaluating each market segment’s attractiveness and selecting one or more segments to enter.
0110	Positioning is arranging for a product to occupy a clear, distinctive and desirable place relative to competing products in the minds of consumers.
0111	Differentiation is actually differentiating the market offering to create superior :customer value.
0112	The marketing mix is the set of tactical marketing tools: product, price, place and promotion, that the firm blends to produce the response it wants in the target market.
0113	Product refers to the combination of goods and service the firm offers.
0114	Price is the amount the customer pays to obtain the product.
0115	Place refers to the availability of the product.
0116	Promotion relates to the activities that communicate the benefits of the product.
0117	Managing the marketing process requires four marketing management functions.
0118	The first is marketing analysis, starting with a SWOT analysis.
0119	A SWOT analysis is an overall evaluation of the company’s strengths (S – internal capabilities), weaknesses (W – internal limitations), opportunities (O – external factors that can be profitable) and threats (T – external factors that might challenge the company).
0120	Secondly, marketing planning involves choosing the right marketing strategies.
0121	Third is marketing implementation: turning marketing strategies and plans into marketing actions to accomplish strategic marketing objectives.
0122	And finally, there is marketing control: measuring and evaluating the results of marketing strategies and plans and taking corrective action to ensure that the objectives are achieved.
0123	Operating control refers to checking the performance against the annual plan, while strategic control involves looking at the match between strategies and opportunities.
0124	Nowadays, marketers need to back up their spending by measurable results.
0125	The return on marketing investment (marketing ROI) is the net return from a marketing investment divided by the costs of the marketing investment.
0126	The marketing ROI measures the profits generated by investments in marketing activities and can be a helpful tool, but is also difficult to measure.
0127	Chapter 3: The marketing environment.
0128	The marketing environment consists of the actors and forces outside marketing that affect marketing management’s ability to build and maintain successful relationships with target customers.
0129	It consists both of the micro and macro environment.
0130	The microenvironment.
0131	The microenvironment consists of the actors close to the company that affect its ability to serve its customers, such as: the company itself and its subdivisions and suppliers that provide the resources the firm needs to produce its products.
0132	But also of marketing intermediaries, which are firms that help the company to promote, sell and distribute its goods to final buyers.
0133	Resellers are distribution channel firms.
0134	Physical distribution firms help the company stock goods, while marketing service agencies are marketing research firms.
0135	Financial intermediaries include banks and credit companies.
0136	Other factors are competitors that operate in the same markets as the firm and the public: any group that has an actual or potential interest in or impact on an organisation’s ability to achieve its objectives.
0137	These can be financial publics, media publics, government publics, local publics, general public and internal publics.
0138	Finally, customers are the most important actors.
0139	Consumers markets consist of individuals that buy goods for personal consumption.
0140	Business markets buy goods for usage in production processes, while reseller markets buy to resell at a profit.
0141	Government markets consist of buyers who use the product for public service, and international markets consist of all these types of markets across the border --- The macroenvironment.
0142	The macroenvironment consists of the larger societal forces that affect the microenvironment and consists of multiple factors.
0143	Demography: the study of human populations in terms of size, density, location, age, gender, face, occupational and other statistics.
0144	Changes in demographics result in changes in markets.
0145	There are some important demographic trends in today’s world, such as the world population growth and the changing age structure of the world population, where some parts of the world are aging and others have younger populations.
0146	In the developed world, there are often generational differences to be found.
0147	Baby boomers are the 78 million people born during the years following the Second World War and lasting until 1964  Generation X are the 45 million people born between 1965 and 1976 in the “birth death” following the baby boom.
0148	Generation Y or the Millennials are the 83 million children of the baby boomers born between 1977 and 2000.
0149	They are characterized by a high comfort in technology.
0150	Changes can also be found in the family structure.
0151	The traditional western household (husband, wife and children) is no longer typical.
0152	People marry later and divorce more.
0153	There is an increased number of working women and youngsters tend to stay at home longer  The workforce is also aging, because people need to work beyond the previous retirement age.
0154	There are also geographic shifts, such as migration.
0155	These movements in population lead to opportunities for marketing niche products and services.
0156	There are also migration movements within countries, namely from the rural to urban areas, also called urbanisation.
0157	The economic environment consists of economic factors that affect consumer purchasing power and spending patterns.
0158	Countries vary in characteristics, some can be considered industrial economies, while others can be subsistence economies, consuming most of their own output.
0159	In between are developing economies that offer marketing opportunities.
0160	The BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) countries are a leading group of fast expanding nations.
0161	There are also changes in customer spending patterns, such as the recent recessions, which can lead to lifestyle changes.
0162	Marketers should also pay attention to income distribution and income levels.
0163	The natural environment involves natural resources that are needed as inputs by marketers or that are affected by marketing activities.
0164	Changes in this environment involve an increase in shortage of raw materials, increased pollution and increased governmental intervention.
0165	Environmental sustainability involves developing strategies and practices that create a world economy that the planet can support indefinitely.
0166	The technological environment consists of forces that create new technologies, creating new product and market opportunities.
0167	It can provide great opportunities, but also comes with certain dangers.
0168	The political environment consists of laws, government agencies and pressure groups that influence and limit various organisation and individuals in a given society.
0169	Current trends in our world today are increasing legislation affecting businesses globally and thus an increase in governmental influence over businesses.
0170	There is also an increase in emphasis on ethics and operating socially responsible.
0171	Cause:related marketing refers to companies linking themselves to meaningful causes, to improve company image.
0172	The cultural environment involves instructions and other forces that affect society’s basic values, perceptions, preference and behaviour  Cultural factors influence how people think and consume.
0173	Core beliefs are fundamental and passed on by parents and reinforced by the environment.
0174	Secondary beliefs are more open to change.
0175	People can vary in their views of themselves, of others, of organisation, but also in their views of society, nature and the universe.
0176	In conclusion, firms should be pro:active rather than observing in respect to the marketing environment.
0177	Chapter 4: Customer insights.
0178	Marketing relies on good customer information.
0179	Customer insights are fresh understanding of customers and the marketplace derived from marketing information that become the basis for creating customer value and relationships.
0180	To gain this information, companies must design marketing information systems (MIS), which are people and procedures for assessing information needs, developing the needed information and helping decision makers to use the information to generate and validate actionable customer and market insights.
0181	A MIS helps to assess information needs, develop needed information and analyse the right information to form customer insights.
0182	Internal databases are electronic collections of consumer and market information obtained from data sources within the company network.
0183	Internal data can be a strong base for a competitive advantage, because of the potential of this information.
0184	Competitive marketing intelligence is the systematic collection and analysis of publicly available information about consumers, competitors and developments in the marketing environment.
0185	Good marketing intelligence helps gain insights in how consumers think of and connect with the brand.
0186	Marketing research.
0187	Marketing research is the systematic design, collection, analysis and reporting of data relevant to a specific marketing situation facing an organisation.
0188	The process of marketing research has four steps:.
0189	Defining the problem and research objectives.
0190	The objective of exploratory research is to gather preliminary information that will help define problems and suggest hypotheses.
0191	The objective of descriptive research is to better describe marketing problems, situations or markets.
0192	Causal research aims to test hypotheses about cause:and:effect relationships.
0193	Developing the research plan on how the information will be gathered.
0194	Secondary data is information that already exists somewhere, having been collected for another purpose.
0195	Secondary data can be accessed by using commercial online databases, which are collections of information available from online commercial sources or accessible via the Internet.
0196	Internet search engines can be used to locate secondary data, but the research must verify that the found information is relevant, accurate, current and impartial.
0197	Primary data is information collected for the specific purpose at hand.
0198	It can be collected via observational research, which gathers primary data by observing relevant people, actions and situations.
0199	Ethnographic research is a form of observational research that involves sending trained observers to watch and interact with consumers in their “natural environments”.
0200	Primary data can also be collected via survey research, which gathers information by asking people questions about their knowledge, attitudes, preferences and buying behaviour  Experimental research gathers primary data by selecting matched groups of subjects, giving them different treatments, controlling related factors and checking for differences in group responses.
0201	Information can be collected via mail, telephone, personal interviews or online.
0202	Mail questionnaires can be quite massive, while telephone information is also quickly gathered.
0203	Personal interviewing can be individual or group interviews.
0204	Online marketing research collects primary data online through Internet surveys, online focus groups, web:based experiments or tracking consumer’s behaviour online.
0205	Online focus groups gather a small group of people online with a trained moderator to chat about a product, service or organisation and gain qualitative insights about consumer attitudes and behaviour.
0206	It is often impossible to collect information from the entire population, so marketers often base conclusions on samples.
0207	A sample is a segment of the population selected for marketing research to represent the population as a whole.
0208	Three decisions regarding the sample need to be made: the sampling unit (who), sampling size (how many) and sampling procedure (how should they be chosen).
0209	There are probability samples, in which each member of the population has an equal chance of being included, such as simple random samples, stratified random samples and cluster samples.
0210	But there are also non:probability samples, such as convenience samples, judgment samples and quota sample categories.
0211	When collecting primary data, there are two research instruments: the questionnaire and mechanical devices.
0212	The questionnaire can be via email, phone or online and are flexible.
0213	Mechanical instruments can help monitor consumer behaviour --- Implementing the research plan means putting it into action.
0214	This means collecting, processing and analysing the information.
0215	Interpreting and reporting the findings.
0216	The interpretation should not only be done by the researchers, but also by the marketing managers who know about the problem and the decisions that need to be made.
0217	--- Customer relationship management (CRM) is managing detailed information about individual customers and carefully managing customer touch points to maximise loyalty.
0218	It means capturing and using consumer data to manage customer interactions and build customer relationships.
0219	Data mining techniques can be used to access customer data.
0220	By using CRM to understand customers, relationships with them can be deeper.
0221	When collecting marketing information, some things must be kept in mind.
0222	When executing international marketing research, cultural differences and struggles in accessibility must be kept in mind.
0223	There are also concerns regarding public policy and ethics in marketing research, such as intrusions on privacy and the misuse of the findings of the research.
0224	Chapter 5: Consumer buyer behaviour  Consumer buyer behaviour is the buying behaviour of final consumers: individuals and households that buy goods and services for personal consumption.
0225	All these consumers add up to the consumer market: all the households and individual that buy or acquire goods and services for personal consumption.
0226	Consumers make buying decisions every day, but it can be difficult to determine why they make certain decisions.
0227	Consumer purchases are influenced by different characteristics.
0228	--- Cultural factors.
0229	Cultural factors have an influence on consumer behaviour  Culture is the set of basic values, perceptions, wants and behaviours learned by a member of society from family and other important institutions.
0230	A subculture is a group of people with shared value systems based on common life experiences and situations.
0231	They are distinct, but not necessarily mutually exclusive.
0232	Social classes are relatively permanent and ordered divisions in a society whose members share similar values, interests and behaviours.
0233	--- Social factors.
0234	Another influence is social factors.
0235	Groups are two or more people who interact to accomplish individual or mutual goals.
0236	Many small groups influence a person’s behaviour  Membership groups are groups in which a person belongs, while reference groups serve as direct points of comparison.
0237	Word:of:mouth influence of friends and other consumers can have a strong influence on buying behaviour  An opinion leader is a person within a reference group who, because of skills, knowledge, personality or other characteristics, exerts social influence on others.
0238	Marketers try to identify the opinion leader and aim their marketing efforts towards this person.
0239	Buzz marketing involves creating opinion leaders to serve as brand ambassadors.
0240	Online social networks are online communities, such as blogs, social networking sites or even virtual worlds, where people socialize or exchange information and opinions.
0241	Family can have a strong influence on buying behaviour as well.
0242	Buying role patterns in families change with evolving consumer lifestyles.
0243	A person belongs to many groups beside the family, also clubs, organisation and online communities.
0244	The position of a person in a group is defined in terms of role and status.
0245	A role consists of the expected actions of a person.
0246	People usually choose products appropriate to their role and status.
0247	--- Personal factors.
0248	Personal characteristics also have an influence on consumer buyer behaviour  These characteristics can be the person’s age and life:cycle stage, the person’s occupation and economic situation, but also lifestyle and personality.
0249	Lifestyle is a person’s pattern of living as expressed in his or her activities, interests and opinions.
0250	Personality is the unique psychological characteristics that distinguish a person or group.
0251	It can be said that brands also have personalities.
0252	A brand personality is the mix of human traits that may be used to describe the brand.
0253	There are five general brand personality traits: sincerity, excitement, competence, sophistication and ruggedness.
0254	--- Psychological factors.
0255	Buying behaviour is influenced by four major psychological factors: motivation, perception, learning and beliefs and attitudes.
0256	Motive (drive) is a need that is sufficiently pressing to direct the person to seek satisfaction of the need.
0257	Motivation research refers to qualitative research designed to find consumer’s hidden motivations.
0258	Maslow’s hierarchy of needs categorizes needs into a pyramid, consisting of psychological needs, safety needs, social needs, esteem needs and self:actualisation needs.
0259	Perception is the process by which people select, organise and interpret information to form a meaningful picture of the world.
0260	People form different perceptions of the same stimulus because of three perceptual processes: selective attention, selective distortion and selective retention.
0261	Learning describes changes in an individual’s behaviour arising from experience.
0262	A drive is a strong stimulus that calls for action.
0263	Cues are minor stimuli that determine how a person responds.
0264	A belief is a descriptive thought that a person holds about something.
0265	An attitude is a person’s consistently favourable or unfavourable evaluations, feelings and tendencies toward an object or idea.
0266	Attitudes can be difficult to change, because they are usually part of bigger pattern.
0267	There are different types of buying decision behaviour  Complex buying behaviour is characterized by high consumer involvement in a purchase and significant perceived differences among brands.
0268	The buyer will pass through a learning process, developing beliefs and attitudes and then a purchase choice will follow.
0269	Dissonance:reducing buying behaviour is consumer buying behaviour characterised by high involvement, but few perceived differences among brands.
0270	Habitual buying behaviour is consumer buying behaviour characterized by low consumer involvement and few significantly perceived differences.
0271	Repetition of advertisements can create brand familiarity (but not conviction), which can lead to habitual purchases.
0272	Variety:seeking buying behaviour is consumer buying behaviour characterised by low consumer involvement, but significant perceived brand differences.
0273	The buyer decision process has five stages.
0274	Need recognition is the first stage, in which the consumer recognises a problem or need.
0275	Information search is the stage in which the consumer is aroused to search for more information, the consumer may simply have heightened attention or may go into active information search.
0276	Information can be obtained from personal sources, commercial sources, public sources and experiential sources.
0277	Evaluation of alternatives.
0278	Alternative evaluation is the process in which the consumer uses information to evaluate alternative brands in the choice set.
0279	Purchase decision is the buyer’s decision about which brand to purchase.
0280	Both the attitude of others and unexpected situational factors can influence the ultimate decision.
0281	Post:purchase behaviour is the stage of the buyer decision process in which consumers take further action after purchase based on their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with a purchase.
0282	Cognitive dissonance is buyer discomfort caused by post:purchase conflict.
0283	--- The buyer decision process can be different for new products.
0284	A new product is a good, service or idea that is perceived by some potential customers as new.
0285	The consumer must decide to adopt them or not.
0286	The adoption process is the mental process through which an individual passes from first hearing about an innovation to final adoption.
0287	There are five stages in the adoption process: awareness, interest, evaluation, trial and adoption.
0288	--- Chapter 6: Business markets.
0289	Business buy behaviour of organisations that buy goods and services for use in the production of other products and services that are sold, rented or supplied to others.
0290	The business buying process is the decision process by which business buyers determine which products and services their organisations need to purchase and then find, evaluate and choose among alternative suppliers and brands.
0291	The business market is bigger than the consumer markets, and differs in many ways.
0292	--- The business markets consist normally with less, but larger buyers than consumer markets.
0293	Business demand is derived demand: business demand ultimately derives from the demand for consumer goods.
0294	Business markets’ demand is more inelastic and is less affected by short:term price changes, while demand also fluctuates more quickly.
0295	--- The nature of the buying unit involves more decision participants and a more professional purchasing effort.
0296	The business buyers’ decisions are often more complex and formalized.
0297	Finally, buyer and seller often work on long:term relationships.
0298	Supplier development is the systematic development of networks of supplier:partners to ensure an appropriate and dependable supply of products and materials for use in making products or reselling them to others.
0299	--- There are three types of business buying situations.
0300	A straight rebuy is a business buying situation in which the buyer routinely reorders something without any modifications.
0301	A modified rebuy is when the buyer wants to modify the product specifications, prices, terms or suppliers.
0302	A new task is a business buying situation in which the buyer purchases a product or service for the first time.
0303	Systems selling (or solutions selling) is buying a packaged solution to a problem from a single seller, thus avoiding all the separate decisions involved in a complex buying situation.
0304	--- There are multiple participants in the business buying process.
0305	The buying centre are all the individuals and units that play a role in the purchase decision:making process.
0306	: Users are members of the buying organisation who will actually use the purchased product or service.
0307	: Influencers are people in an organisation’s buying centre who affect the buying decision, they often help define specifications and also provide information for evaluating alternatives.
0308	: Buyers are the people in an organisation’s buying centre who make an actual purchase.
0309	: Deciders are people who have formal or informal power to select or approve the final suppliers.
0310	: Gatekeepers are people in an organisation’s buyer centre who control the flow of information to others.
0311	The buying centre is a set of buying roles assumed by different people.
0312	--- There are a lot of things that can influence the business buyer, such as environmental factors.
0313	These can include the economic environment, the supply of key materials and culture and customs.
0314	Organisational factors such as objectives, systems and policies can also have an influence.
0315	Also interpersonal factors, such as authority, status and persuasiveness can exercise their influence.
0316	Lastly individual factors, such as age, income, education and risk attitudes can play a role in the decision of the business buyer --- The business buying process.
0317	The business buying process has eight stages.
0318	Problem recognition: someone in the company recognises a problem or need that can be met by acquiring a good or a service.
0319	General need description is the stage in the business buying process in which a buyer describes the general characteristics and quantity of a needed item.
0320	Product specification is the stage in the business buying process in which the buying organisation decides on and specifies the best technical product characteristics for a needed item.
0321	Supplier search is the stage in which the buyer tries to find the best vendors.
0322	Proposal solicitation is the stage in which the buyer invites qualified suppliers to submit proposals.
0323	Supplier selection is the stage in which the buyer reviews proposals and select a supplier or suppliers.
0324	Order:routine specification is the stage in which the buyer writes the final order with the chosen supplier(s), listing the technical specifications, quantity needed, expected time of delivery, return policies and warranties.
0325	Performance review is the stage in which the buyer assesses the performance of the supplier and decided to continue, modify or drop the arrangement.
0326	--- E:procurement involves purchasing through electronic connections between buyers and sellers, usually online.
0327	This can be via reverse auctions, trading exchanges, company buying sites and extranet links.
0328	Benefits of e:procurement are lower transaction costs and efficient purchasing.
0329	--- The institutional market consists of schools, hospitals, nursing homes, prisons and other institutions that provide goods and services to people in their care.
0330	These markets can be extensive and are often characterized by low budgets.
0331	Government markets consist of governmental units (federal, state and local) that purchase or rent goods and services for carrying out the main functions of government.
0332	Chapter 7: Customer:driven strategy.
0333	Today, most companies moved from mass marketing to target marketing: identifying market segments and selecting a few to produce for  There are four major steps in designing a customer:driven marketing strategy.
0334	--- Market segmentation.
0335	Market segmentation means dividing a market into smaller segments with the distinct needs, characteristics or behaviour that might require separate marketing strategies or mixes.
0336	There are different ways to segment a market:.
0337	Geographic segmentation: dividing a market into different geographical units, such as nations, states, regions, counties, cities or even neighbourhoods.
0338	Demographic segmentation: dividing the market into different segments based on variables such as age, gender, family size, family life cycle, income, occupation education, religion, race, generation and nationality.
0339	Age and life:cycle segmentation is dividing a market into different age and life:cycle groups.
0340	Gender segmentation means dividing a market based on gender, while income segmentation divides a market based on income levels.
0341	Psychographic segmentation: dividing a market into different segments based on social class, lifestyle or personality characteristics.
0342	Behavioural segmentation: dividing a market into segments based on consumer knowledge, attitudes, uses or responses to a product.
0343	This can be done via occasion segmentation: dividing the market according to occasions when buyers get the idea to buy, actually making their purchase or use the purchased items.
0344	Benefit segmentation: dividing the market according to the benefits that customers seek from the product.
0345	Markets can also be segmented based on user states, usage rate and loyalty status.
0346	--- Marketers often use multiple segmentation bases to identify a well:defined target group.
0347	For segmentation to be effective, market segments must be measurable, accessible, substantial, differentiable and actionable.
0348	Business markets can be segmented with the same variables, but also with additional ones, such as customer operating characteristics, purchasing approaches and situational factors.
0349	International markets can be segmented using a combination of variables.
0350	Intermarket segmentation (cross:market segmentation): forming segments of consumers who have similar needs and buying behaviour even though they are located in different countries.
0351	--- Market targeting.
0352	Market targeting is the process of evaluating each market segment’s attractiveness and selecting one or more segments to enter  When evaluating segments, a marketer must look at segment size and growth, segment structural attractiveness and company objectives and resources.
0353	A target market consists of a set of buyers sharing common needs or characteristics that the company decides to serve.
0354	There are several forms of market targeting.
0355	: Undifferentiated (mass) marketing: a marketing coverage strategy in which a firm decides to ignore market segment differences and go after the whole market with one offer.
0356	: Differentiated marketing or segmented marketing: a market:coverage strategy in which a firm decides to target several market segments and designs separate offers for each.
0357	: Concentrated marketing (niche): a market:coverage strategy in which a firm goes after a large share of one or a few segments or niches.
0358	--- Micromarketing is tailoring products and marketing programmes to the needs and wants of specific individuals and local customer segments.
0359	It includes local marketing: tailoring brands and promotions to the need and wants of local customer segments:: cities, neighbourhoods and even specific stores.
0360	It also includes individual marketing: tailoring products and marketing programmes to the needs and preferences of individual customers, also called one:to:one marketing, customized marketing and markets:of:one marketing.
0361	--- Companies need to consider a lot of factors when deciding upon a targeting strategy, such as available resources, market variability and competitors’ marketing strategies.
0362	--- Differentiation and positioning.
0363	Differentiation means differentiating the market offering to create superior customer value.
0364	Positioning is arranging for a market offering to occupy a clear, distinctive and desirable place relative to competing products in the mind of target consumers.
0365	A product position is the way the product is defined by consumers on important attributes: the place the product occupies in the consumers’ minds relative to competing products.
0366	Perceptual positioning maps show consumer perceptions of brands versus competing products.
0367	--- To build profitable relationships, marketers must understand customer needs.
0368	When a company is differentiated by superior customer value, this can create a competitive advantage: an advantage over competitors gained by offering greater customer value, either by having lower prices or providing more benefits that justify high prices.
0369	The company can differentiate itself via product differentiation, service differentiation, channel differentiation, people differentiation or image differentiation.
0370	--- When a company has multiple difference to promote, many marketers think the company should focus on one unique selling point (USP), while some others think they can promote more.
0371	Differences worthy to promote need to be important, distinctive, superior, communicable, not easily copied, affordable and profitable.
0372	--- The value proposition is the full positioning of a brand: the full mix of benefits on which it is positioned.
0373	There are multiple possible value propositions, of which five can be “winning”:.
0374	More for more: upscale products and higher prices.
0375	More for the same: used to attack competitors by offering quality at a low price.
0376	The same for less: a good deal.
0377	Less for much less: a less optimal performance for a low price.
0378	More for less: ultimately winning, but difficult to actually achieve.
0379	--- A positioning statement is a statement that summarises company or brand positioning.
0380	It takes this form: To (target segment and needs) our (brand) is (concept) that (point of difference).
0381	Once a position is chosen, a company must take action to deliver and communicate the position to its target customers.
0382	Chapter 8: Building customer value.
0383	A product is anything that can be offered to a market for attention, acquisition, use or consumption that might satisfy a want or need.
0384	A service is an activity, benefit or satisfaction offered for sale that is essentially intangible and does not result in the ownership of anything.
0385	Products are key in the overall market offering.
0386	The market offer might exist of only pure tangible goods, pure services and everything in between.
0387	Product planners need to consider three levels when deciding on services and products.
0388	The first one is the core customer value level.
0389	Secondly, the core benefit must be turned into an actual product.
0390	Finally, an augmented product must be built around the actual product by offering services.
0391	--- Consumer and industrial products.
0392	Products and services fall into two broad classes: consumer products and industrial products.
0393	Consumer products are products bought by   final consumers for personal consumption.
0394	: Convenience products are a type of consumer product that consumers usually buy frequently, immediately and with minimal comparison and buyer effort.
0395	: Shopping products are consumer products that the customer, in the process of selecting and purchasing, usually compares on such attributes as suitability, quality, price and style.
0396	: Speciality products are a type of consumer product with unique characteristics or brand identification for which a significant group of buyers is willing to make a special purchase effort.
0397	: Unsought products are consumer products that the consumer either doesn’t know about, or knows about but does not normally consider buying.
0398	--- Industrial products are products bought by individuals and organisations for further processing or for use in conducting a business.
0399	Materials and parts include raw materials (farm products, natural products) and manufactured parts (component materials and parts).
0400	--- Organisation marketing consists of activities to create, maintain or change the attitudes and the behaviour of target customers.
0401	Corporate image advertising campaigns can be used to improve the image of a firm.
0402	Person marketing consists of activities to change attitudes of specific people.
0403	Place marketing involves activities to create, maintain or change attitudes towards particular places.
0404	Social marketing is the use of commercial marketing concepts and tools in programmes designed to influence individuals’ behaviour to improve their well:being and that of society.
0405	--- Decisions regarding products and services are made at three levels:--- Individual product and service decisions.
0406	Developing a product or service involves defining the benefits.
0407	Product quality are the characteristics of a product or service that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied customer needs.
0408	Total quality management (TQM) is an approach where the whole company is involved in constantly improving the overall quality.
0409	Product quality is based on the quality level and consistency.
0410	Other product and service attributes are product features and the product style (appearance) and the design (heart of the product).
0411	--- A brand is a name, term, sign, symbol, design or a combination of these that identifies the products or services of one sell or group of sellers and differentiates them from those of competitors.
0412	Packaging involves the activities of designing and producing the container or wrapper for a product.
0413	Innovative packaging can give a competitive advantage.
0414	The final product and service decisions include labels that help identifying a product or brand and supporting services of the product.
0415	--- Product line decisions.
0416	A product line is a group of products that are closely related because they function in a similar manner, are sold to the same customer groups, are marketed through the same types of outlets or fall within given price ranges.
0417	Major decisions include the product line length, which can be adjusted by product line filling (adding more items within present range) and line stretching (lengthen beyond current range).
0418	--- Product mix decisions.
0419	A product mix (product portfolio) is the set of all product lines and items that a particular seller offers for sale.
0420	Product mix width is the number of different product lines, while length refers to the total number of items within the product lines.
0421	The product mix depth refers to the number of versions offered for each product in the line.
0422	--- Services marketing.
0423	Firms must decide upon four service characteristics when designing marketing programmes.
0424	Service intangibility: services cannot be seen, tasted, felt, heard or smelled before they are bought.
0425	Service inseparability: service are produced and consumed at the same time and cannot be separated from their providers.
0426	Service variability: the quality of services may greatly vary depending on who provides them and when, where and how.
0427	Service perishability: services cannot be stored for later sale or use.
0428	--- The service profit chain is the chain that links service firm profits with employee and customer satisfaction.
0429	This chain consists of five links: internal service quality, satisfied and productive service employees, greater service value, satisfied and loyal customers and ultimately healthy service profits and growth.
0430	Service marketing is more than traditional external marketing, it also consists of internal and interactive marketing.
0431	Internal marketing involves orienting and motivating customer contact employees and supporting service people to work as a team to provide customer satisfaction.
0432	Interactive marketing involves training services employees in the fine art of interacting with customers to satisfy their needs.
0433	--- Service marketers need to manage service differentiation, making sure that they stand out amongst competitors.
0434	They also need to manage service quality, which can be harder to define than product quality.
0435	Lastly, they need to manage service productivity by ensuring employees are skilful and implementing the powers of technology.
0436	--- Branding.
0437	Brand equity is the differential effect that knowing the brand name has on customer response to the product or its marketing.
0438	Brand equity can be a powerful asset.
0439	Brand valuation is the process of estimating the total financial value of a brand.
0440	In order to build a strong brand, there are some major brand strategy decisions to be made.
0441	Brand positioning involves positioning the brand in the mind of the consumer  Brand name selection is important in order to select a good name.
0442	The brand name should say something about the service benefits and should be easy to pronounce and remember  It needs to be distinctive and extendable, easily translated and should be capable of legal protection.
0443	--- Brand sponsorship can be done via four ways.
0444	A product can be launched as a national (manufacturer) brand or as a private brand or store brand.
0445	Another way is via licensed brands or a co:brand with another company.
0446	A store brand is a brand created and owned by a reseller of a product or service.
0447	Licensing involves lending the brand name to other manufacturers.
0448	Co:branding is the practice of using the established brand names of two different companies on the same product.
0449	--- When developing brands, companies have four choices.
0450	Line extensions occur when extending an existing brand name to new forms, colours, sizes, ingredients or flavours of an existing product category.
0451	A brand extension extends a current brand name to new product categories.
0452	Multibrands means offering more than one brand in the same category.
0453	New brands can be created when believed that the power of existing brands is fading.
0454	Chapter 9: The product life cycle.
0455	New product development is the development of original products, product improvements, product modifications and new brands through the firm’s own product development efforts.
0456	New products are essential for the continuation of the company.
0457	New products aren’t easy to find.
0458	There are eight major steps in the product development process.
0459	Idea generation: the systematic search for new:product ideas.
0460	Ideas can be found via internal sources, but also external idea sources.
0461	These can be distributors, suppliers, but also competitors.
0462	Crowdsourcing means inviting broad communities of people – customers, employees, independent scientists and researchers and even the public at large – into the new:product innovation process.
0463	Idea screening: screening new:product ideas to spot good ideas and drop poor ones as soon as possible.
0464	Concept development and testing.
0465	Product concept is a detailed version of the new product idea stated in meaningful consumer terms.
0466	Concept testing means testing new product concepts with a group of target consumers to find out if the concepts have strong consumer appeal.
0467	Marketing strategy development: designing an initial marketing strategy for a new product based on the product concept.
0468	It consists of three parts: describing the target market and value proposition, outlining the budgets and lastly describing the long:term marketing mix strategy.
0469	Business analysis is a review of the sales, cost and profit projections for a new product to find out whether these factors satisfy the company’s objectives.
0470	Product development: developing the product concept into a physical product to ensure that the product idea can be turned into a workable market offering.
0471	Test marketing: the stage of new product development in which the product and its proposed marketing programme are tested in realistic market settings.
0472	This can be done in both controlled test markets and simulated test markets.
0473	Commercialisation: introducing a new product into the market.
0474	--- Customer:centred new product development: new product development that focuses on finding new ways to solve customer problems and create more customer satisfying experiences.
0475	Team:based new product development is an approach to developing new products in which various company departments work closely together, overlapping the steps in the product development process to save time and increase effectiveness.
0476	Systematic new product development is preferred over haphazard and compartmentalised development.
0477	Innovation can be messy and difficult to manage, especially in turbulent times.
0478	--- The product life cycle (PLC) is the course of product’s sales and profits over its lifetime.
0479	It involves five distinct stages:.
0480	Product development: development of the idea without any sales.
0481	Introduction: slow sales growth when the product is introduced.
0482	Growth: period of rapid acceptance.
0483	Maturity: period of sale slowdown because of acceptance by most potential buyers.
0484	Decline: the period when sales fall and the profit drops.
0485	--- The PLC concept can also be applied to styles, fashions and fads.
0486	A style is a basic and distinctive mode of expression.
0487	Fashion is a currently accepted or popular style in a given field.
0488	Fad is temporary period of unusually high sales driven by consumer enthusiasm and immediate product or brand popularity.
0489	Companies must continually innovate to keep up with the cycle.
0490	There are different strategies for each stage.
0491	--- The introduction stage is the PLC stage in which a new product is first distributed and made available for purchase.
0492	Profits are generally low and the initial strategy must be consistent with product positioning.
0493	--- The growth stage is the stage in which a product’s sales start climbing quickly.
0494	Profits increase and the firm faces a trade:off between high market share and high current profit.
0495	--- In the maturity stage, products sales are growing slowly or level off.
0496	The company tries to increase consumption by finding new consumers, also known as modifying the market.
0497	The company might also try to modify the product by changing characteristics.
0498	--- In the decline stage, the product’s sales are declining or dropping to zero.
0499	Management might decide to maintain the brand, reposition it or drop a product from the line.
0500	--- When introducing product in international markets, it must be decided which products to offer in which countries and how these product should be adapted.
0501	Packaging issues can be subtle, from translating issues to different meanings of logos.
0502	Chapter 10: Pricing strategies.
0503	A price is the amount of money charged for a product or a service, the sum of the values that customers exchange for the benefits of having or using the product or service.
0504	Price is the only element in the marketing mix that produces revenue, all others are costs.
0505	Setting the right price is one of the most complex tasks.
0506	Good pricing starts with customers and their perception of the value of the product.
0507	--- Customer value:based pricing: setting price based on buyer’s perceptions of value rather than on the seller’s cost.
0508	The value customers attach to a product might be difficult to measure, so the company must work hard to establish estimates.
0509	There are two other types of value:based pricing: good:value pricing and value:added pricing.
0510	Good:value pricing means offering the right combination of quality and good service at a fair price.
0511	Value:added pricing means attaching value:added features and services to differentiate a company’s offers and charging higher prices.
0512	--- Cost:based pricing means setting prices based on the cost for producing, distributing and selling the product plus a fair rate of return for effort and risk.
0513	There are two forms of costs: fixed costs (overhead) are costs that do not vary with production or sales level.
0514	Variable costs are costs that vary directly with the level of production.
0515	Total costs are the sum of the fixed and variable costs for any given level of production.
0516	--- The experience curve (learning curve) is the drop in the average per:unit production costs that comes with accumulated production experience.
0517	Put more simply: as workers become more experienced, they become more efficient and costs drop.
0518	--- The simplest pricing method is cost:plus pricing or mark:up pricing: it means adding a standard mark:up to the cost of the product.
0519	However, this method ignores demand and competitors prices and is therefore unlikely to lead to the best price.
0520	Break:even pricing (target return pricing) means setting the price to break even on the costs of making and marketing a product or setting price to make a target return.
0521	The break:even volume is the amount of units that need to be sold to break even.
0522	Competition:based pricing means setting prices based on competitor’s strategies, prices, costs and market offerings.
0523	--- Beyond customer value perceptions, costs and competitor prices, the firm must also think of other factors.
0524	Price is only one element of the marketing mix and the overall marketing strategy must be determined first.
0525	Target costing is pricing that starts with an ideal selling price and then targets costs that ensure the price is met.
0526	Good pricing is based on an understanding of the relationship between price and demand for the product.
0527	--- Pricing can differ in different types of markets.
0528	In pure competition markets, there are numerous buyers and sellers that all have little effect on the price.
0529	In monopolistic competition, there are many buyers and sellers who trade over multiple prices.
0530	In an oligopolistic competition market, there are few sellers who are highly sensitive to each other’s pricing strategies.
0531	In a pure monopoly, the company is the only seller and can set any price it desires.
0532	--- The demand curve is a curve that shows the number of units the market will buy in a given time period, at different prices that might be charged.
0533	The price elasticity is a measure of sensitivity of demand to changes in price.
0534	It is given by the following formula: price elasticity of demand =.
0535	Chapter 11: Pricing considerations.
0536	Pricing strategies can be challenging.
0537	There are two broad strategies.
0538	Market:skimming pricing (price skimming) means setting a high price for a new product to skim maximum revenues layer by layer from the segments willing to pay the high price, the company makes fewer but more profitable sales.
0539	Market:penetration pricing means setting a low price for a new product to attract a large number of buyers and a large market share.
0540	--- There are five product mix pricing situations.
0541	1 Product line pricing: setting the price steps between various products in a product line based on cost differences between the products, customer evaluations of different features and competitor’s prices.
0542	2 Optional product pricing: the pricing of optional or accessory products along with a main product.
0543	3 Captive product pricing: setting a price for products that must be used along with a main product.
0544	4 By:product pricing: setting a price for by:products to make the main product’s price more competitive.
0545	5 Product bundle pricing: combining several products and offering the bundle at a reduced price.
0546	--- There are also seven price adjustment strategies that can be used.
0547	1 Discount: a straight reduction in price on purchases during a stated period of time or of larger quantities.
0548	Allowance is promotional money paid by manufacturers to retailers in return for an agreement to feature the manufacturer’s products in some way.
0549	2 Segmented pricing: selling a product or service at two or more prices, where the difference in prices is not based on costs.
0550	Customer:segment pricing involves different types of customers paying different pricing.
0551	Product:form pricing involves different prices for different versions of the same product.
0552	Location:based pricing involves different prices for different locations, while time:based pricing involves different prices for different moments in time.
0553	3 Psychological pricing: pricing that considers the psychology of prices, not simply the economics, the price says something about the product.
0554	Reference prices are prices that buyers carry in their minds and refer to when they look at a given product.
0555	4 Promotional pricing: temporarily pricing products below the list price, and sometimes even below cost, to increase short:run sales.
0556	5 Geographical pricing: setting prices for customers located in different parts of the country or world.
0557	This can be FOB:origin pricing: a geographical pricing strategy in which goods are placed free on board a carrier, the customer pays the freight from the factory to the destination.
0558	Uniform:delivered pricing: a geographical pricing strategy in which the company charges the same price plus freight to all customers, regardless of their location.
0559	Zone pricing: the company sets up two or more zones.
0560	All customers within a zone pay the same total price, the more distant the zone, the higher the price.
0561	Base:point pricing: a pricing strategy in which the seller designates some city as a base point and charges all customers the freight cost from that city to the customer  Freight:absorption pricing is a strategy in which the seller absorbs all or part of the freight charges to get the desired business.
0562	6 Dynamic pricing means adjusting pricing continually to meet the characteristics and needs of individual customers and situations.
0563	7 International pricing: charging different pricing for customers in different countries.
0564	--- After setting prices, there are often situations in which companies need to change their prices.
0565	Sometimes, the company finds it desirable to initiate price cuts, for instance when demand is falling, or price increases to improve profits.
0566	Consumers can react differently to changes in prices, as well as competitors.
0567	When competitors change prices first, the firm has to respond.
0568	There are as many as four responses, namely: the firm can reduce its price, maintain its price but raise the perceived value of the product, improve the quality and increase the price or launch a low:price fighter brand to compete with the price change.
0569	--- There is legislation surrounding price fixing (talking to competitors to set prices), which is illegal.
0570	Predatory pricing (selling below costs to punish competitor) is also prohibited.
0571	Many countries also try to prevent unfair price discrimination and deceptive pricing.
0572	Chapter 12: Marketing channels.
0573	In order to produce a product, relationships with others in the supply chain are necessary.
0574	The term demand chain might be better, because it suggests a sense:and:respond view of the market.
0575	A value delivery network is composed of the company, suppliers, distributors and ultimately the customers, who partner with each other to improve the performance of the entire system in delivering customer value.
0576	The marketing channel (distribution channel) is a set of interdependent organisations that help make a product or service available for use or consumption by the consumer or business user  Channel members can add value by providing more efficiency and specialization in making goods.
0577	Some of the key function channel members do are: information gathering, promotion, contacting buyers, matching products and needs and negotiating agreements.
0578	But also physical distribution, financing and taking over risks of carrying out the work.
0579	--- A channel level is a layer of intermediaries that performs some work in bringing the product and its ownership closer to the final buyer  Channel 1 is a direct marketing channel: a marketing channel that has no intermediary levels.
0580	Indirect marketing channels are channels containing one or more intermediary levels.
0581	Channels are behavioural systems composed of real companies and people, who interact to accomplish goals.
0582	Each channel member depends on others and they behave differently, which can lead to channel conflict: disagreement among marketing channel members on goals, roles and rewards, who should do what and for what rewards.
0583	Horizontal conflict occurs among firms at the same channel level.
0584	Vertical conflict is between different levels of the same channel.
0585	--- For channels to work well, the role of the channel members must be specified.
0586	A conventional distribution channel is a channel consisting of one or more independent producers, wholesalers and retailers, each is a separate business seeking to maximise its own profits, even at the expense of profits for the system as a whole.
0587	In contrast with this is the vertical marketing system (VMS), a distribution channel in which producers, wholesalers and retailers act as a unified system.
0588	One channel member owns the others, has contracts with them or wields so much power that they all cooperate.
0589	There are three major types of VMSs:.
0590	1 Corporate VMS is a vertical marketing system that combines successive stages of production and distribution under single ownership.
0591	Channel leadership is accomplished through common ownership.
0592	2 Contractual VMS is a vertical marketing system in which independent firms at different levels of production and distribution join together through contracts.
0593	The most common example of a contractual VMS is the franchise organisation: a contractual marketing system in which a channel member (franchisor) links several stages in the production:distribution process.
0594	There are also three types of franchises: manufacturer:sponsored retailer franchise systems, manufacturer:sponsored wholesaler franchise systems and service:firm:sponsored retailer franchise systems.
0595	3 Administered VMS: a vertical marketing system that coordinates successive stages of production and distribution through the size and power of one of the parties.
0596	--- Another development regarding channels is the horizontal marketing system: a channel arrangement in which two or more companies at one level join together to follow a new marketing opportunity.
0597	This can be with competitors, but also with non:competitors.
0598	A multi:channel distribution system is a distribution system in which a single firm sets up two or more marketing channels to reach one or more customer segments.
0599	This occurs when a company sets up multiple marketing channels to reach multiple customer segments and is most beneficial in complex markets, but also brings additional risks.
0600	--- Current changes in the channel organisation include disintermediation, which is the cutting out of marketing channel intermediaries by product or service producers or the displacement of traditional resellers by radical new types of intermediaries.
0601	--- Channel design.
0602	Marketing channel design means designing effective marketing channels by analysing customer needs, setting channel objectives, identifying major channel alternatives and evaluating those alternatives.
0603	The base is analysing consumer needs, since marketing channels are actually customer value delivery networks.
0604	Next comes setting the channel objectives.
0605	When identifying major channel alternatives, the company should look at three things:.
0606	1 Types of intermediaries.
0607	The company should identify the different types of channel members that can be involved in the channel.
0608	2 The number of marketing intermediaries.
0609	Intensive distribution means stocking the product in as many outlets as possible.
0610	Exclusive distribution means giving a limited number of dealers the exclusive right to distribute the company’s products in their territories.
0611	Selective distribution involves the use of more than one, but fewer than all, intermediaries who are willing to carry the company’s products.
0612	3 The responsibilities of the intermediaries.
0613	Finally, the firm should evaluate all of the alternatives using economic criteria, control issues and adaptability criteria.
0614	--- Marketing channel management means selecting, managing and motivating individual channel members and evaluating their performance over time.
0615	Managing and motivating other channel members means practicing partner relationship management to build long:term partnerships with other channel members.
0616	--- Marketing logistics, or physical distribution, is the planning, implementing and controlling the physical flow of materials, final goods and related information from points of origin to points of consumption to meet customer requirements at a profit.
0617	It basically means getting the right product to the right customer at the right place and time.
0618	It includes both outbound (from company to customer) and inbound distribution (within the channel) and reverse distribution (moving returned products).
0619	--- It involves the entire supply chain management: managing upstream and downstream value:added flows of materials, final goods and related information among suppliers, the company, resellers and final consumers.
0620	Logistics can be a source of competitive advantage and efficient ones can cut cost drastically.
0621	There is however a trade:off between minimal distribution costs and maximum customer service.
0622	Logistics include some major functions:.
0623	1 Warehousing.
0624	Distribution centres are large, highly automated warehouses designed to receive goods from various plants and suppliers, take orders, fill them efficiently and deliver goods to customers as quickly as possible.
0625	2 Stock management involves deciding on the balance between too little and too much stock.
0626	Just:in:time logistic systems involve small stocks, while new stock arrives exactly when needed.
0627	3 Transportation affects the pricing of products, delivery times and the condition of the goods.
0628	It can be via road, but also via railways, waterways and air carriers.
0629	Intermodal transportation means combining two or more modes of transportation.
0630	--- Integrated logistics management is the logistics concept that emphasises teamwork, both inside the company and among all the marketing channel organisations, to maximise the performance of the entire distribution system.
0631	Cross:functional teamwork inside the company means an integrated and harmonized system.
0632	Companies should not only improve their logistics, but also their logistic partnerships.
0633	Third:party logistics (3PL) provider is an independent logistics provider that performs any or all of the functions required to get a client’s product to the market.
0634	They often do this at a lower cost and more efficiently, while the company can focus on its core business.
0635	Chapter 13: Retailing and wholesaling.
0636	Retailing includes all the activities involved in selling goods or services directly to final consumer for their personal, non:business use.
0637	Retailers are businesses whose sales come primarily from retailing.
0638	Retailing connects brands to consumers in the final steps (“last mile” of buying process).
0639	Shopper marketing means using in:store promotions and advertising to extend brand equity to the “last mile” and encourage favourable hi:store purchase decisions.
0640	There are different types of retailers.
0641	Self:service retailers serve customers who are willing to perform part of the service.
0642	Limited:service retailers provide some assistance in the service process, while full:service retailers assist customers in every step of the buying process.
0643	--- Retailers can also be classified by the length and breadth of their product line.
0644	1 Speciality store: a retail store that carries a narrow product line with a deep assortment within that line.
0645	2 Department store: a retail organisation that carries a wide variety of product lines.
0646	Each line is operated as a separate department managed by specialist buyers or merchandisers.
0647	3 Supermarkets are large, low:cost, low:margin, high:volume and self:service stores that carry a wide variety of grocery and household products.
0648	4 Convenience stores are mall stores, located near residential areas and that carry a limited line of high:turnover convenience goods.
0649	5 Superstore: a store much larger than a regular supermarket that offers a large assortment of routinely purchased food products, non:food items and services.
0650	6 Category killer: a giant speciality store that carries a very deep assortment of a particular line and is staffed by knowledgeable employees.
0651	7 Service retailers: a retailer whose product line is actually a service.
0652	--- Retailers can also be classified according to the price they charge for their goods and services.
0653	: Discount store: a retail operation that sells standard merchandise at lower prices by accepting lower margins and selling at higher volume.
0654	: Off:price retailers are retailers that buy at less:than:regular wholesale price and sell at less than retail.
0655	: Independent off:price retailers are off:price retailers who are either independently owned or is a division of a larger retail corporation.
0656	: Factory outlet: an off:price retailing operation that is owned and operated by a manufacturer and normally carries the manufacturer’s surplus discontinued or irregular goods.
0657	: Warehouse clubs: an off:price retailer that sells a limited selection of brand name grocery items, appliances, clothing and a hodgepodge of other goods at deep discounts to members who pay annual membership fees.
0658	--- Chain stores are two or more outlets that are commonly owned and controlled.
0659	Their size allows for buying in large quantities at lower prices.
0660	A franchise is a contractual association between a manufacturer, wholesaler or service organisation and independent businesspeople, who buy the right to own and operate one or more units in the franchise system.
0661	Retailers must first segment and define their target market, before deciding upon how to differentiate and position themselves in these target markets.
0662	Retailers must decide upon three major product variables: product assortment, services mix and store atmosphere.
0663	The product assortment should differentiate the retailer from competitors.
0664	The services mix can help differentiate, while the store’s atmosphere is another unique element to distinguish the retailer --- The price a retailer asks for its product must fit the target market and position of the retailer  Retailers can use all of the five promotion tools to reach their customers, namely: advertising, personal selling, sales promotion, public relations and direct marketing.
0665	The place of the products, or location, is vital in retailing success.
0666	A shopping centre is a group of retail businesses built on a site that is planned, developed, owned and managed as a unit.
0667	A regional shopping centre is large, containing more than 50 to 100 stores.
0668	A community shopping centre contains between 15 and 50 retailers.
0669	A neighbourhood shopping centre or strip mall generally holds 5 to 15 stores.
0670	Power centres are huge unenclosed shopping centres consisting of long strips of retail stores.
0671	A lifestyle centre is a smaller open:air mall with upmarket stores.
0672	--- Trends in retailing.
0673	In current times, retailers are dealing with changing lifestyles and fierce competition for customer expenditure.
0674	The economic downturn provides a challenge for a lot of retailers.
0675	The wheel:of:retailing concept states that new types of retailers usually begin as low:margin, low:price, low:status operations but later evolve into higher priced, higher:service operations, eventually becoming like the conventional retailers they replaced.
0676	The rise of mega:retailers also has its influence on the environment, squeezing out small competitors.
0677	The growth of non:store retailing via advanced technologies also provides new opportunities and challenges.
0678	Retailing technologies have become important as competitive tools.
0679	There is also a trend of green retailing, where retailers are adopting environmentally sustainable practices.
0680	--- Wholesaling.
0681	Wholesaling includes all the activities involved in selling goods and services to those buying for resale or business use.
0682	A wholesaler is a firm engaged primarily in wholesaling activities.
0683	Wholesalers add value by performing one or multiple of the following channel functions:.
0684	: Selling and promoting and thereby reaching many small customers.
0685	: Buying and assortment building.
0686	: Bulk breaking by buying in large quantities.
0687	: Warehousing and holding stock.
0688	: Transportation.
0689	: Financing of customers and suppliers.
0690	: Risk bearing.
0691	: Providing market information.
0692	: The management of services and giving advice.
0693	--- Wholesalers fall into three major groups.
0694	1 Merchant wholesalers are independently owned wholesale businesses that take title to the merchandise it handles.
0695	They include full:service wholesalers, who provide a full set of services and limited:service wholesalers who offer less services to their customers.
0696	Industrial distributors sell to manufacturers, while wholesale merchants sell primarily to retailers.
0697	Cash:and:carry wholesalers carry a limited line of fast moving goods.
0698	Drop shippers never carry stock, but select manufacturers who ship the product upon order.
0699	2 Brokers and agents.
0700	A broker is a wholesaler who does not take title to goods and whose function is to bring buyers and sellers together and assist in negotiation.
0701	An agent is a wholesaler who represents buyers or sellers on a relatively permanent basis, performs only a few functions and does not take title to goods.
0702	Selling agents have contractual authority to sell a manufacturer’s entire output.
0703	Purchasing agents often have long:term relationships with buyers and make purchases for them.
0704	3 Manufacturers’ sales branches and offices: wholesaling by seller or buyers themselves rather than through independent wholesalers.
0705	--- Like retailers, wholesalers must also decide upon the product, prices, promotion and place of their services.
0706	Today’s wholesalers are facing challenges in the need for greater efficiency and changing needs of customers.
0707	Chapter 14: Communications strategy.
0708	The promotion mix (marketing communication mix) is the specific blend of promotion tools that the company uses to persuasively communicate customer value and build customer relationships.
0709	It consists of five major promotion tools:.
0710	1 Advertising: any paid form of non:personal presentation and promotion of ideas, goods or services by an identified sponsor.
0711	2 Sales promotion: short:term incentives to encourage the purchase or sale of a product or a service.
0712	3 Personal selling: personal representation by the firm’s sales force for the purpose of making sales and building customer relationships.
0713	4 Public relations: building good relations with the company’s various public by obtaining favourable publicity: building up a good corporate image and handling or heading off unfavourable rumours, stories and events.
0714	5 Direct marketing: direct connections with carefully targeted individual consumers to both obtain an immediate response and cultivate lasting customer relationships.
0715	--- Several factors are changing today’s marketing communication.
0716	First, consumers are changing: they are better informed and more empowered.
0717	Also, marketing strategies are shifting away from traditional mass marketing.
0718	Finally, communications technology is changing the way companies and customers communicate with each other  These changes come together in a need for integrated marketing communications (IMC) which involves carefully integrating and coordinating the company’s many communications channels to deliver a clear, consistent and compelling message about an organisation and its products.
0719	IMC recognizes all touchpoints where the company and customers meet and ties together all messages.
0720	--- In order to develop marketing communications, an understanding of the communication process is required.
0721	A message is send from a sender to a receiver via media, but can be interrupted by noise or encoding/decoding differences.
0722	--- There are different steps necessary in developing effective marketing communication.
0723	1 Identifying the target audience.
0724	2 Determining the communication objectives.
0725	The target audience can be in any stage of the buyer:readiness stages.
0726	The buyer:readiness stages are the stages consumers normally pass through on their way to a purchase, including awareness, knowledge, liking, preference, conviction and finally the actual purchase.
0727	A goal of a marketer is to move target customers through the buying process.
0728	3 Designing the message.
0729	The message should get attention, hold interest, arouse desire and obtain action.
0730	Attention, interest, desire and action come together as the AIDA model.
0731	The marketer determines the content of the message.
0732	Rational appeals relate to the audience self:interest and their benefits.
0733	Emotional appeals attempt to stir up emotions that can motivate purchase.
0734	Marketers must also decide the message structure and the format.
0735	4 Choosing the channels of communication.
0736	There are two broad categories.
0737	Personal communication channels are channels through which two or more people communicate directly with each other, including face to face, on the phone, via e:mail or even through Internet chat.
0738	Personal communication channels include word:of:mouth influence: personal communications about a product between target buyers and neighbours, friends, family members and associates.
0739	Buzz marketing is cultivating opinion leaders and getting them to spread information about a product or a service to others in their communities.
0740	--- Non:personal communication channels are media that carry messages without personal contact or feedback, including major media, atmospheres and events.
0741	Atmospheres are designed environments that create the buyer’s leanings toward buying a product.
0742	5 Selecting the message source.
0743	Highly credible sources are more persuasive.
0744	6 Collecting feedback.
0745	The marketer must research the effect on the target audience.
0746	--- When setting the total promotion budget, there are four common methods that can be used.
0747	1 Affordable method: setting the promotion budget at the level management thinks the company can afford.
0748	2 Percentage:of:sales method: setting the promotion budget at a certain percentage of current or forecasted sales or as a percentage of the unit sales prices.
0749	3 Competitive:parity method: setting the promotion budget to match competitor’s outlays.
0750	4 Objective:and:task method: developing the promotion budget by (1) defining specific promotion objectives, (2) determining the tasks needed to achieve these objectives and (3) estimating the cost of performing these tasks.
0751	The sum of these costs is the proposed promotion budget.
0752	--- The promotion mix.
0753	The promotion mix consists of five tools.
0754	Advertising can reach masses of geographically dispersed buyers at a low cost, but it cannot be as persuasive as people.
0755	Personal selling is the most effective in certain stages of the buying process, but is quite costly.
0756	Sales promotion attracts the customer’s attention, but the effect is often short lived.
0757	Public relations (PR) is believable but is often underused.
0758	Direct marketing is less public and delivered to a certain person.
0759	--- Marketers can choose from two basic promotion mix strategies.
0760	A push strategy calls for using the sales force and trade promotion to push a product through channels.
0761	A producer promotes a particular product to channel members, who in turn promote it to final consumers.
0762	A pull strategy calls for spending a lot on consumer advertising and promotion to induce final consumers to buy a particular product, creating a demand vacuum that “pulls” a product through the channel.
0763	--- Having set the promotion budget and mix, the next task is to integrate into a promotion mix.
0764	There are legal and ethical issues to consider when thinking about marketing communications.
0765	Marketers must avoid false or deceptive advertising and must follow the rules of fair competition.
0766	Chapter 15: Advertising and PR  Advertising is any paid form of non:personal presentation and promotion of ideas, goods or services by an identified sponsor  The first step to advertising is setting advertising objectives based on past decisions on the target market, positioning and the marketing mix.
0767	An advertising objective is a specific communication task to be accomplished with a specific target audience during a specific period of time.
0768	Informative advertising is often used when introducing a new product.
0769	Persuasive advertising is more used when competition is increasing.
0770	Reminder advertising is relevant for mature products and is used to maintain customer relationships.
0771	--- After setting the advertising objectives, the advertising budget is set.
0772	The advertising budget is the money and other resources allocated to a product or a company advertising programme.
0773	The budget is often dependent of multiple factors, such as the stage in the product life cycle, market share and the number of competitors in the market.
0774	--- The next thing in the advertising process is developing an advertising strategy: the strategy by which the company accomplishes its advertising objectives.
0775	It consists of two major elements: creative advertising messages and selecting advertising media.
0776	--- The advertising message.
0777	When creating the advertising message, it is important to gain the attention of the customer and to stand out from the clutter of all other advertisements.
0778	In order to stand out, many marketers use “Madison & Vine”, a term that has come to represent the merging of advertising and entertainment in an effort to break through the clutter and create new avenues for reaching consumers with more engaging messages.
0779	The aim of “advertainment” is to make ads entertaining enough, so that people actually want to watch them.
0780	Branded entertainment, or brand integrations, involves making the brand an inseparable part of some form of entertainment.
0781	--- The message strategy is the general message that will be communicated to consumers.
0782	The creative concept is the compelling “big idea” that will bring the advertising message strategy to life in a distinctive and memorable way.
0783	Advertising appeals should have three characteristics.
0784	They should be meaningful, believable and distinctive.
0785	After that, the message needs to be executed.
0786	There are different execution styles: the approach style, tone, words and format used for executing an advertising message.
0787	Some styles are:.
0788	: Slice of life: normal people using a product in a normal setting.
0789	: Lifestyle: shows how a product fits within a certain lifestyle.
0790	: Fantasy.
0791	: Mood or image: builds a mood or certain image around the product.
0792	: Musical: singing advertisement.
0793	: Personality symbol: creates a character that represents the product.
0794	: Technical expertise.
0795	: Scientific evidence: proving the brand is better.
0796	: Testimonial evidence or endorsement: featuring a highly believable or likable source.
0797	The marketer must also decide upon the tone and format of the advertisement.
0798	The illustration is the first thing noticed, while the headline must entice the right people to read to advertisement.
0799	The copy (main block of text in the ad) must be simple, strong and convincing All of the elements must work together in order to persuade the customer --- The other major part of developing an advertisement strategy is selecting advertising media.
0800	Advertising media are the vehicles through which advertising messages are delivered to their intended audiences.
0801	To select media, a marketer must decide upon the reach and frequency of advertising that is desired.
0802	Reach is a measure of the percentage of people reached in the target market, while frequency is a measure to show how many times the average person is exposed to the message.
0803	--- An advertiser will want to reach the desired media impact: the qualitative value of the message exposure.
0804	Media planners must also choose the best media vehicles: specific media within each general media type.
0805	Furthermore, they need to consider audience quality, audience engagement and editorial quality.
0806	Some media sources are more believable than others.
0807	Finally, the advertiser must decide upon the media timing.
0808	Continuity means scheduling ads evenly within a given period, while pulsing means scheduling ads unevenly over a given time period.
0809	--- Measuring advertising effectiveness and the return on advertising are becoming important.
0810	Return on advertising investment is the net return on advertising investment divided by the costs of the advertising investment.
0811	There are two types of advertising results: communication effects and sales and profit effects.
0812	--- Advertising is organised differently in different companies.
0813	It ranges from someone handling it in the sales department, to advertising departments and advertising agencies: a marketing services firm that assists companies in planning, preparing, implementing and evaluating all or portions of their advertising programmes.
0814	--- Public relations (PR) means building good relations with the company’s various publics by obtaining favourable publicity, building up a good corporate image and heading off unfavourable rumours, stories and events.
0815	Activities involved in PR are press relations, product publicity, public affairs, lobbying and managing investor relations.
0816	PR can have a strong impact on public awareness and results can be impressing.
0817	Some of the most important tools of PR are the news, speeches, written materials, audio:visual material and public services activities.
0818	Chapter 16: Personal selling.
0819	Personal selling: are personal presentations by the firm’s sales force for the purpose of making sales and building customer relationships.
0820	A salesperson is an individual representing a company to customers by performing one or more of the following activities: prospecting, communicating, selling, services, information gathering and relationship building.
0821	Personal selling is an interpersonal part of the promotion mix.
0822	The sales force is a link between the company and its customers.
0823	Sales people represent the company to customers, but at the same time they represent customers to a particular company.
0824	The sales force should work closely with other marketing functions in order to create value for its customers, but often sales and marketing are approached as different functions.
0825	--- Sales force management means analysing, planning, implementing and controlling sales force activities.
0826	There are six major steps in the sales force management process:--- 1 Designing the sales force strategy.
0827	The sales force structure can have different shapes.
0828	A territorial sales force structure is a sales force organisation that assigns each salesperson to an exclusive geographic territory in which that salesperson sells the company’s full line.
0829	Territory sales representatives report to territory managers, who are under the supervision of regional managers, who in turn report to a director of sales.
0830	--- A product sales force structure is a sales force organisation in which salespersons specialise in selling only a portion of the company’s products or lines.
0831	This might lead to trouble when customers buy multiple products of the same company and could lead to double work.
0832	--- A customer or market sales force structure is a sales force organisation in which salespeople specialise in selling only to certain customers or industries.
0833	This can help a company build closer relationships with meaningful customers.
0834	--- Finally combinations of sales force structures are possible, leading to complex structures.
0835	Once the structure is set, the sales force size must be determined.
0836	This can be done by the workload approach, where the number or salespersons are based on the amount of effort desired for different classes of work.
0837	Sales management must also determine who will be involved in the sales force.
0838	Outside sales force (field sales force) are salespeople who travel to call on customers in the field.
0839	Inside sales force are salespeople who conduct business from their offices via telephone, the Internet or visits from prospective buyers.
0840	Team selling means using a team of people from sales, marketing, engineering, finance, technical support an even upper management to service large, complex accounts.
0841	--- 2 Recruiting salespeople.
0842	The success of a sales force operations depends on the skills of salespeople.
0843	Good sales people are motivated, disciplined, have skills and knowledge and a great understanding of customer needs.
0844	--- 3 Training salespeople.
0845	Most companies provide continuous sales training.
0846	Training programmes teach salespeople what they need to know about their customers and give them the necessary skills.
0847	--- 4 Compensating salespeople.
0848	To attract good salespeople, they need to be compensated.
0849	Compensation can consist of four elements: a fixed amount, a variable amount, expenses and fringe benefits.
0850	--- 5 Supervising salespeople.
0851	The goal of supervision is to help salespeople work smart, by doing the right things the right way.
0852	Motivation helps salespeople to work hard to reach the sales force goals.
0853	Supervising salespeople can be done by period call plans and time:and:duty analysis.
0854	Sales 2 0 is the merging of innovative sales practices within Web 2 0 technologies to improve sales force effectiveness and efficiency.
0855	Beyond directing, sales managers must also motivate salespeople.
0856	Sales quota are standards that state the amount a salesperson should sell and how sales should be divided among the company’s products.
0857	Organisational climate describes the feeling salespeople have about their opportunities and rewards.
0858	Sales meetings provide occasions to air feelings.
0859	--- 6 Evaluating salespeople.
0860	The last step in the process is evaluating the salespeople.
0861	Information can be gathered in different ways: via sales reports call reports and expense reports.
0862	--- The selling process are the steps that salespeople follow when selling, which include prospecting and qualifying, pre:approaching, presenting an demonstrating, handling objections, closing and following up.
0863	1 Prospecting: a salesperson or company identifies qualified potential customers.
0864	2 Pre:approaching: a salesperson learns as much as possible about a prospective customer before making a sales call.
0865	3 Approaching: a salesperson meets the customer for the first time.
0866	4 Presenting: a salesperson tells the “value story” to the buyers, showing how the company’s offer solves the customer’s problems.
0867	5 Handling objections: a salesperson seeks out, clarifies and overcomes any customer objections to buying.
0868	6 Closing: a salesperson asks the customer for an order.
0869	7 Following up: a salesperson follows up after the sale to ensure customer satisfaction and repeat business.
0870	The steps in the selling process can be described as transaction oriented.
0871	But in most cases, the long:term goals are to develop a profitable relationship.
0872	--- Sales promotion: short:term incentives to encourage the purchase or sale of product or service.
0873	Sales promotions tools are used by most companies and can be consumer promotions, trade promotions, business promotions and sales force promotions.
0874	Sales promotion objectives can vary widely and are used together with other promotion mix tools.
0875	--- Consumer promotions are sales promotion tools used to boost short:term customer buying and involvement or enhance long:term customer relationships.
0876	These can be samples (trial products), coupons (saving certificates), cash refunds, price packs (money:off deals), or premiums (goods offered at low cost).
0877	But also promotional products, point:of:sales (POS) promotions (displays and demonstrations) and contests and games are sales promotion tools.
0878	Event marketing (event sponsorship) means creating a brand:marketing event or serving as a sole or participating sponsor of events created by others.
0879	--- Trade promotions are sales promotion tools used to persuade resellers to carry a brand, give it shelf space, promote it in advertising and push it to consumers.
0880	Business promotions are sales promotion tools used to generate business leads, stimulate purchases, reward customers and motivate salespeople.
0881	Chapter 17: Direct customer relationships.
0882	Direct marketing means connecting directly with carefully targeted segments of individual consumers, often on a one:to:one, interactive basis.
0883	For most companies, direct marketing is a supplemental channel, but for others it is a complete way of doing business.
0884	Direct marketing is expanding, it is key to the trend towards building close and interactive customer relationships.
0885	Direct marketing has certain benefits for buyers: it is convenient, private, easy and gives a lot of comparative information.
0886	It also has benefits for sellers: it is an important tool for building customer relationships and is a low:cost and efficient way of reaching target markets.
0887	Direct marketing begins with a good customer database.
0888	--- A customer database is an organised collection of comprehensive data about individual customers or prospects, including geographic, demographic, psychographic and behavioural data.
0889	Companies can use this database to located potential customers, learn about their customers and build relationships with them.
0890	There are several major forms of direct marketing:.
0891	: Direct:mail marketing: direct marketing by sending an offer, announcement, reminder or other item to a person at a particular physical or virtual address.

0894	They eliminate mailing costs and allow for real:time merchandising.

0900	: New digital direct:marketing technologies such as mobile phone marketing, podcasts/vodcasts and interactive TV are upcoming tools.
0901	--- Online marketing are efforts to market products and service and build customer relationships over the internet.
0902	The Internet is a vast public web of computer networks that connects users of all types around the world to each other and an amazingly large information repository.
0903	Click:only companies are the so:called dot:coms, which operate only online and have no brick:and:mortar market presence.
0904	Click:and:mortar companies are traditional brick:and:mortar companies that have added online marketing to their operations.
0905	There are four major online marketing domains.
0906	1 Business:to:consumer (B:to:C) online marketing: businesses selling goods and services online to final consumers.
0907	2 Business:to:business (B:to:B) online marketing: businesses using online marketing to reach new business customers serve current customers more effectively and obtain buying efficiencies and better prices.
0908	3 Consumer:to:consumer (C:to:C) online marketing: online exchanges of goods and information between final consumers.

0910	Companies can also advertise on blogs and influence content there.
0911	4 Consumer:to:business (C:to:B) online marketing: online exchanges in which consumers search out sellers, learn about their offers and initiate purchases, sometimes even driving transaction terms.
0912	--- Either way, most companies now exist online.
0913	Corporate (brand) websites are websites designed to build customer goodwill, collect customer feedback and supplement other sales channels rather than sell the company’s products directly.
0914	A marketing website is a website that engages consumers in interactions that will move them closer to a direct purchase or other marketing outcome.
0915	However, creating a website is not enough, sites must be visited and therefor a website must be promoted.
0916	This can be done via online advertising: advertising that appears while consumers are browsing the Web, including display ads, search:related ads, online classifieds and other forms.
0917	Rich media allow animation, sound, video and interactivity.
0918	The largest form of online advertising is search:related ads (or contextual advertising).
0919	Viral marketing is the Internet version of word:of:mouth marketing: websites, videos, email messages or other marketing events that are so infectious that customers will want to pass them along to friends.
0920	--- Online social networks: online social communities, blogs, social networking websites or even virtual worlds, where people socialise or exchange information and opinions.
0921	Marketers can engage in online social networks by participating in existing Web communities or establishing their own.
0922	Social networking sites presents challenges, since companies do not really know how to use them effectively.
0923	E:mail is an important and growing online marketing tool and it can be the ultimate marketing medium.
0924	However, the explosion of spam (unsolicited, unwanted commercial e:mail messages) can lead to customer irritation.
0925	--- The direct:marketing industry has been facing some privacy concerns and cases of unfair practices.
0926	Direct marketing can sometimes annoy customers.
0927	Internet fraud has become a serious problem.
0928	Phishing, a type of online identity theft uses deceptive emails to fool users into divulging their personal data.
0929	Customers also worry about online security and their privacy.
0930	Many online marketers have become skilled at obtaining detailed consumer information.
0931	Because of these challenges, various governments are putting up legislation to protect customers.
0932	Chapter 18: Competitive advantage.
0933	A competitive advantage is an advantage over competitors gained by offering consumers greater value than competitors do.
0934	Competitive marketing strategies exist of competitor analysis and developing competitive marketing strategies.
0935	Competitive marketing strategies are strategies that strongly position the company against competitors and give the company the strongest possible strategic advantage.
0936	Competitor analysis is the process of identifying key competitors, assessing their objectives, strategies, strengths and weaknesses and reaction patterns, and selecting which competitors to attack or avoid.
0937	It consists of three steps.
0938	1 Identifying competitors.
0939	This might seem easy, but companies face a lot more competitors than can be identified at first sight.
0940	Competitors can be identified from an industry point or a market point of view.
0941	2 Assessing competitors.
0942	When doing so, firms need to look at the competitor’s objectives and identify competitor’s strategies.
0943	A strategic group is a group of firms in an industry following the same or a similar strategy.
0944	It is also important to assess the strengths and weakness of competitors.
0945	This way, the firm can benchmark.
0946	Benchmarking is the process of comparing one company’s products and processes to those of competitors or leading firms in other industries to identify best practices and find ways to improve quality and performance.
0947	Finally, the firm can estimate how competitors will react to changes and anticipate their moves.
0948	3 Selecting which competitors to attack and avoid.
0949	A useful tool for assessing competitor’s strengths and weaknesses is the customer value analysis: an analysis conducted to determine what benefits target customer’s value and how they rate the relative value of various competitors’ offers.
0950	The key to gaining competitive advantage is to take each segment and examine how the company’s offer compares to that of competitors.
0951	Most companies compete with close competitors, but they will also have distant competitors.
0952	Firms also benefit from having competitors, they share the costs of market development and competitors may increase total demand.
0953	--- When the competitors are identified and evaluated, the firm must design a competitive strategy.
0954	Strategies differ for every company.
0955	Approaches to marketing strategy often pass through three stages: entrepreneurial marketing, formulated marketing and intrepreneurial marketing.
0956	--- Entrepreneurial marketing: most companies are started by individuals who have no explicit strategy.
0957	Formulated marketing: as small companies are more successful, they move to more formulated strategies.
0958	Intrepreneurial marketing: many large companies get stuck in formulated marketing and should re:establish their entrepreneurial spirit.
0959	--- Porter’s strategies.
0960	Porter is famous for his competitive positioning strategies: three winning ones and one losing one.
0961	The three winning strategies are:.
0962	: Cost leadership: the firm has the lowest production costs and can therefore ask the lowest prices.
0963	: Differentiation: the firm creates a highly differentiated product.
0964	: Focus strategy: the firm focuses on a small niche market segment.
0965	The losing strategy is the “middle of the roaders” and applies to firms with no clear strategy.
0966	--- Companies can pursue any of three value discipline for delivering superior customer value:.
0967	: Operational excellence: the firm has leads in the industry by price and convenience.
0968	: Customer intimacy: the firm provides superior value by precisely tailoring its products to match the needs of their customers.
0969	: Product leadership: the firm provides superior value by offering a continuous stream of superior products.
0970	--- There are multiple competitive positions in a given market.
0971	1 Market leader: the firm in an industry with the largest market share.
0972	The leader has the largest market share and usually sets the pace in the market.
0973	Market leaders can encourage users to usage their products more.
0974	Leaders must be constantly prepared for other firms challenging its strengths.
0975	Sometimes attack is the best defence, and market leaders should continuously innovate.
0976	2 Market challenger: a runner:up firm that is fighting hard to increase market share in an industry.
0977	The runner:up can either challenge the market leader or play along with competitors and not “rock the boat”.
0978	Challengers often become leaders by imitating and improving the ideas of previous leaders.
0979	It can attack the leader by a full frontal attack, by attacking the leader’s strengths but also by an indirect attack by attacking the leader’s weaknesses.
0980	3 Market follower: a runner:up firm that wants to hold its share in an industry without rocking the boat.
0981	Followers can learn from the leader (who pays for the cost of innovation).
0982	A follower must know how to current customers and win new ones.
0983	4 Market nicher: a firm that serves small segments that the other firms in an industry overlook or ignore.
0984	By focusing on such a specific segment, the firms are often good in exactly matching the product to customer needs.
0985	--- However, a company can also focus too much on its competitors.
0986	A competitor:centred company is a company whose moves are mainly based on competitor’s actions and reactions.
0987	A customer:centred company is a company that focuses on customer developments in designing its marketing strategies and delivering superior value to its target customers.
0988	A market:centred company is a company that pays balanced attention to both customers and competitors in designing its marketing strategies.
0989	Chapter 19: Global marketplace.
0990	As global trade grows, global marketing also intensifies.
0991	A global firm is a firm that, by operating in more than one country, gains R&D, production, marketing and financial advantages in its costs and reputation that are not available to purely domestic competitors.
0992	A company faces six major decisions in international marketing.
0993	--- 1 Looking at the global marketing environment.
0994	Companies must start by understanding the international trade system.
0995	Countries may set quotas and limits on the amount of foreign import, which can lead to barriers.
0996	But there are also forces helping the trade between nations.
0997	The GATT is a treaty to promote word trade by reducing trade barriers.
0998	The World Trade Organization was created to enforce the GATT rules.
0999	--- Certain countries have formed free:trade or economic communities: a group of nations organised to work toward common goals in the regulation of international trade, such as the EU --- The international marketer must pay attention to the economic environment.
1000	The industrial structure shapes its product and service needs.
1001	The four types of industrial structures are as follows:.
1002	: Subsistence economies: the vast majority of people engage in simple agriculture, which they consume themselves.
1003	: Raw material exporting economies: economies are rich in natural resources, but not all of them.
1004	Revenue comes from exporting these resources.
1005	: Emerging economies are industrialising economies with rapid growth.
1006	: Industrial economies are major exporters of manufactured goods.
1007	Besides the industrial structure, the income distribution is also of importance.
1008	--- Next to the economic environment, international marketers must also look at the political/legal environment, such as political stability and monetary regulations, and the cultural environment.
1009	Culture can have a big impact on marketing strategy.
1010	When advertising, cultural differences must be taken into account.
1011	--- 2 Deciding whether to go global.
1012	Not all companies decide to dive into international markets.
1013	Local businesses only need to be present in their local marketplace.
1014	However, companies that operate in global industries often are strongly affected by global positions.
1015	--- 3 Deciding which markets to enter.
1016	Before going abroad, the company should define their international marketing objectives and policies.
1017	Most companies start small when they go abroad.
1018	Firms need to choose how many countries and the types of countries to enter --- 4 Deciding how to enter the market.
1019	Once a company has decided upon entering a country, there are different modes of entry.
1020	Exporting is entering a foreign market by selling goods produced in a company’s home country, often with little modification.
1021	--- Joint venturing is entering foreign markets by joining with foreign companies to produce or market a product or services.
1022	Licensing is a method of entering a foreign market in which a company enters into an agreement with a licensee in a foreign market.
1023	Contract manufacturing is a joint venture in which a company contracts with manufacturers in a foreign market to produce a product or provide a service.
1024	Management contracting: a joint venture in which a domestic firm supplies the management know:how to a foreign company that supplies the capital, the domestic firm exports management services rather than products.
1025	Joint ownership is a joint venture in which a company joins investors in a foreign market to create local business in which a company shares joint ownership and control.
1026	--- Direct investment means entering a foreign market by developing foreign:based assembly or manufacturing facilities.
1027	The major global marketing decision is how much a firm should adapt is marketing strategy to local markets.
1028	--- 5 Deciding on the global marketing programme.
1029	There are two extremes when deciding on adapting the marketing strategy.
1030	At one point is the standardised global marketing: an international marketing strategy that basically uses the same marketing strategy and mix in all of a company’s international markets.
1031	At the other end is adapted global marketing: an international marketing strategy that adjusts the marketing strategy and mix elements to each international target market, bearing more costs but hoping for a larger market share and return.
1032	--- There are five strategies that allow for adapting product and marketing communication strategies to a global market.
1033	Three of them apply to the product, namely straight product extension, product adaption and product invention.
1034	Straight product extension means marketing a product in a foreign market without any change.
1035	Product adaption means adapting a product to meet local conditions or wants in foreign markets.
1036	Product invention means creating new products or services for foreign markets.
1037	--- The other two apply to the communication strategy.
1038	Communication adaption means a global communication strategy of fully adapting advertising messages to local markets.
1039	In dual adaption, both the product and the communication strategy are adapted.
1040	Companies may also consider adapting their prices.
1041	--- An international company must take a whole:channel view of the problem of distributing products.
1042	A whole:channel view means designing international channels that take into account the entire global supply chain and marketing channel, forging an effective global value delivery network.
1043	It connects sellers with final buyers via channels between nations and channels within nations.
1044	--- 6 Deciding on the global marketing organisation.
1045	Most companies manage their international marketing activities in three ways.
1046	First they organise an export department, then create an international division and final become a global organisation.
1047	International divisions can be geographical organisations, world product groups or international subsidiaries.
1048	--- Today, major companies must become more global if they hope to compete.
1049	Chapter 20: Sustainable marketing.
1050	Sustainable marketing is socially and environmentally responsible marketing that meets the present needs of consumers and business while also preserving or enhancing the ability of future generations to meet their needs.
1051	Only satisfying consumers’ immediate needs, does not always serve the future best interest of either customers or the business.
1052	The sustainable marketing concepts considers both strategic planning and societal marketing.
1053	Marketing receives much criticism.
1054	Many critics say that marketing causes prices to be higher, because of three reasons.
1055	The high costs of intermediaries in the distribution channel lead to price increases, as well as high advertising and promotion costs and excessive mark:ups.
1056	There is also criticism of deceptive practices.
1057	These can be because of deceptive pricing, deceptive promotion and deceptive packaging.
1058	Deceptive practices have led to legislation and other consumer protection actions.
1059	Salespeople are sometimes accused of high:pressure selling, because they persuade people to buy goods these consumers did not really wanted before.
1060	Another criticism concerns poor product quality or function.
1061	Some companies have been accused of planned obsolescence, causing their products to become obsolete on purpose, so that they need replacement.
1062	A final piece of criticism is that of poor service to disadvantaged consumers.
1063	Marketing also has an impact on society as a whole.
1064	Critics state that marketing is the cause of creating false wants and materialism, of which the industry benefits but not so much the customers.
1065	Businesses have also been accused of overselling private goods at the expense of public goods.
1066	Marketing also supposedly led to the creation of cultural pollution.
1067	Because of constant advertising, people’s minds are polluted with these messages.
1068	Marketing also has an impact on other businesses.
1069	There are three big problems involved: acquisition of competitors, marketing practices that create barriers to entry and unfair competitive marketing practices.
1070	Consumerism is an organised movement of citizens and government agencies to improve the rights and power of buyers in relation to sellers.
1071	Traditional seller rights include:.
1072	The right to introduce any product.
1073	The right to charge any price for a product, provided there is no discrimination.
1074	The right to send any amount on promotion, if it is not unfair.
1075	The right to use any product message, provided it is not misleading.
1076	The right to use buying incentive programmes, if they are not misleading.
1077	Traditional buyers rights include:.
1078	The right not buy a product that is offered for sale.
1079	The right to expect the product to be safe.
1080	The right to expect the product to perform as claimed.
1081	Consumer advocates also call for additional consumer rights:.
1082	The right to be well informed.
1083	The right to be protected against questionable products.
1084	The right to influence products and marketing practices in ways that improve quality of life.
1085	The right to consume in a way that will preserve the world for future generations.
1086	Environmentalism is an organised movement of concerned citizens and government agencies to protect and improve people’s current and future living environment.
1087	Modern environmentalists are not against marketing, but just want people and organisations to operate with more care for the environment.
1088	Environmental sustainability is a management approach that involves developing strategies that both sustain the environment and produce profits for the company.
1089	Environmental sustainability involves preserving the natural environment, while marketing sustainability involves both the natural and social environments.
1090	There are generally four forms of environmental sustainability.
1091	Pollution prevention: eliminating or reducing waste before creation.
1092	Product stewardship: minimising environmental impact throughout the entire life cycle process.
1093	New clean technology: developing new sets of environmental skills and capabilities.
1094	Sustainability vision: creating a strategic framework for future sustainability.
1095	In today’s world, environmental issues are high on the awareness list, but environmental policies still vary widely from country to country.
1096	Marketers must take responsibility for sustainable marketing.
1097	--- There are five sustainable marketing principles:.
1098	Consumer:oriented marketing: a principle of sustainable marketing that holds a company should view and organise its marketing activities from the consumer’s point of view.
1099	Customer value marketing: a principle of sustainable marketing that holds a company should put most of its resources into consumer value building marketing investments.
1100	Innovative marketing: a principle of sustainable marketing that requires a company to seek real product and marketing improvements.
1101	Sense:of:mission marketing: a principle of sustainable that holds a company should define its mission in broad social terms rather than narrow products terms.
1102	Societal marketing: a principle of sustainable marketing that holds a company should make marketing decisions by considering consumers’ wants, the company’s requirements, consumer’s long:term interests and society’s long term interests.
1103	--- Sustainable marketing calls for products that are not only pleasing, but also beneficial.
1104	Products can be classified according to their degree of satisfaction and long term benefit.
1105	Deficient products are products that have neither immediate appeal, nor long term benefits.
1106	Pleasing products are products that give high immediate satisfaction, but may damage the consumer in the long term.
1107	Salutary products are products that have low appeal but may benefit the consumers in the long term.
1108	Desirable products are products that give both high immediate satisfaction and high long:term benefits.
1109	Good ethics are important in sustainable marketing.
1110	Increasingly, companies are responding to need for guidelines of marketing ethics.
1111	Guidelines can’t resolve all the ethical decisions that firms must make, but there are some general principles that can be applied.
1112	Ethical norms for marketers include “do not harm”, “foster trust in the marketing system” and “embrace ethical values”.
1113	Ethical values include honesty, responsibility, fairness, respect, transparency and citizenship.
1114	The core of marketing is that firms will fulfil the needs of their customers.
1115	Sustainability goes beyond the needs of today’s customers, but means having concern for tomorrow’s customers as well.

20001	You’ve had your first flowering, no more.
20002	” Sansa had never felt less flowery.
20003	“My lady mother told me, but I.
20004	I thought it would be different.
20005	”Different how?”I don’t know.
20006	Less.
20007	less messy, and more magical.
20008	” Queen Cersei laughed.
20009	“Wait until you birth a child, Sansa.
20010	A woman’s life is nine parts mess to one part magic, you’ll learn that soon enough.
20011	and the parts that look like magic 404 often turn out to be messiest of all.
20012	” She took a sip of milk.
20013	“So now you are a woman.
20014	Do you have the least idea of what that means?”It means that I am now fit to be wedded and bedded,” said Sansa, “and to bear children for the king.
20015	” The queen gave a wry smile.
20016	“A prospect that no longer entices you as it once did, I can see.
20017	I will not fault you for that.
20018	Joffrey has always been difficult.
20019	Even his birth.
20020	I labored a day and a half to bring him forth.
20021	You cannot imagine the pain, Sansa.
20022	I screamed so loudly that I fancied Robert might hear me in the kingswood.
20023	”His Grace was not with you?”Robert? Robert was hunting.
20024	That was his custom.
20025	Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and hounds.
20026	When he returned he would present me with some pelts or a stag’s head, and I would present him with a baby.
20027	”Not that I wanted him to stay, mind you.
20028	I had Grand Maester Pycelle and an army of midwives, and I had my brother.
20029	When they told Jaime he was not allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which of them proposed to keep him out.
20030	”Joffrey will show you no such devotion, I fear.
20031	You could thank your sister for that, if she weren’t dead.
20032	He’s never been able to forget that day on the Trident when you saw her shame him, so he shames you in turn.
20033	You’re stronger than you seem, though.
20034	I expect you’ll survive a bit of humiliation.
20035	I did.
20036	You may never love the king, but you’ll love his children.
20037	”I love His Grace with all my heart,” Sansa said.
20038	The queen sighed.
20039	“You had best learn some new lies, and quickly.
20040	Lord Stannis will not like that one, I promise you.
20041	”The new High Septon said that the gods will never permit Lord Stannis to win, since Joffrey is the rightful king.
20042	” A half-smile flickered across the queen’s face.
20043	“Robert’s trueborn son and heir.
20044	Though Joff would cry whenever Robert picked him up.
20045	His Grace did not like that.
20046	His bastards had always gurgled at him happily, and sucked his finger when he put it in their little baseborn mouths.
20047	Robert wanted smiles and cheers, always, so he went where he found them, to his friends and his whores.
20048	Robert wanted to be loved.
20049	My brother Tyrion has the same disease.
20050	Do you want to be loved, Sansa?”Everyone wants to be loved.
20051	”I see flowering hasn’t made you any brighter,” said Cersei.
20052	“Sansa, permit me to share a bit of womanly wisdom with you on this very special day.
20053	Love is poison.
20054	A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill you all the same.
20055	” CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE JON It was dark in the Skirling Pass.
20056	The great stone flanks of the mountains hid the sun for most of the day, so they rode in shadow, the breath of man and horse steaming in the cold air.
20057	Icy fingers of water trickled down from the snowpack above into small frozen pools that cracked and broke beneath the hooves of their garrons.
20058	Sometimes they would see a few weeds struggling from some crack in the rock or a splotch of pale lichen, but there was no grass, and they were above the trees now.
20059	The track was as steep as it was narrow, wending its way ever upward.
20060	Where the pass was so constricted that rangers had to go single-file, Squire Dalbridge would take the lead, 405 scanning the heights as he went, his longbow ever close to hand.
20061	It was said he had the keenest eyes in the Night’s Watch.
20062	Ghost padded restlessly by Jon’s side.
20063	From time to time he would stop and turn, his ears pricked, as if he heard something behind them.
20064	Jon did not think the shadowcats would attack living men, not unless they were starving, but he loosened Longclaw in its scabbard even so.
20065	A wind-carved arch of grey stone marked the highest point of the pass.
20066	Here the way broadened as it began its long descent toward the valley of the Milkwater.
20067	Qhorin decreed that they would rest here until the shadows began to grow again.
20068	“Shadows are friends to men in black,” he said.
20069	Jon saw the sense of that.
20070	It would be pleasant to ride in the light for a time, to let the bright mountain sun soak through their cloaks and chase the chill from their bones, but they dared not.
20071	Where there were three watchers there might be others, waiting to sound the alarm.
20072	Stonesnake curled up under his ragged fur cloak and was asleep almost at once.
20073	Jon shared his salt beef with Ghost while Ebben and Squire Dalbridge fed the horses.
20074	Qhorin Halfhand sat with his back to a rock, honing the edge of his longsword with long slow strokes.
20075	Jon watched the ranger for a few moments, then summoned his courage and went to him.
20076	“My lord,” he said, “you never asked me how it went.
20077	With the girl.
20078	”I am no lord, Jon Snow.
20079	” Qhorin slid the stone smoothly along the steel with his twofingered hand.
20080	“She told me Mance would take me, if I ran with her.
20081	”She told you true.
20082	”She even claimed we were kin.
20083	She told me a story.
20084	”.
20085	of Bael the Bard and the rose of Winterfell.
20086	So Stonesnake told me.
20087	It happens I know the song.
20088	Mance would sing it of old, when he came back from a ranging.
20089	He had a passion for wildling music.
20090	Aye, and for their women as well.
20091	”You knew him?”We all knew him.
20092	” His voice was sad.
20093	They were friends as well as brothers, Jon realized, and now they are sworn foes.
20094	“Why did he desert?”For a wench, some say.
20095	For a crown, others would have it.
20096	” Qhorin tested the edge of his sword with the ball of his thumb.
20097	“He liked women, Mance did, and he was not a man whose knees bent easily, that’s true.
20098	But it was more than that.
20099	He loved the wild better than the Wall.
20100	It was in his blood.
20101	He was wildling born, taken as a child when some raiders were put to the sword.
20102	When he left the Shadow Tower he was only going home again.
20103	”Was he a good ranger?”He was the best of us,” said the Halfhand, “and the worst as well.
20104	Only fools like Thoren Smallwood despise the wildlings.
20105	They are as brave as we are, Jon.
20106	As strong, as quick, as clever.
20107	But they have no discipline.
20108	They name themselves the free folk, and each one thinks himself as good as a king and wiser than a maester.
20109	Mance was the same.
20110	He never learned how to obey.
20111	”No more than me,” said Jon quietly.
20112	Qhorin’s shrewd grey eyes seemed to see right through him.
20113	“So you let her go?” He did not sound the least surprised.
20114	“You know?”Now.
20115	Tell me why you spared her.
20116	” 406 It was hard to put into words.
20117	“My father never used a headsman.
20118	He said he owed it to the men he killed to look into their eyes and hear their last words.
20119	And when I looked into Ygritte’s eyes, I.
20120	” Jon stared down at his hands helplessly.
20121	“I know she was an enemy, but there was no evil in her.
20122	”No more than in the other two.
20123	”It was their lives or ours,” Jon said.
20124	“If they had seen us, if they had sounded that horn.
20125	”The wildlings would hunt us down and slay us, true enough.
20126	”Stonesnake has the horn now, though, and we took Ygritte’s knife and axe.
20127	She’s behind us, afoot, unarmed.
20128	”And not like to be a threat,” Qhorin agreed.
20129	“If I had needed her dead, I would have left her with Ebben, or done the thing myself.
20130	”Then why did you command it of me?”I did not command it.
20131	I told you to do what needed to be done, and left you to decide what that would be.
20132	” Qhorin stood and slid his longsword back into its scabbard.
20133	“When I want a mountain scaled, I call on Stonesnake.
20134	Should I need to put an arrow through the eye of some foe across a windy battlefield, I summon Squire Dalbridge.
20135	Ebben can make any man give up his secrets.
20136	To lead men you must know them, Jon Snow.
20137	I know more of you now than I did this morning.
20138	”And if I had slain her?” asked Jon.
20139	“She would be dead, and I would know you better than I had before.
20140	But enough talk.
20141	You ought be sleeping.
20142	We have leagues to go, and dangers to face.
20143	You will need your strength.
20144	” Jon did not think sleep would come easily, but he knew the Halfhand was right.
20145	He found a place out of the wind, beneath an overhang of rock, and took off his cloak to use it for a blanket.
20146	“Ghost,” he called.
20147	“Here.
20148	To me.
20149	” He always slept better with the great white wolf beside him:: there was comfort in the smell of him, and welcome warmth in that shaggy pale fur.
20150	This time, though, Ghost did no more than look at him.
20151	Then he turned away and padded around the garrons, and quick as that he was gone.
20152	He wants to hunt, Jon thought.
20153	Perhaps there were goats in these mountains.
20154	The shadowcats must live on something.
20155	“Just don’t try and bring down a ‘cat,” he muttered.
20156	Even for a direwolf, that would be dangerous.
20157	He tugged his cloak over him and stretched out beneath the rock.
20158	When he closed his eyes, he dreamed of direwolves.
20159	There were five of them when there should have been six, and they were scattered, each apart from the others.
20160	He felt a deep ache of emptiness, a sense of incompleteness.
20161	The forest was vast and cold, and they were so small, so lost.
20162	His brothers were out there somewhere, and his sister, but he had lost their scent.
20163	He sat on his haunches and lifted his head to the darkening sky, and his cry echoed through the forest, a long lonely mournful sound.
20164	As it died away, he pricked up his ears, listening for an answer, but the only sound was the sigh of blowing snow.
20165	Jon? The call came from behind him, softer than a whisper, but strong too.
20166	Can a shout be silent? He turned his head, searching for his brother, for a glimpse of a lean grey shape moving beneath the trees, but there was nothing, only.
20167	A weirwood.
20168	407 It seemed to sprout from solid rock, its pale roots twisting up from a myriad of fissures and hairline cracks.
20169	The tree was slender compared to other weirwoods he had seen, no more than a sapling, yet it was growing as he watched, its limbs thickening as they reached for the sky.
20170	Wary, he circled the smooth white trunk until he came to the face.
20171	Red eyes looked at him.
20172	Fierce eyes they were, yet glad to see him.
20173	The weirwood had his brother’s face.
20174	Had his brother always had three eyes? Not always, came the silent shout.
20175	Not before the crow.
20176	He sniffed at the bark, smelled wolf and tree and boy, but behind that there were other scents, the rich brown smell of warm earth and the hard grey smell of stone and something else, something terrible.
20177	Death, he knew.
20178	He was smelling death.
20179	He cringed back, his hair bristling, and bared his fangs.
20180	Don’t be afraid, I like it in the dark.
20181	No one can see you, but you can see them.
20182	But first you have to open your eyes.
20183	See? Like this.
20184	And the tree reached down and touched him.
20185	And suddenly he was back in the mountains, his paws sunk deep in a drift of snow as he stood upon the edge of a great precipice.
20186	Before him the Skirling Pass opened up into airy emptiness, and a long vee-shaped valley lay spread beneath him like a quilt, awash in all the colors of an autumn afternoon.
20187	A vast blue-white wall plugged one end of the vale, squeezing between the mountains as if it had shouldered them aside, and for a moment he thought he had dreamed himself back to Castle Black.
20188	Then he realized he was looking at a river of ice several thousand feet high.
20189	Under that glittering cold cliff was a great lake, its deep cobalt waters reflecting the snowcapped peaks that ringed it.
20190	There were men down in the valley, he saw now:: many men, thousands, a huge host.
20191	Some were tearing great holes in the half-frozen ground, while others trained for war.
20192	He watched as a swarming mass of riders charged a shield wall, astride horses no larger than ants.
20193	The sound of their mock battle was a rustling of steel leaves, drifting faintly on the wind.
20194	Their encampment had no plan to it:: he saw no ditches, no sharpened stakes, no neat rows of horse lines.
20195	Everywhere crude earthen shelters and hide tents sprouted haphazardly, like a pox on the face of the earth.
20196	He spied untidy mounds of hay, smelled goats and sheep, horses and pigs, dogs in great profusion.
20197	Tendrils of dark smoke rose from a thousand cookfires.
20198	This is no army, no more than it is a town.
20199	This is a whole people come together.
20200	Across the long lake, one of the mounds moved.
20201	He watched it more closely and saw that it was not dirt at all, but alive, a shaggy lumbering beast with a snake for a nose and tusks larger than those of the greatest boar that had ever lived.
20202	And the thing riding it was huge as well, and his shape was wrong, too thick in the leg and hips to be a man.
20203	Then a sudden gust of cold made his fur stand up, and the air thrilled to the sound of wings.
20204	As he lifted his eyes to the ice-white mountain heights above, a shadow plummeted out of the sky.
20205	A shrill scream split the air.
20206	He glimpsed blue-grey pinions spread wide, shutting out the sun.
20207	“Ghost!” Jon shouted, sitting up.
20208	He could still feel the talons, the pain.
20209	“Ghost, to me!” Ebben appeared, grabbed him, shook him.
20210	“Quiet! You mean to bring the wildlings down on us? What’s wrong with you, boy?”A dream,” said Jon feebly.
20211	“I was Ghost, I was on the edge of the mountain looking down on a frozen river, and something attacked me.
20212	A bird.
20213	an eagle, I think.
20214	” Squire Dalbridge smiled.
20215	“It’s always pretty women in my dreams.
20216	Would that I dreamed more often.
20217	” 408 Qhorin came up beside him.
20218	“A frozen river, you say?”The Milkwater flows from a great lake at the foot of a glacier,” Stonesnake put in.
20219	“There was a tree with my brother’s face.
20220	The wildlings.
20221	there were thousands, more than I ever knew existed.
20222	And giants riding mammoths.
20223	” From the way the light had shifted, Jon judged that he had been asleep for four or five hours.
20224	His head ached, and the back of his neck where the talons had burned through him.
20225	But that was in the dream.
20226	“Tell me all that you remember, from first to last,” said Qhorin Halfhand.
20227	Jon was confused.
20228	“It was only a dream.
20229	”A wolf dream,” the Halfhand said.
20230	“Craster told the Lord Commander that the wildlings were gathering at the source of the Milkwater.
20231	That may be why you dreamed it.
20232	Or it may be that you saw what waits for us, a few hours farther on.
20233	Tell me.
20234	” It made him feel half a fool to talk of such things to Qhorin and the other rangers, but he did as he was commanded.
20235	None of the black brothers laughed at him, however.
20236	By the time he was done, even Squire Dalbridge was no longer smiling.
20237	“Skinchanger?” said Ebben grimly, looking at the Halfhand.
20238	Does he mean the eagle? Jon wondered.
20239	Or me? Skinchangers and wargs belonged in Old Nan’s stories, not in the world he had lived in all his life.
20240	Yet here, in this strange bleak wilderness of rock and ice, it was not hard to believe.
20241	“The cold winds are rising.
20242	Mormont feared as much.
20243	Benjen Stark felt it as well.
20244	Dead men walk and the trees have eyes again.
20245	Why should we balk at wargs and giants?”Does this mean my dreams are true as well?” asked Squire Dalbridge.
20246	“Lord Snow can keep his mammoths, I want my women.
20247	”Man and boy I’ve served the Watch, and ranged as far as any,” said Ebben.
20248	“I’ve seen the bones of giants, and heard many a queer tale, but no more.
20249	I want to see them with my own eyes.
20250	”Be careful they don’t see you, Ebben,” Stonesnake said.
20251	Ghost did not reappear as they set out again.
20252	The shadows covered the floor of the pass by then, and the sun was sinking fast toward the jagged twin peaks of the huge mountain the rangers named Forktop.
20253	If the dream was true.
20254	Even the thought scared him.
20255	Could the eagle have hurt Ghost, or knocked him off the precipice? And what about the weirwood with his brother’s face, that smelled of death and darkness? The last ray of sun vanished behind the peaks of Forktop.
20256	Twilight filled the Skirling Pass.
20257	It seemed to grow colder almost at once.
20258	They were no longer climbing.
20259	In fact, the ground had begun to descend, though as yet not sharply.
20260	It was littered with cracks and broken boulders and tumbled heaps of rock.
20261	It will be dark soon, and still no sight of Ghost.
20262	It was tearing Jon apart, yet he dare not shout for the direwolf as he would have liked.
20263	Other things might be listening as well.
20264	“Qhorin,” Squire Dalbridge called softly.
20265	“There.
20266	Look.
20267	” The eagle was perched on a spine of rock far above them, outlined against the darkening sky.
20268	We’ve seen other eagles, Jon thought.
20269	That need not be the one I dreamed of.
20270	Even so, Ebben would have loosed a shaft at it, but the squire stopped him.
20271	“The bird’s well out of bowshot.
20272	”I don’t like it watching us.
20273	” The squire shrugged.
20274	“Nor me, but you won’t stop it.
20275	Only waste a good arrow.
20276	” 409 Qhorin sat in his saddle, studying the eagle for a long time.
20277	“We press on,” he finally said.
20278	The rangers resumed their descent.
20279	Ghost, Jon wanted to shout, where are you? He was about to follow Qhorin and the others when he glimpsed a flash of white between two boulders.
20280	A patch of old snow, he thought, until he saw it stir.
20281	He was off his horse at once.
20282	As he went to his knees, Ghost lifted his head.
20283	His neck glistened wetly, but he made no sound when Jon peeled off a glove and touched him.
20284	The talons had torn a bloody path through fur and flesh, but the bird had not been able to snap his neck.
20285	Qhorin Halfhand was standing over him.
20286	“How bad?” As if in answer, Ghost struggled to his feet.
20287	“The wolf is strong,” the ranger said.
20288	“Ebben, water.
20289	Stonesnake, your skin of wine.
20290	Hold him still, Jon.
20291	” Together they washed the caked blood from the direwolf’s fur.
20292	Ghost struggled and bared his teeth when Qhorin poured the wine into the ragged red gashes the eagle had left him, but Jon wrapped his arms around him and murmured soothing words, and soon enough the wolf quieted.
20293	By the time they’d ripped a strip from Jon’s cloak to wrap the wounds, full dark had settled.
20294	Only a dusting of stars set the black of sky apart from the black of stone.
20295	“Do we press on?” Stonesnake wanted to know.
20296	Qhorin went to his garron.
20297	“Back, not on.
20298	”Back?” Jon was taken by surprise.
20299	“Eagles have sharper eyes than men.
20300	We are seen.
20301	So now we run.
20302	” The Halfhand wound a long black scarf around his face and swung up into the saddle.
20303	The other rangers exchanged a look, but no man thought to argue.
20304	One by one they mounted and turned their mounts toward home.
20305	“Ghost, come,” he called, and the direwolf followed, a pale shadow moving through the night.
20306	All night they rode, feeling their way up the twisting pass and through the stretches of broken ground.
20307	The wind grew stronger.
20308	Sometimes it was so dark that they dismounted and went ahead on foot, each man leading his garron.
20309	Once Ebben suggested that some torches might serve them well, but Qhorin said, “No fire,” and that was the end of that.
20310	They reached the stone bridge at the summit and began to descend again.
20311	Off in the darkness a shadowcat screamed in fury, its voice bouncing off the rocks so it seemed as though a dozen other ‘cats were giving answer.
20312	Once Jon thought he saw a pair of glowing eyes on a ledge overhead, as big as harvest moons.
20313	In the black hour before dawn, they stopped to let the horses drink and fed them each a handful of oats and a twist or two of hay.
20314	“We are not far from the place the wildlings died,” said Qhorin.
20315	“From there, one man could hold a hundred.
20316	The right man.
20317	” He looked at Squire Dalbridge.
20318	The squire bowed his head.
20319	“Leave me as many arrows as you can spare, brothers.
20320	” He stroked his longbow.
20321	“And see my garron has an apple when you’re home.
20322	He’s earned it, poor beastie.
20323	” He’s staying to die, Jon realized.
20324	Qhorin clasped the squire’s forearm with a gloved hand.
20325	“If the eagle flies down for a look at you.
20326	”.
20327	he’ll sprout some new feathers.
20328	” 410 The last Jon saw of Squire Dalbridge was his back as he clambered up the narrow path to the heights.
20329	When dawn broke, Jon looked up into a cloudless sky and saw a speck moving through the blue.
20330	Ebben saw it too, and cursed, but Qhorin told him to be quiet.
20331	“Listen.
20332	” Jon held his breath, and heard it.
20333	Far away and behind them, the call of a hunting horn echoed against the mountains.
20334	“And now they come,” said Qhorin.
20335	CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR TYRION Pod dressed him for his ordeal in a plush velvet tunic of Lannister crimson and brought him his chain of office.
20336	Tyrion left it on the bedside table.
20337	His sister misliked being reminded that he was the King’s Hand, and he did not wish to inflame the relations between them any further.
20338	Varys caught up with him as he was crossing the yard.
20339	“My lord,” he said, a little out of breath.
20340	“You had best read this at once.
20341	” He held out a parchment in a soft white hand.
20342	“A report from the north.
20343	”Good news or bad?” Tyrion asked.
20344	“That is not for me to judge.
20345	” Tyrion unrolled the parchment.
20346	He had to squint to read the words in the torch-lit yard.
20347	“Gods be good,” he said softly.
20348	“Both of them?”I fear so, my lord.
20349	It is so sad.
20350	So grievous sad.
20351	And them so young and innocent.
20352	” Tyrion remembered how the wolves had howled when the Stark boy had fallen.
20353	Are they howling now, I wonder? “Have you told anyone else?” he asked.
20354	“Not as yet, though of course I must.
20355	” He rolled up the letter.
20356	“I’ll tell my sister.
20357	” He wanted to see how she took the news.
20358	He wanted that very much.
20359	The queen looked especially lovely that night.
20360	She wore a low-cut gown of deep green velvet that brought out the color of her eyes.
20361	Her golden hair tumbled across her bare shoulders, and around her waist was a woven belt studded with emeralds.
20362	Tyrion waited until he had been seated and served a cup of wine before thrusting the letter at her.
20363	He said not a word.
20364	Cersei blinked at him innocently and took the parchment from his hand.
20365	“I trust you’re pleased,” he said as she read.
20366	“You wanted the Stark boy dead, I believe.
20367	” Cersei made a sour face.
20368	“It was Jaime who threw him from that window, not me.
20369	For love, he said, as if that would please me.
20370	It was a stupid thing to do, and dangerous besides, but when did our sweet brother ever stop to think?”The boy saw you,” Tyrion pointed out.
20371	“He was a child.
20372	I could have frightened him into silence.
20373	” She looked at the letter thoughtfully.
20374	“Why must I suffer accusations every time some Stark stubs his toe? This was Greyjoy’s work, I had nothing to do with it.
20375	”Let us hope Lady Catelyn believes that.
20376	” Her eyes widened.
20377	“She wouldn’t—”—kill Jaime? Why not? What would you do if Joffrey and Tommen were murdered?” 411 “I still hold Sansa!” the queen declared.
20378	“We still hold Sansa,” he corrected her, “and we had best take good care of her.
20379	Now where is this supper you’ve promised me, sweet sister?” Cersei set a tasty table, that could not be denied.
20380	They started with a creamy chestnut soup, crusty hot bread, and greens dressed with apples and pine nuts.
20381	Then came lamprey pie, honeyed ham, buttered carrots, white beans and bacon, and roast swan stuffed with mushrooms and oysters.
20382	Tyrion was exceedingly courteous:: he offered his sister the choice portions of every dish, and made certain he ate only what she did.
20383	Not that he truly thought she’d poison him, but it never hurt to be careful.
20384	The news about the Starks had soured her, he could see.
20385	“We’ve had no word from Bitterbridge?” she asked anxiously as she speared a bit of apple on the point of her dagger and ate it with small, delicate bites.
20386	“None.
20387	”I’ve never trusted Littlefinger.
20388	For enough coin, he’d go over to Stannis in a heartbeat.
20389	”Stannis Baratheon is too bloody righteous to buy men.
20390	Nor would he make a comfortable lord for the likes of Petyr.
20391	This war has made for some queer bedfellows, I agree, but those two? No.
20392	” As he carved some slices off the ham, she said, “We have Lady Tanda to thank for the pig.
20393	”A token of her love?”A bribe.
20394	She begs leave to return to her castle.
20395	Your leave as well as mine.
20396	I suspect she fears you’ll arrest her on the road, as you did Lord Gyles.
20397	”Does she plan to make off with the heir to the throne?” Tyrion served his sister a cut of ham and took one for himself.
20398	“I’d sooner she remain.
20399	If she wants to feel safe, tell her to bring down her garrison from Stokeworth.
20400	As many men as she has.
20401	”If we need men so badly, why did you send away your savages?” A certain testiness crept into Cersei’s voice.
20402	“It was the best use I could have made of them,” he told her truthfully.
20403	“They’re fierce warriors, but not soldiers.
20404	In formal battle, discipline is more important than courage.
20405	They’ve already done us more good in the kingswood than they would ever have done us on the city walls.
20406	” As the swan was being served, the queen questioned him about the conspiracy of the Antler Men.
20407	She seemed more annoyed than afraid.
20408	“Why are we plagued with so many treasons? What injury has House Lannister ever done these wretches?”None,” said Tyrion, “but they think to be on the winning side.
20409	which makes them fools as well as traitors.
20410	”Are you certain you’ve found them all?”Varys says so.
20411	” The swan was too rich for his taste.
20412	A line appeared on Cersei’s pale white brow, between those lovely eyes.
20413	“You put too much trust in that eunuch.
20414	”He serves me well.
20415	”Or so he’d have you believe.
20416	You think you’re the only one he whispers secrets to? He gives each of us just enough to convince us that we’d be helpless without him.
20417	He played the same game with me, when I first wed Robert.
20418	For years, I was convinced I had no truer friend 412 at court, but now.
20419	” She studied his face for a moment.
20420	“He says you mean to take the Hound from Joffrey.
20421	” Damn Varys.
20422	“I need Clegane for more important duties.
20423	”Nothing is more important than the life of the king.
20424	”The life of the king is not at risk.
20425	Joff will have brave Ser Osmund guarding him, and Meryn Trant as well.
20426	” They’re good for nothing better.
20427	“I need Balon Swann and the Hound to lead sorties, to make certain Stannis gets no toehold on our side of the Blackwater.
20428	”Jaime would lead the sorties himself.
20429	”From Riverrun? That’s quite a sortie.
20430	”Joff’s only a boy.
20431	”A boy who wants to be part of this battle, and for once he’s showing some sense.
20432	I don’t intend to put him in the thick of the fighting, but he needs to be seen.
20433	Men fight more fiercely for a king who shares their peril than one who hides behind his mother’s skirts.
20434	”He’s thirteen, Tyrion.
20435	”Remember Jaime at thirteen? If you want the boy to be his father’s son, let him play the part.
20436	Joff wears the finest armor gold can buy, and he’ll have a dozen gold cloaks around him at all times.
20437	If the city looks to be in the least danger of falling, I’ll have him escorted back to the Red Keep at once.
20438	” He had thought that might reassure her, but he saw no sign of pleasure in those green eyes.
20439	“Will the city fall?”No.
20440	” But if it does, pray that we can hold the Red Keep long enough for our lord father to march to our relief.
20441	“You’ve lied to me before, Tyrion.
20442	”Always with good reason, sweet sister.
20443	I want amity between us as much as you do.
20444	I’ve decided to release Lord Gyles.
20445	” He had kept Gyles safe for just this gesture.
20446	“You can have Ser Boros Blount back as well.
20447	” The queen’s mouth tightened.
20448	“Ser Boros can rot at Rosby,” she said, “but Tommen—”—stays where he is.
20449	He’s safer under Lord Jacelyn’s protection than he would ever have been with Lord Gyles.
20450	” Serving men cleared away the swan, hardly touched.
20451	Cersei beckoned for the sweet.
20452	“I hope you like blackberry tarts.
20453	”I love all sorts of tarts.
20454	”Oh, I’ve known that a long while.
20455	Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?”Are we playing at riddles now? No.
20456	”He doesn’t have a cock.
20457	”Neither do you.
20458	” And don’t you just hate that, Cersei? “Perhaps I’m dangerous too.
20459	You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man.
20460	That worm between your legs does half your thinking.
20461	” Tyrion licked the crumbs off his fingers.
20462	He did not like his sister’s smile.
20463	“Yes, and just now my worm is thinking that perhaps it is time I took my leave.
20464	”Are you unwell, brother?” She leaned forward, giving him a good look at the top of her breasts.
20465	“Suddenly you appear somewhat flustered.
20466	” 413 “Flustered?” Tyrion glanced at the door.
20467	He thought he’d heard something outside.
20468	He was beginning to regret coming here alone.
20469	“You’ve never shown much interest in my cock before.
20470	”It’s not your cock that interests me, so much as what you stick it in.
20471	I don’t depend on the eunuch for everything, as you do.
20472	I have my own ways of finding out things.
20473	especially things that people don’t want me to know.
20474	”What are you trying to say?”Only this—I have your little whore.
20475	” Tyrion reached for his wine cup, buying a moment to gather his thoughts.
20476	“I thought men were more to your taste.
20477	”You’re such a droll little fellow.
20478	Tell me, have you married this one yet?” When he gave her no answer she laughed and said, “Father will be ever so relieved.
20479	” His belly felt as if it were full of eels.
20480	How had she found Shae? Had Varys betrayed him? Or had all his precautions been undone by his impatience the night he rode directly to the manse? “Why should you care who I choose to warm my bed?”A Lannister always pays his debts,” she said.
20481	“You’ve been scheming against me since the day you came to King’s Landing.
20482	You sold Myrcella, stole Tommen, and now you plot to have Joff killed.
20483	You want him dead so you can rule through Tommen.
20484	” Well, I can’t say the notion isn’t tempting.
20485	“This is madness, Cersei.
20486	Stannis will be here in days.
20487	You need me.
20488	”For what? Your great prowess in battle?”Bronn’s sellswords will never fight without me,” he lied.
20489	“Oh, I think they will.
20490	It’s your gold they love, not your impish wit.
20491	Have no fear, though, they won’t be without you.
20492	I won’t say I haven’t thought of slitting your throat from time to time, but Jaime would never forgive me if I did.
20493	”And the whore?” He would not call her by name.
20494	If I can convince her Shae means nothing to me, perhaps.
20495	“She’ll be treated gently enough, so long as no harm comes to my sons.
20496	If Joff should be killed, however, or if Tommen should fall into the hands of our enemies, your little cunt will die more painfully than you can possibly imagine.
20497	” She truly believes I mean to kill my own nephew.
20498	“The boys are safe,” he promised her wearily.
20499	“Gods be good, Cersei, they’re my own blood! What sort of man do you take me for?”A small and twisted one.
20500	” Tyrion stared at the dregs on the bottom of his wine cup.
20501	What would Jaime do in my place? Kill the bitch, most likely, and worry about the consequences afterward.
20502	But Tyrion did not have a golden sword, nor the skill to wield one.
20503	He loved his brother’s reckless wrath, but it was their lord father he must try and emulate.
20504	Stone, I must be stone, I must be Casterly Rock, hard and unmovable.
20505	If I fail this test, I had as lief seek out the nearest grotesquerie.
20506	“For all I know, you’ve killed her already,” he said.
20507	“Would you like to see her? I thought you might.
20508	” Cersei crossed the room and threw open the heavy oaken door.
20509	“Bring in my brother’s whore.
20510	” Ser Osmund’s brothers Osney and Osfryd were peas from the same pod, tall men with hooked noses, dark hair, and cruel smiles.
20511	She hung between them, eyes wide and white in her 414 dark face.
20512	Blood trickled from her broken lip, and he could see bruises through her torn clothing.
20513	Her hands were bound with rope, and they’d gagged her so she could not speak.
20514	“You said she wouldn’t be hurt.
20515	”She fought.
20516	” Unlike his brothers, Osney Kettleblack was clean-shaven, so the scratches showed plainly on his bare cheeks.
20517	“Got claws like a shadowcat, this one.
20518	”Bruises heal,” said Cersei in a bored tone.
20519	“The whore will live.
20520	So long as Joff does.
20521	” Tyrion wanted to laugh at her.
20522	It would have been so sweet, so very very sweet, but it would have given the game away.
20523	You’ve lost, Cersei, and the Kettleblacks are even bigger fools than Bronn claimed.
20524	All he needed to do was say the words.
20525	Instead he looked at the girl’s face and said, “You swear you’ll release her after the battle?”If you release Tommen, yes.
20526	” He pushed himself to his feet.
20527	“Keep her then, but keep her safe.
20528	If these animals think they can use her.
20529	well, sweet sister, let me point out that a scale tips two ways.
20530	” His tone was calm, flat, uncaring:: he’d reached for his father’s voice, and found it.
20531	“Whatever happens to her happens to Tommen as well, and that includes the beatings and rapes.
20532	” If she thinks me such a monster, I’ll play the part for her.
20533	Cersei had not expected that.
20534	“You would not dare.
20535	” Tyrion made himself smile, slow and cold.
20536	Green and black, his eyes laughed at her.
20537	“Dare? I’ll do it myself.
20538	” His sister’s hand flashed at his face, but he caught her wrist and bent it back until she cried out.
20539	Osfryd moved to her rescue.
20540	“One more step and I’ll break her arm,” the dwarf warned him.
20541	The man stopped.
20542	“You remember when I said you’d never hit me again, Cersei?” He shoved her to the floor and turned back to the Kettleblacks.
20543	“Untie her and remove that gag.
20544	” The rope had been so tight as to cut off the blood to her hands.
20545	She cried out in pain as the circulation returned.
20546	Tyrion massaged her fingers gently until feeling returned.
20547	“Sweetling,” he said, “you must be brave.
20548	I am sorry they hurt you.
20549	”I know you’ll free me, my lord.
20550	”I will,” he promised, and Alayaya bent over and kissed him on the brow.
20551	Her broken lips left a smear of blood on his forehead.
20552	A bloody kiss is more than I deserve, Tyrion thought.
20553	She would never have been hurt but for me.
20554	Her blood still marked him as he looked down at the queen.
20555	“I have never liked you, Cersei, but you were my own sister, so I never did you harm.
20556	You’ve ended that.
20557	I will hurt you for this.
20558	I don’t know how yet, but give me time.
20559	A day will come when you think yourself safe and happy, and suddenly your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth, and you’ll know the debt is paid.
20560	” In war, his father had told him once, the battle is over in the instant one army breaks and flees.
20561	No matter that they’re as numerous as they were a moment before, still armed and armored:: once they had run before you they would not turn to fight again.
20562	So it was with Cersei.
20563	“Get out!” was all the answer she could summon.
20564	“Get out of my sight!” Tyrion bowed.
20565	“Good night, then.
20566	And pleasant dreams.
20567	” He made his way back to the Tower of the Hand with a thousand armored feet marching through his skull.
20568	I ought to have seen this coming the first time I slipped through the back of Chataya’s wardrobe.
20569	Perhaps he had not wanted to see.
20570	His legs were aching badly by the 415 time he had made the climb.
20571	He sent Pod for a flagon of wine and pushed his way into his bedchamber.
20572	Shae sat cross-legged in the canopied bed, nude but for the heavy golden chain that looped across the swell of her breasts: a chain of linked golden hands, each clasping the next.
20573	Tyrion had not expected her.
20574	“What are you doing here?” Laughing, she stroked the chain.
20575	“I wanted some hands on my titties.
20576	but these little gold ones are cold.
20577	” For a moment he did know what to say.
20578	How could he tell her that another woman had taken the beating meant for her, and might well die in her place should some mischance of battle fell Joffrey? He wiped Alayaya’s blood from his brow with the heel of his hand.
20579	“The Lady Lollys—”She’s asleep.
20580	Sleep’s all she ever wants to do, the great cow.
20581	She sleeps and she eats.
20582	Sometimes she falls asleep while she’s eating.
20583	The food falls under the blankets and she rolls in it, and I have to clean her.
20584	” She made a disgusted face.
20585	“All they did was fuck her.
20586	”Her mother says she’s sick.
20587	”She has a baby in her belly, that’s all.
20588	” Tyrion gazed around the room.
20589	Everything seemed much as he left it.
20590	“How did you enter? Show me the hidden door.
20591	” She gave a shrug.
20592	“Lord Varys made me wear a hood.
20593	I couldn’t see, except.
20594	there was one place, I got a peep at the floor out the bottom of the hood.
20595	It was all tiles, you know, the kind that make a picture?”A mosaic?” Shae nodded.
20596	“They were colored red and black.
20597	I think the picture was a dragon.
20598	Otherwise, everything was dark.
20599	We went down a ladder and walked a long ways, until I was all twisted around.
20600	Once we stopped so he could unlock an iron gate.
20601	I brushed against it when we went through.
20602	The dragon was past the gate.
20603	Then we went up another ladder, with a tunnel at the top.
20604	I had to stoop, and I think Lord Varys was crawling.
20605	” Tyrion made a round of the bedchamber.
20606	One of the sconces looked loose.
20607	He stood on his toes and tried to turn it.
20608	It revolved slowly, scraping against the stone wall.
20609	When it was upside down, the stub of the candle fell out.
20610	The rushes scattered across the cold stone floor did not show any particular disturbance.
20611	“Doesn’t m’lord want to bed me?” asked Shae.
20612	“In a moment.
20613	” Tyrion threw open his wardrobe, shoved the clothing aside, and pushed against the rear panel.
20614	What worked for a whorehouse might work for a castle as well.
20615	but no, the wood was solid, unyielding.
20616	A stone beside the window seat drew his eye, but all his tugging and prodding went for naught.
20617	He returned to the bed frustrated and annoyed.
20618	Shae undid his laces and threw her arms around his neck.
20619	“Your shoulders feel as hard as rocks,” she murmured.
20620	“Hurry, I want to feel you inside me.
20621	” Yet as her legs locked around his waist, his manhood left him.
20622	When she felt him go soft, Shae slid down under the sheets and took him in her mouth, but even that could not rouse him.
20623	After a few moments he stopped her.
20624	“What’s wrong?” she asked.
20625	All the sweet innocence of the world was written there in the lines of her young face.
20626	Innocence? Fool, she’s a whore, Cersei was right, you think with your cock, fool, fool.
20627	“Just go to sleep, sweetling,” he urged, stroking her hair.
20628	Yet long after Shae had taken his advice, Tyrion himself still lay awake, his fingers cupped over one small breast as he listened to her breathing.
20629	416 CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE CATELYN The Great Hall of Riverrun was a lonely place for two to sit to supper.
20630	Deep shadows draped the walls.
20631	One of the torches had guttered out, leaving only three.
20632	Catelyn sat staring into her wine goblet.
20633	The vintage tasted thin and sour on her tongue.
20634	Brienne was across from her.
20635	Between them, her father’s high seat was as empty as the rest of the hall.
20636	Even the servants were gone.
20637	She had given them leave to join the celebration.
20638	The walls of the keep were thick, yet even so, they could hear the muffled sounds of revelry from the yard outside.
20639	Ser Desmond had brought twenty casks up from the cellars, and the smallfolk were celebrating Edmure’s imminent return and Robb’s conquest of the Crag by hoisting horns of nut-brown ale.
20640	I cannot blame them, Catelyn thought.
20641	They do not know.
20642	And if they did, why should they care? They never knew my sons.
20643	Never watched Bran climb with their hearts in their throats, pride and terror so mingled they seemed as one, never heard him laugh, never smiled to see Rickon trying so fiercely to be like his older brothers.
20644	She stared at the supper set before her: trout wrapped in bacon, salad of turnip greens and red fennel and sweetgrass, pease and onions and hot bread.
20645	Brienne was eating methodically, as if supper were another chore to be accomplished.
20646	I am become a sour woman, Catelyn thought.
20647	I take no joy in mead nor meat, and song and laughter have become suspicious strangers to me.
20648	I am a creature of grief and dust and bitter longings.
20649	There is an empty place within me where my heart was once.
20650	The sound of the other woman’s eating had become intolerable to her.
20651	“Brienne, I am no fit company.
20652	Go join the revels, if you would.
20653	Drink a horn of ale and dance to Rymund’s harping.
20654	”I am not made for revels, my lady.
20655	” Her big hands tore apart a heel of black bread.
20656	Brienne stared at the chunks as if she had forgotten what they were.
20657	“If you command it, I.
20658	” Catelyn could sense her discomfort.
20659	“I only thought you might enjoy happier company than mine.
20660	”I’m well content.
20661	” The girl used the bread to sop up some of the bacon grease the trout had been fried in.
20662	“There was another bird this morning.
20663	” Catelyn did not know why she said it.
20664	“The maester woke me at once.
20665	That was dutiful, but not kind.
20666	Not kind at all.
20667	” She had not meant to tell Brienne.
20668	No one knew but her and Maester Vyman, and she had meant to keep it that way until.
20669	until.
20670	Until what? Foolish woman, will holding it secret in your heart make it any less true? If you never tell, never speak of it, will it become only a dream, less than a dream, a nightmare half-remembered? Oh, if only the gods would be so good.
20671	“Is it news of King’s Landing?” asked Brienne.
20672	“Would that it was.
20673	The bird came from Castle Cerwyn, from Ser Rodrik, my castellan.
20674	” Dark wings, dark words.
20675	“He has gathered what power he could and is marching on Winterfell, to take the castle back.
20676	” How unimportant all that sounded now.
20677	“But he said.
20678	he wrote.
20679	he told me, he.
20680	”My lady, what is it? Is it some news of your sons?” 417 Such a simple question that was:: would that the answer could be as simple.
20681	When Catelyn tried to speak, the words caught in her throat.
20682	“I have no sons but Robb.
20683	” She managed those terrible words without a sob, and for that much she was glad.
20684	Brienne looked at her with horror.
20685	“My lady?”Bran and Rickon tried to escape, but were taken at a mill on the Acorn Water.
20686	Theon Greyjoy has mounted their heads on the walls of Winterfell.
20687	Theon Greyjoy, who ate at my table since he was a boy of ten.
20688	” I have said it, gods forgive me.
20689	I have said it and made it true.
20690	Brienne’s face was a watery blur.
20691	She reached across the table, but her fingers stopped short of Catelyn’s, as if the touch might be unwelcome.
20692	“I.
20693	there are no words, my lady.
20694	My good lady.
20695	Your sons, they.
20696	they’re with the gods now.
20697	”Are they?” Catelyn said sharply.
20698	“What god would let this happen? Rickon was only a baby.
20699	How could he deserve such a death? And Bran.
20700	when I left the north, he had not opened his eyes since his fall.
20701	I had to go before he woke.
20702	Now I can never return to him, or hear him laugh again.
20703	” She showed Brienne her palms, her fingers.
20704	“These scars.
20705	they sent a man to cut Bran’s throat as he lay sleeping.
20706	He would have died then, and me with him, but Bran’s wolf tore out the man’s throat.
20707	” That gave her a moment’s pause.
20708	“I suppose Theon killed the wolves too.
20709	He must have, elsewise.
20710	I was certain the boys would be safe so long as the direwolves were with them.
20711	Like Robb with his Grey Wind.
20712	But my daughters have no wolves now.
20713	” The abrupt shift of topic left Brienne bewildered.
20714	“Your daughters.
20715	”Sansa was a lady at three, always so courteous and eager to please.
20716	She loved nothing so well as tales of knightly valor.
20717	Men would say she had my look, but she will grow into a woman far more beautiful than I ever was, you can see that.
20718	I often sent away her maid so I could brush her hair myself.
20719	She had auburn hair, lighter than mine, and so thick and soft.
20720	the red in it would catch the light of the torches and shine like copper.
20721	”And Arya, well.
20722	Ned’s visitors would oft mistake her for a stableboy if they rode into the yard unannounced.
20723	Arya was a trial, it must be said.
20724	Half a boy and half a wolf pup.
20725	Forbid her anything and it became her heart’s desire.
20726	She had Ned’s long face, and brown hair that always looked as though a bird had been nesting in it.
20727	I despaired of ever making a lady of her.
20728	She collected scabs as other girls collect dolls, and would say anything that came into her head.
20729	I think she must be dead too.
20730	” When she said that, it felt as though a giant hand were squeezing her chest.
20731	“I want them all dead, Brienne.
20732	Theon Greyjoy first, then Jaime Lannister and Cersei and the Imp, every one, every one.
20733	But my girls.
20734	my girls will.
20735	”The queen.
20736	she has a little girl of her own,” Brienne said awkwardly.
20737	“And sons too, of an age with yours.
20738	When she hears, perhaps she.
20739	she may take pity, and.
20740	”Send my daughters back unharmed?” Catelyn smiled sadly.
20741	“There is a sweet innocence about you, child.
20742	I could wish.
20743	but no.
20744	Robb will avenge his brothers.
20745	Ice can kill as dead as fire.
20746	Ice was Ned’s greatsword.
20747	Valyrian steel, marked with the ripples of a thousand foldings, so sharp I feared to touch it.
20748	Robb’s blade is dull as a cudgel compared to Ice.
20749	It will not be easy for him to get Theon’s head off, I fear.
20750	The Starks do not use headsmen.
20751	Ned always said that the man who passes the sentence should swing the blade, though he never took any joy in the duty.
20752	But I would, oh, yes.
20753	” She stared at her scarred hands, opened and closed them, then slowly raised her eyes.
20754	“I’ve sent him wine.
20755	”Wine?” Brienne was lost.
20756	“Robb? Or.
20757	Theon Greyjoy?”The Kingslayer.
20758	” The ploy had served her well with Cleos Frey.
20759	I hope you’re thirsty, Jaime.
20760	I hope your throat is dry and tight.
20761	“I would like you to come with me.
20762	” 418 “I am yours to command, my lady.
20763	”Good.
20764	” Catelyn rose abruptly.
20765	“Stay, finish your meal in peace.
20766	I will send for you later.
20767	At midnight.
20768	”So late, my lady?”The dungeons are windowless.
20769	One hour is much like another down there, and for me, all hours are midnight.
20770	” Her footsteps rang hollowly when Catelyn left the hall.
20771	As she climbed to Lord Hoster’s solar, she could hear them outside, shouting, “Tully!” and “A cup! A cup to the brave young lord!” My father is not dead, she wanted to shout down at them.
20772	My sons are dead, but my father lives, damn you all, and he is your lord still.
20773	Lord Hoster was deep in sleep.
20774	“He had a cup of dreamwine not so long ago, my lady,” Maester Vyman said.
20775	“For the pain.
20776	He will not know you are here.
20777	”It makes no matter,” Catelyn said.
20778	He is more dead than alive, yet more alive than my poor sweet sons.
20779	“My lady, is there aught I might do for you? A sleeping draught, perhaps?”Thank you, Maester, but no.
20780	I will not sleep away my grief.
20781	Bran and Rickon deserve better from me.
20782	Go and join the celebration, I will sit with my father for a time.
20783	”As you will, my lady.
20784	” Vyman bowed and left her.
20785	Lord Hoster lay on his back, mouth open, his breath a faint whistling sigh.
20786	One hand hung over the edge of the mattress, a pale frail fleshless thing, but warm when she touched it.
20787	She slid her fingers through his and closed them.
20788	No matter how tightly I hold him, I cannot keep him here, she thought sadly.
20789	Let him go.
20790	Yet her fingers would not seem to unbend.
20791	“I have no one to talk with, Father,” she told him.
20792	“I pray, but the gods do not answer.
20793	” Lightly she kissed his hand.
20794	The skin was warm, blue veins branching like rivers beneath his pale translucent skin.
20795	Outside the greater rivers flowed, the Red Fork and the Tumblestone, and they would flow forever, but not so the rivers in her father’s hand.
20796	Too soon that current would grow still.
20797	“Last night I dreamed of that time Lysa and I got lost while riding back from Seagard.
20798	Do you remember? That strange fog came up and we fell behind the rest of the party.
20799	Everything was grey, and I could not see a foot past the nose of my horse.
20800	We lost the road.
20801	The branches of the trees were like long skinny arms reaching out to grab us as we passed.
20802	Lysa started to cry, and when I shouted the fog seemed to swallow the sound.
20803	But Petyr knew where we were, and he rode back and found us.
20804	”But there’s no one to find me now, is there? This time I have to find our own way, and it is hard, so hard.
20805	”I keep remembering the Stark words.
20806	Winter has come, Father.
20807	For me.
20808	For me.
20809	Robb must fight the Greyjoys now as well as the Lannisters, and for what? For a gold hat and an iron chair? Surely the land has bled enough.
20810	I want my girls back, I want Robb to lay down his sword and pick some homely daughter of Walder Frey to make him happy and give him sons.
20811	I want Bran and Rickon back, I want.
20812	” Catelyn hung her head.
20813	“I want,” she said once more, and then her words were gone.
20814	After a time the candle guttered and went out.
20815	Moonlight slanted between the slats of the shutters, laying pale silvery bars across her father’s face.
20816	She could hear the soft whisper of his labored breathing, the endless rush of waters, the faint chords of some love song drifting up from the yard, so sad and sweet.
20817	“I loved a maid as red as autumn,” Rymund sang, “with sunset in her hair.
20818	” 419 Catelyn never noticed when the singing ended.
20819	Hours had passed, yet it seemed only a heartbeat before Brienne was at the door.
20820	“My lady,” she announced softly.
20821	“Midnight has come.
20822	” Midnight has come, Father, she thought, and I must do my duty.
20823	She let go of his hand.
20824	The gaoler was a furtive little man with broken veins in his nose.
20825	They found him bent over a tankard of ale and the remains of a pigeon pie, more than a little drunk.
20826	He squinted at them suspiciously.
20827	“Begging your forgiveness, m’lady, but Lord Edmure says no one is to see the Kingslayer without a writing from him, with his seal upon it.
20828	”Lord Edmure? Has my father died, and no one told me?” The gaoler licked his lips.
20829	“No, m’lady, not as I knows.
20830	”You will open the cell, or you will come with me to Lord Hoster’s solar and tell him why you saw fit to defy me.
20831	” His eyes fell.
20832	“As m’lady says.
20833	” The keys were chained to the studded leather belt that girdled his waist.
20834	He muttered under his breath as he sorted through them, until he found the one that fit the door to the Kingslayer’s cell.
20835	“Go back to your ale and leave us,” she commanded.
20836	An oil lamp hung from a hook on the low ceiling.
20837	Catelyn took it down and turned up the flame.
20838	“Brienne, see that I am not disturbed.
20839	” Nodding, Brienne took up a position just outside the cell, her hand resting on the pommel of her sword.
20840	“My lady will call if she has need of me.
20841	” Catelyn shouldered aside the heavy wood-and-iron door and stepped into foul darkness.
20842	This was the bowels of Riverrun, and smelled the part.
20843	Old straw crackled underfoot.
20844	The walls were discolored with patches of niter.
20845	Through the stone, she could hear the faint rush of the Tumblestone.
20846	The lamplight revealed a pail overflowing with feces in one corner and a huddled shape in another.
20847	The flagon of wine stood beside the door, untouched.
20848	So much for that ploy.
20849	I ought to be thankful that the gaoler did not drink it himself, I suppose.
20850	Jaime raised his hands to cover his face, the chains around his wrists clanking.
20851	“Lady Stark,” he said, in a voice hoarse with disuse.
20852	“I fear I am in no condition to receive you.
20853	”Look at me, ser.
20854	”The light hurts my eyes.
20855	A moment, if you would.
20856	” Jaime Lannister had been allowed no razor since the night he was taken in the Whispering Wood, and a shaggy beard covered his face, once so like the queen’s.
20857	Glinting gold in the lamplight, the whiskers made him look like some great yellow beast, magnificent even in chains.
20858	His unwashed hair fell to his shoulders in ropes and tangles, the clothes were rotting on his body, his face was pale and wasted.
20859	and even so, the power and the beauty of the man were still apparent.
20860	“I see you had no taste for the wine I sent you.
20861	”Such sudden generosity seemed somewhat suspect.
20862	”I can have your head off any time I want.
20863	Why would I need to poison you?”Death by poison can seem natural.
20864	Harder to claim that my head simply fell off.
20865	” He squinted up from the floor, his cat-green eyes slowly becoming accustomed to the light.
20866	“I’d invite you to sit, but your brother has neglected to provide me a chair.
20867	”I can stand well enough.
20868	”Can you? You look terrible, I must say.
20869	Though perhaps it’s just the light in here.
20870	” He was fettered at wrist and ankle, each cuff chained to the others, so he could neither stand nor 420 lie comfortably.
20871	The ankle chains were bolted to the wall.
20872	“Are my bracelets heavy enough for you, or did you come to add a few more? I’ll rattle them prettily if you like.
20873	”You brought this on yourself,” she reminded him.
20874	“We granted you the comfort of a tower cell befitting your birth and station.
20875	You repaid us by trying to escape.
20876	”A cell is a cell.
20877	Some under Casterly Rock make this one seem a sunlit garden.
20878	One day perhaps I’ll show them to you.
20879	” If he is cowed, he hides it well, Catelyn thought.
20880	“A man chained hand and foot should keep a more courteous tongue in his mouth, ser.
20881	I did not come here to be threatened.
20882	”No? Then surely it was to have your pleasure of me? It’s said that widows grow weary of their empty beds.
20883	We of the Kingsguard vow never to wed, but I suppose I could still service you if that’s what you need.
20884	Pour us some of that wine and slip out of that gown and we’ll see if I’m up to it.
20885	” Catelyn stared down at him in revulsion.
20886	Was there ever a man as beautiful or as vile as this one? “If you said that in my son’s hearing, he would kill you for it.
20887	”Only so long as I was wearing these.
20888	” Jaime Lannister rattled his chains at her.
20889	“We both know the boy is afraid to face me in single combat.
20890	”My son may be young, but if you take him for a fool, you are sadly mistaken.
20891	and it seems to me that you were not so quick to make challenges when you had an army at your back.
20892	”Did the old Kings of Winter hide behind their mothers’ skirts as well?”I grow weary of this, ser.
20893	There are things I must know.
20894	”Why should I tell you anything?”To save your life.
20895	”You think I fear death?” That seemed to amuse him.
20896	“You should.
20897	Your crimes will have earned you a place of torment in the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just.
20898	”What gods are those, Lady Catelyn? The trees your husband prayed to? How well did they serve him when my sister took his head off?” Jaime gave a chuckle.
20899	“If there are gods, why is the world so full of pain and injustice?”Because of men like you.
20900	”There are no men like me.
20901	There’s only me.
20902	” There is nothing here but arrogance and pride, and the empty courage of a madman.
20903	I am wasting my breath with this one.
20904	If there was ever a spark of honor in him, it is long dead.
20905	“If you will not speak with me, so be it.
20906	Drink the wine or piss in it, ser, it makes no matter to me.
20907	” Her hand was at the door pull when he said, “Lady Stark.
20908	” She turned, waited.
20909	“Things go to rust in this damp,” Jaime went on.
20910	“Even a man’s courtesies.
20911	Stay, and you shall have your answers.
20912	for a price.
20913	” He has no shame.
20914	“Captives do not set prices.
20915	”Oh, you’ll find mine modest enough.
20916	Your turnkey tells me nothing but vile lies, and he cannot even keep them straight.
20917	One day he says Cersei has been flayed, and the next it’s my father.
20918	Answer my questions and I’ll answer yours.
20919	”Truthfully?” 421 “Oh, it’s truth you want? Be careful, my lady.
20920	Tyrion says that people often claim to hunger for truth, but seldom like the taste when it’s served up.
20921	”I am strong enough to hear anything you care to say.
20922	”As you will, then.
20923	But first, if you’d be so kind.
20924	the wine.
20925	My throat is raw.
20926	” Catelyn hung the lamp from the door and moved the cup and flagon closer.
20927	Jaime sloshed the wine around his mouth before he swallowed.
20928	“Sour and vile,” he said, “but it will do.
20929	” He put his back to the wall, drew his knees up to his chest, and stared at her.
20930	“Your first question, Lady Catelyn?” Not knowing how long this game might continue, Catelyn wasted no time.
20931	“Are you Joffrey’s father?”You would never ask unless you knew the answer.
20932	”I want it from your own lips.
20933	” He shrugged.
20934	“Joffrey is mine.
20935	As are the rest of Cersei’s brood, I suppose.
20936	”You admit to being your sister’s lover?”I’ve always loved my sister, and you owe me two answers.
20937	Do all my kin still live?”Ser Stafford Lannister was slain at Oxcross, I am told.
20938	” Jaime was unmoved.
20939	“Uncle Dolt, my sister called him.
20940	It’s Cersei and Tyrion who concern me.
20941	As well as my lord father.
20942	”They live, all three.
20943	” But not long, if the gods are good.
20944	Jaime drank some more wine.
20945	“Ask your next.
20946	” Catelyn wondered if he would dare answer her next question with anything but a lie.
20947	“How did my son Bran come to fall?”I flung him from a window.
20948	” The easy way he said it took her voice away for an instant.
20949	If I had a knife, I would kill him now, she thought, until she remembered the girls.
20950	Her throat constricted as she said, “You were a knight, sworn to defend the weak and innocent.
20951	”He was weak enough, but perhaps not so innocent.
20952	He was spying on us.
20953	”Bran would not spy.
20954	”Then blame those precious gods of yours, who brought the boy to our window and gave him a glimpse of something he was never meant to see.
20955	”Blame the gods?” she said, incredulous.
20956	“Yours was the hand that threw him.
20957	You meant for him to die.
20958	” His chains chinked softly.
20959	“I seldom fling children from towers to improve their health.
20960	Yes, I meant for him to die.
20961	”And when he did not, you knew your danger was worse than ever, so you gave your cat’s-paw a bag of silver to make certain Bran would never wake.
20962	”Did I now?” Jaime lifted his cup and took a long swallow.
20963	“I won’t deny we talked of it, but you were with the boy day and night, your maester and Lord Eddard attended him frequently, and there were guards, even those damned direwolves.
20964	it would have required cutting my way through half of Winterfell.
20965	And why bother, when the boy seemed like to die of his own accord?” 422 “If you lie to me, this session is at an end.
20966	” Catelyn held out her hands, to show him her fingers and palms.
20967	“The man who came to slit Bran’s throat gave me these scars.
20968	You swear you had no part in sending him?”On my honor as a Lannister.
20969	”Your honor as a Lannister is worth less than this.
20970	” She kicked over the waste pail.
20971	Foulsmelling brown ooze crept across the floor of the cell, soaking into the straw.
20972	Jaime Lannister backed away from the spill as far as his chains would allow.
20973	“I may indeed have shit for honor, I won’t deny it, but I have never yet hired anyone to do my killing.
20974	Believe what you will, Lady Stark, but if I had wanted your Bran dead I would have slain him myself.
20975	” Gods be merciful, he’s telling the truth.
20976	“If you did not send the killer, your sister did.
20977	”If so, I’d know.
20978	Cersei keeps no secrets from me.
20979	”Then it was the Imp.
20980	”Tyrion is as innocent as your Bran.
20981	He wasn’t climbing around outside of anyone’s window, spying.
20982	”Then why did the assassin have his dagger?”What dagger was this?”It was so long,” she said, holding her hands apart, “plain, but finely made, with a blade of Valyrian steel and a dragonbone hilt.
20983	Your brother won it from Lord Baelish at the tourney on Prince Joffrey’s name day.
20984	” Lannister poured, drank, poured, and stared into his wine cup.
20985	“This wine seems to be improving as I drink it.
20986	Imagine that.
20987	I seem to remember that dagger, now that you describe it.
20988	Won it, you say? How?”Wagering on you when you tilted against the Knight of Flowers.
20989	” Yet when she heard her own words Catelyn knew she had gotten it wrong.
20990	“No.
20991	was it the other way?”Tyrion always backed me in the lists,” Jaime said, “but that day Ser Loras unhorsed me.
20992	A mischance, I took the boy too lightly, but no matter.
20993	Whatever my brother wagered, he lost.
20994	but that dagger did change hands, I recall it now.
20995	Robert showed it to me that night at the feast.
20996	His Grace loved to salt my wounds, especially when drunk.
20997	And when was he not drunk?” Tyrion Lannister had said much the same thing as they rode through the Mountains of the Moon, Catelyn remembered.
20998	She had refused to believe him.
20999	Petyr had sworn otherwise, Petyr who had been almost a brother, Petyr who loved her so much he fought a duel for her hand.
21000	and yet if Jaime and Tyrion told the same tale, what did that mean? The brothers had not seen each other since departing Winterfell more than a year ago.
21001	“Are you trying to deceive me?” Somewhere there was a trap here.
21002	“I’ve admitted to shoving your precious urchin out a window, what would it gain me to lie about this knife?” He tossed down another cup of wine.
21003	“Believe what you will, I’m past caring what people say of me.
21004	And it’s my turn.
21005	Have Robert’s brothers taken the field?”They have.
21006	”Now there’s a niggardly response.
21007	Give me more than that, or your next answer will be as poor.
21008	”Stannis marches against King’s Landing,” she said grudgingly.
21009	“Renly is dead, murdered at Bitterbridge by his brother, through some black art I do not understand.
21010	” 423 “A pity,” Jaime said.
21011	“I rather liked Renly, though Stannis is quite another tale.
21012	What side have the Tyrells taken?”Renly, at first.
21013	Now, I could not say.
21014	”Your boy must be feeling lonely.
21015	”Robb was sixteen a few days past.
21016	a man grown, and a king.
21017	He’s won every battle he’s fought.
21018	The last word we had from him, he had taken the Crag from the Westerlings.
21019	”He hasn’t faced my father yet, has he?”When he does, he’ll defeat him.
21020	As he did you.
21021	”He took me unawares.
21022	A craven’s trick.
21023	”You dare talk of tricks? Your brother Tyrion sent us cutthroats in envoy’s garb, under a peace banner.
21024	”If it were one of your sons in this cell, wouldn’t his brothers do as much for him?” My son has no brothers, she thought, but she would not share her pain with a creature such as this.
21025	Jaime drank some more wine.
21026	“What’s a brother’s life when honor is at stake, eh?” Another sip.
21027	“Tyrion is clever enough to realize that your son will never consent to ransom me.
21028	” Catelyn could not deny it.
21029	“Robb’s bannermen would sooner see you dead.
21030	Rickard Karstark in particular.
21031	You slew two of his sons in the Whispering Wood.
21032	”The two with the white sunburst, were they?” Jaime gave a shrug.
21033	“If truth be told, it was your son that I was trying to slay.
21034	The others got in my way.
21035	I killed them in fair fight, in the heat of battle.
21036	Any other knight would have done the same.
21037	”How can you still count yourself a knight, when you have forsaken every vow you ever swore?” Jaime reached for the flagon to refill his cup.
21038	“So many vows.
21039	they make you swear and swear.
21040	Defend the king.
21041	Obey the king.
21042	Keep his secrets.
21043	Do his bidding.
21044	Your life for his.
21045	But obey your father.
21046	Love your sister.
21047	Protect the innocent.
21048	Defend the weak.
21049	Respect the gods.
21050	Obey the laws.
21051	It’s too much.
21052	No matter what you do, you’re forsaking one vow or the other.
21053	” He took a healthy swallow of wine and closed his eyes for an instant, leaning his head back against the patch of niter on the wall.
21054	“I was the youngest man ever to wear the white cloak.
21055	”And the youngest to betray all it stood for, Kingslayer.
21056	”Kingslayer,” he pronounced carefully.
21057	“And such a king he was!” He lifted his cup.
21058	“To Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
21059	And to the sword that opened his throat.
21060	A golden sword, don’t you know.
21061	Until his blood ran red down the blade.
21062	Those are the Lannister colors, red and gold.
21063	” As he laughed, she realized the wine had done its work:: Jaime had drained most of the flagon, and he was drunk.
21064	“Only a man like you would be proud of such an act.
21065	”I told you, there are no men like me.
21066	Answer me this, Lady Stark—did your Ned ever tell you the manner of his father’s death? Or his brother’s?”They strangled Brandon while his father watched, and then killed Lord Rickard as well.
21067	” An ugly tale, and sixteen years old.
21068	Why was he asking about it now? “Killed, yes, but how?”The cord or the axe, I suppose.
21069	” 424 Jaime took a swallow, wiped his mouth.
21070	“No doubt Ned wished to spare you.
21071	His sweet young bride, if not quite a maiden.
21072	Well, you wanted truth.
21073	Ask me.
21074	We made a bargain, I can deny you nothing.
21075	Ask.
21076	”Dead is dead.
21077	” I do not want to know this.
21078	“Brandon was different from his brother, wasn’t he? He had blood in his veins instead of cold water.
21079	More like me.
21080	”Brandon was nothing like you.
21081	”If you say so.
21082	You and he were to wed.
21083	”He was on his way to Riverrun when.
21084	” Strange, how telling it still made her throat grow tight, after all these years.
21085	“.
21086	when he heard about Lyanna, and went to King’s Landing instead.
21087	It was a rash thing to do.
21088	” She remembered how her own father had raged when the news had been brought to Riverrun.
21089	The gallant fool, was what he called Brandon.
21090	Jaime poured the last half-cup of wine.
21091	“He rode into the Red Keep with a few companions, shouting for Prince Rhaegar to come out and die.
21092	But Rhaegar wasn’t there.
21093	Aerys sent his guards to arrest them all for plotting his son’s murder.
21094	The others were lords’ sons too, it seems to me.
21095	”Ethan Glover was Brandon’s squire,” Catelyn said.
21096	“He was the only one to survive.
21097	The others were Jeffory Mallister, Kyle Royce, and Elbert Arryn, Jon Arryn’s nephew and heir.
21098	” It was queer how she still remembered the names, after so many years.
21099	“Aerys accused them of treason and summoned their fathers to court to answer the charge, with the sons as hostages.
21100	When they came, he had them murdered without trial.
21101	Fathers and sons both.
21102	”There were trials.
21103	Of a sort.
21104	Lord Rickard demanded trial by combat, and the king granted the request.
21105	Stark armored himself as for battle, thinking to duel one of the Kingsguard.
21106	Me, perhaps.
21107	Instead they took him to the throne room and suspended him from the rafters while two of Aerys’s pyromancers kindled a blaze beneath him.
21108	The king told him that fire was the champion of House Targaryen.
21109	So all Lord Rickard needed to do to prove himself innocent of treason was.
21110	well, not burn.
21111	”When the fire was blazing, Brandon was brought in.
21112	His hands were chained behind his back, and around his neck was a wet leathern cord attached to a device the king had brought from Tyrosh.
21113	His legs were left free, though, and his longsword was set down just beyond his reach.
21114	”The pyromancers roasted Lord Rickard slowly, banking and fanning that fire carefully to get a nice even heat.
21115	His cloak caught first, and then his surcoat, and soon he wore nothing but metal and ashes.
21116	Next he would start to cook, Aerys promised.
21117	unless his son could free him.
21118	Brandon tried, but the more he struggled, the tighter the cord constricted around his throat.
21119	In the end he strangled himself.
21120	”As for Lord Rickard, the steel of his breastplate turned cherry-red before the end, and his gold melted off his spurs and dripped down into the fire.
21121	I stood at the foot of the Iron Throne in my white armor and white cloak, filling my head with thoughts of Cersei.
21122	After, Gerold Hightower himself took me aside and said to me, ‘You swore a vow to guard the king, not to judge him.
21123	’ That was the White Bull, loyal to the end and a better man than me, all agree.
21124	”Aerys.
21125	” Catelyn could taste bile at the back of her throat.
21126	The story was so hideous she suspected it had to be true.
21127	“Aerys was mad, the whole realm knew it, but if you would have me believe you slew him to avenge Brandon Stark.
21128	” 425 “I made no such claim.
21129	The Starks were nothing to me.
21130	I will say, I think it passing odd that I am loved by one for a kindness I never did, and reviled by so many for my finest act.
21131	At Robert’s coronation, I was made to kneel at the royal feet beside Grand Maester Pycelle and Varys the eunuch, so that he might forgive us our crimes before he took us into his service.
21132	As for your Ned, he should have kissed the hand that slew Aerys, but he preferred to scorn the arse he found sitting on Robert’s throne.
21133	I think Ned Stark loved Robert better than he ever loved his brother or his father.
21134	or even you, my lady.
21135	He was never unfaithful to Robert, was he?” Jaime gave a drunken laugh.
21136	“Come, Lady Stark, don’t you find this all terribly amusing?”I find nothing about you amusing, Kingslayer.
21137	”That name again.
21138	I don’t think I’ll fuck you after all.
21139	Littlefinger had you first, didn’t he? I never eat off another man’s trencher.
21140	Besides, you’re not half so lovely as my sister.
21141	” His smile cut.
21142	“I’ve never lain with any woman but Cersei.
21143	In my own way, I have been truer than your Ned ever was.
21144	Poor old dead Ned.
21145	So who has shit for honor now, I ask you? What was the name of that bastard he fathered?” Catelyn took a step backward.
21146	“Brienne.
21147	”No, that wasn’t it.
21148	” Jaime Lannister upended the flagon.
21149	A trickle ran down onto his face, bright as blood.
21150	“Snow, that was the one.
21151	Such a white name.
21152	like the pretty cloaks they give us in the Kingsguard when we swear our pretty oaths.
21153	” Brienne pushed open the door and stepped inside the cell.
21154	“You called, my lady?”Give me your sword.
21155	” Catelyn held out her hand.
21156	CHAPTER FIFTY-SIX THEON The sky was a gloom of cloud, the woods dead and frozen.
21157	Roots grabbed at Theon’s feet as he ran, and bare branches lashed his face, leaving thin stripes of blood across his cheeks.
21158	He crashed through heedless, breathless, icicles flying to pieces before him.
21159	Mercy, he sobbed.
21160	From behind came a shuddering howl that curdled his blood.
21161	Mercy, mercy.
21162	When he glanced back over his shoulder he saw them coming, great wolves the size of horses with the heads of small children.
21163	Oh, mercy, mercy.
21164	Blood dripped from their mouths black as pitch, burning holes in the snow where it fell.
21165	Every stride brought them closer.
21166	Theon tried to run faster, but his legs would not obey.
21167	The trees all had faces, and they were laughing at him, laughing, and the howl came again.
21168	He could smell the hot breath of the beasts behind him, a stink of brimstone and corruption.
21169	They’re dead, dead, I saw them killed, he tried to shout, I saw their heads dipped in tar, but when he opened his mouth only a moan emerged, and then something touched him and he whirled, shouting.
21170	flailing for the dagger he kept by his bedside and managing only to knock it to the floor.
21171	Wex danced away from him.
21172	Reek stood behind the mute, his face lit from below by the candle he carried.
21173	“What?” Theon cried.
21174	Mercy.
21175	“What do you want? Why are you in my bedchamber? Why?”My lord prince,” said Reek, “your sister has come to Winterfell.
21176	You asked to be informed at once if she arrived.
21177	”Past time,” Theon muttered, pushing his fingers through his hair.
21178	He had begun to fear that Asha meant to leave him to his fate.
21179	Mercy.
21180	He glanced outside the window, where the first vague light of dawn was just brushing the towers of Winterfell.
21181	“Where is she?” 426 “Lorren took her and her men to the Great Hall to break their fast.
21182	Will you see her now?”Yes.
21183	” Theon pushed off the blankets.
21184	The fire had burned down to embers.
21185	“Wex, hot water.
21186	” He could not let Asha see him disheveled and soaked with sweat.
21187	Wolves with children’s faces.
21188	He shivered.
21189	“Close the shutters.
21190	” The bedchamber felt as cold as the dream forest had been.
21191	All his dreams had been cold of late, and each more hideous than the one before.
21192	Last night he had dreamed himself back in the mill again, on his knees dressing the dead.
21193	Their limbs were already stiffening, so they seemed to resist sullenly as he fumbled at them with half-frozen fingers, tugging up breeches and knotting laces, yanking fur-trimmed boots over hard unbending feet, buckling a studded leather belt around a waist no bigger than the span of his hands.
21194	“This was never what I wanted,” he told them as he worked.
21195	“They gave me no choice.
21196	” The corpses made no answer, but only grew colder and heavier.
21197	The night before, it had been the miller’s wife.
21198	Theon had forgotten her name, but he remembered her body, soft pillowy breasts and stretch marks on her belly, the way she clawed his back when he fucked her.
21199	Last night in his dream he had been in bed with her once again, but this time she had teeth above and below, and she tore out his throat even as she was gnawing off his manhood.
21200	It was madness.
21201	He’d seen her die too.
21202	Gelmarr had cut her down with one blow of his axe as she cried to Theon for mercy.
21203	Leave me, woman.
21204	It was him who killed you, not me.
21205	And he’s dead as well.
21206	At least Gelmarr did not haunt Theon’s sleep.
21207	The dream had receded by the time Wex returned with the water.
21208	Theon washed the sweat and sleep from his body and took his own good time dressing.
21209	Asha had let him wait long enough:: now it was her turn.
21210	He chose a satin tunic striped black and gold and a fine leather jerkin with silver studs.
21211	and only then remembered that his wretched sister put more stock in blades than beauty.
21212	Cursing, he tore off the clothes and dressed again, in felted black wool and ringmail.
21213	Around his waist he buckled sword and dagger, remembering the night she had humiliated him at his own father’s table.
21214	Her sweet suckling babe, yes.
21215	Well, I have a knife too, and know how to use it.
21216	Last of all, he donned his crown, a band of cold iron slim as a finger, set with heavy chunks of black diamond and nuggets of gold.
21217	It was misshapen and ugly, but there was no help for that.
21218	Mikken lay buried in the lichyard, and the new smith was capable of little more than nails and horseshoes.
21219	Theon consoled himself with the reminder that it was only a prince’s crown.
21220	He would have something much finer when he was crowned king.
21221	Outside his door, Reek waited with Urzen and Kromm.
21222	Theon fell in with them.
21223	These days, he took guards with him everywhere he went, even to the privy.
21224	Winterfell wanted him dead.
21225	The very night they had returned from Acorn Water, Gelmarr the Grim had tumbled down some steps and broken his back.
21226	The next day, Aggar turned up with his throat slit ear to ear.
21227	Gynir Rednose became so wary that he shunned wine, took to sleeping in byrnie, coif, and helm, and adopted the noisiest dog in the kennels to give him warning should anyone try to steal up on his sleeping place.
21228	All the same, one morning the castle woke to the sound of the little dog barking wildly.
21229	They found the pup racing around the well, and Rednose floating in it, drowned.
21230	He could not let the killings go unpunished.
21231	Farlen was as likely a suspect as any, so Theon sat in judgment, called him guilty, and condemned him to death.
21232	Even that went sour.
21233	As he knelt to the block, the kennelmaster said, “M’lord Eddard always did his own killings.
21234	” Theon had to take the axe himself or look a weakling.
21235	His hands were sweating, so the shaft twisted in his grip as he swung and the first blow landed between Farlen’s shoulders.
21236	It took three more cuts to hack through all that bone and muscle and sever the head from the body, 427 and afterward he was sick, remembering all the times they’d sat over a cup of mead talking of hounds and hunting.
21237	I had no choice, he wanted to scream at the corpse.
21238	The ironborn can’t keep secrets, they had to die, and someone had to take the blame for it.
21239	He only wished he had killed him cleaner.
21240	Ned Stark had never needed more than a single blow to take a man’s head.
21241	The killings stopped after Farlen’s death, but even so his men continued sullen and anxious.
21242	“They fear no foe in open battle,” Black Lorren told him, “but it is another thing to dwell among enemies, never knowing if the washerwoman means to kiss you or kill you, or whether the serving boy is filling your cup with ale or bale.
21243	We would do well to leave this place.
21244	”I am the Prince of Winterfell!” Theon had shouted.
21245	“This is my seat, no man will drive me from it.
21246	No, nor woman either!” Asha.
21247	It was her doing.
21248	My own sweet sister, may the Others bugger her with a sword.
21249	She wanted him dead, so she could steal his place as their father’s heir.
21250	That was why she had let him languish here, ignoring the urgent commands he had sent her.
21251	He found her in the high seat of the Starks, ripping a capon apart with her fingers.
21252	The hall rang with the voices of her men, sharing stories with Theon’s own as they drank together.
21253	They were so loud that his entrance went all but unnoticed.
21254	“Where are the rest?” he demanded of Reek.
21255	There were no more than fifty men at the trestle tables, most of them his.
21256	Winterfell’s Great Hall could have seated ten times the number.
21257	“This is the whole o’ the company, m’lord prince.
21258	”The whole—how many men did she bring?”Twenty, by my count.
21259	” Theon Greyjoy strode to where his sister was sprawled.
21260	Asha was laughing at something one of her men had said, but broke off at his approach.
21261	“Why, ‘tis the Prince of Winterfell.
21262	” She tossed a bone to one of the dogs sniffing about the hall.
21263	Under that hawk’s beak of a nose, her wide mouth twisted in a mocking grin.
21264	“Or is it Prince of Fools?”Envy ill becomes a maid.
21265	” Asha sucked grease from her fingers.
21266	A lock of black hair fell across her eyes.
21267	Her men were shouting for bread and bacon.
21268	They made a deal of noise, as few as they were.
21269	“Envy, Theon?”What else would you call it? With thirty men, I captured Winterfell in a night.
21270	You needed a thousand and a moon’s turn to take Deepwood Motte.
21271	”Well, I’m no great warrior like you, brother,” She quaffed half a horn of ale and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand.
21272	“I saw the heads above your gates.
21273	Tell me true, which one gave you the fiercest fight, the cripple or the babe?” Theon could feel the blood rushing to his face.
21274	He took no joy from those heads, no more than he had in displaying the headless bodies of the children before the castle.
21275	Old Nan stood with her soft toothless mouth opening and closing soundlessly, and Farlen threw himself at Theon, snarling like one of his hounds.
21276	Urzen and Cadwyl had to beat him senseless with the butts of their spears.
21277	How did I come to this? he remembered thinking as he stood over the fly-speckled bodies.
21278	Only Maester Luwin had the stomach to come near.
21279	Stone-faced, the small grey man had begged leave to sew the boys’ heads back onto their shoulders, so they might be laid in the crypts below with the other Stark dead.
21280	“No,” Theon had told him.
21281	“Not the crypts.
21282	” 428 “But why, my lord? Surely they cannot harm you now.
21283	It is where they belong.
21284	All the bones of the Starks—”I said no.
21285	” He needed the heads for the wall, but he had burned the headless bodies that very day, in all their finery.
21286	Afterward he had knelt amongst the bones and ashes to retrieve a slag of melted silver and cracked jet, all that remained of the wolf’s-head brooch that had once been Bran’s.
21287	He had it still.
21288	“I treated Bran and Rickon generously,” he told his sister.
21289	“They brought their fate on themselves.
21290	”As do we all, little brother.
21291	” His patience was at an end.
21292	“How do you expect me to hold Winterfell if you bring me only twenty men?”Ten,” Asha corrected.
21293	“The others return with me.
21294	You wouldn’t want your own sweet sister to brave the dangers of the wood without an escort, would you? There are direwolves prowling the dark.
21295	” She uncoiled from the great stone seat and rose to her feet.
21296	“Come, let us go somewhere we can speak more privily.
21297	” She was right, he knew, though it galled him that she would make that decision.
21298	I should never have come to the hall, he realized belatedly.
21299	I should have summoned her to me.
21300	It was too late for that now, however.
21301	Theon had no choice but to lead Asha to Ned Stark’s solar.
21302	There, before the ashes of a dead fire, he blurted, “Dagmer’s lost the fight at Torrhen’s Square—”The old castellan broke his shield wall, yes,” Asha said calmly.
21303	“What did you expect? This Ser Rodrik knows the land intimately, as the Cleftjaw does not, and many of the northmen were mounted.
21304	The ironborn lack the discipline to stand a charge of armored horse.
21305	Dagmer lives, be grateful for that much.
21306	He’s leading the survivors back toward the Stony Shore.
21307	” She knows more than I do, Theon realized.
21308	That only made him angrier.
21309	“The victory has given Leobald Tallhart the courage to come out from behind his walls and join Ser Rodrik.
21310	And I’ve had reports that Lord Manderly has sent a dozen barges upriver packed with knights, warhorses, and siege engines.
21311	The Umbers are gathering beyond the Last River as well.
21312	I’ll have an army at my gates before the moon turns, and you bring me only ten men?”I need not have brought you any.
21313	”I commanded you—”Father commanded me to take Deepwood Motte,” she snapped.
21314	“He said nothing of me having to rescue my little brother.
21315	”Bugger Deepwood,” he said.
21316	“It’s a wooden pisspot on a hill.
21317	Winterfell is the heart of the land, but how am I to hold it without a garrison?”You might have thought of that before you took it.
21318	Oh, it was cleverly done, I’ll grant you.
21319	If only you’d had the good sense to raze the castle and carry the two little princelings back to Pyke as hostages, you might have won the war in a stroke.
21320	”You’d like that, wouldn’t you? To see my prize reduced to ruins and ashes.
21321	”Your prize will be the doom of you.
21322	Krakens rise from the sea, Theon, or did you forget that during your years among the wolves? Our strength is in our longships.
21323	My wooden pisspot sits close enough to the sea for supplies and fresh men to reach me whenever they are needful.
21324	But Winterfell is hundreds of leagues inland, ringed by woods, hills, and hostile holdfasts and castles.
21325	And every man in a thousand leagues is your enemy now, make no 429 mistake.
21326	You made certain of that when you mounted those heads on your gatehouse.
21327	” Asha shook her head.
21328	“How could you be such a bloody fool? Children.
21329	”They defied me!” he shouted in her face.
21330	“And it was blood for blood besides, two sons of Eddard Stark to pay for Rodrik and Maron.
21331	” The words tumbled out heedlessly, but Theon knew at once that his father would approve.
21332	“I’ve laid my brothers’ ghosts to rest.
21333	”Our brothers,” Asha reminded him, with a half smile that suggested she took his talk of vengeance well salted.
21334	“Did you bring their ghosts from Pyke, brother? And here I thought they haunted only Father.
21335	”When has a maid ever understood a man’s need for revenge?” Even if his father did not appreciate the gift of Winterfell, he must approve of Theon avenging his brothers! Asha snorted back a laugh.
21336	“This Ser Rodrik may well feel the same manly need, did you think of that? You are blood of my blood, Theon, whatever else you may be.
21337	For the sake of the mother who bore us both, return to Deepwood Motte with me.
21338	Put Winterfell to the torch and fall back while you still can.
21339	”No.
21340	” Theon adjusted his crown.
21341	“I took this castle and I mean to hold it.
21342	” His sister looked at him a long time.
21343	“Then hold it you shall,” she said, “for the rest of your life.
21344	” She sighed.
21345	“I say it tastes like folly, but what would a shy maid know of such things?” At the door she gave him one last mocking smile.
21346	“You ought to know, that’s the ugliest crown I’ve ever laid eyes on.
21347	Did you make it yourself?” She left him fuming, and lingered no longer than was needful to feed and water her horses.
21348	Half the men she’d brought returned with her as threatened, riding out the same Hunter’s Gate that Bran and Rickon had used for their escape.
21349	Theon watched them go from atop the wall.
21350	As his sister vanished into the mists of the wolfswood he found himself wondering why he had not listened and gone with her.
21351	“Gone, has she?” Reek was at his elbow.
21352	Theon had not heard him approach, nor smelled him either.
21353	He could not think of anyone he wanted to see less.
21354	It made him uneasy to see the man walking around breathing, with what he knew.
21355	I should have had him killed after he did the others, he reflected, but the notion made him nervous.
21356	Unlikely as it seemed, Reek could read and write, and he was possessed of enough base cunning to have hidden an account of what they’d done.
21357	“M’lord prince, if you’ll pardon me saying, it’s not right for her to abandon you.
21358	And ten men, that won’t be near enough.
21359	”I am well aware of that,” Theon said.
21360	So was Asha.
21361	“Well, might be I could help you,” said Reek.
21362	“Give me a horse and bag o’ coin, and I could find you some good fellows.
21363	” Theon narrowed his eyes.
21364	“How many?”A hundred, might be.
21365	Two hundred.
21366	Maybe more.
21367	” He smiled, his pale eyes glinting.
21368	“I was born up north here.
21369	I know many a man, and many a man knows Reek.
21370	” Two hundred men were not an army, but you didn’t need thousands to hold a castle as strong as Winterfell.
21371	So long as they could learn which end of a spear did the killing, they might make all the difference.
21372	“Do as you say and you’ll not find me ungrateful.
21373	You can name your own reward.
21374	”Well, m’lord, I haven’t had no woman since I was with Lord Ramsay,” Reek said.
21375	“I’ve had my eye on that Palla, and I hear she’s already been had, so.
21376	” 430 He had gone too far with Reek to turn back now.
21377	“Two hundred men and she’s yours.
21378	But a man less and you can go back to fucking pigs.
21379	” Reek was gone before the sun went down, carrying a bag of Stark silver and the last of Theon’s hopes.
21380	Like as not, I’ll never see the wretch again, he thought bitterly, but even so the chance had to be taken.
21381	That night he dreamed of the feast Ned Stark had thrown when King Robert came to Winterfell.
21382	The hall rang with music and laughter, though the cold winds were rising outside.
21383	At first it was all wine and roast meat, and Theon was making japes and eyeing the serving girls and having himself a fine time.
21384	until he noticed that the room was growing darker.
21385	The music did not seem so jolly then:: he heard discords and strange silences, and notes that hung in the air bleeding.
21386	Suddenly the wine turned bitter in his mouth, and when he looked up from his cup he saw that he was dining with the dead.
21387	King Robert sat with his guts spilling out on the table from the great gash in his belly, and Lord Eddard was headless beside him.
21388	Corpses lined the benches below, grey-brown flesh sloughing off their bones as they raised their cups to toast, worms crawling in and out of the holes that were their eyes.
21389	He knew them, every one:: Jory Cassel and Fat Tom, Porther and Cayn and Hullen the master of horse, and all the others who had ridden south to King’s Landing never to return.
21390	Mikken and Chayle sat together, one dripping blood and the other water.
21391	Benfred Tallhart and his Wild Hares filled most of a table.
21392	The miller’s wife was there as well, and Farlen, even the wildling Theon had killed in the wolfswood the day he had saved Bran’s life.
21393	But there were others with faces he had never known in life, faces he had seen only in stone.
21394	The slim, sad girl who wore a crown of pale blue roses and a white gown spattered with gore could only be Lyanna.
21395	Her brother Brandon stood beside her, and their father Lord Rickard just behind.
21396	Along the walls figures half-seen moved through the shadows, pale shades with long grim faces.
21397	The sight of them sent fear shivering through Theon sharp as a knife.
21398	And then the tall doors opened with a crash, and a freezing gale blew down the hall, and Robb came walking out of the night.
21399	Grey Wind stalked beside, eyes burning, and man and wolf alike bled from half a hundred savage wounds.
21400	Theon woke with a scream, startling Wex so badly that the boy ran naked from the room.
21401	When his guards burst in with drawn swords, he ordered them to bring him the maester.
21402	By the time Luwin arrived rumpled and sleepy, a cup of wine had steadied Theon’s hands, and he was feeling ashamed of his panic.
21403	“A dream,” he muttered, “that was all it was.
21404	It meant nothing.
21405	”Nothing,” Luwin agreed solemnly.
21406	He left a sleeping draught, but Theon poured it down the privy shaft the moment he was gone.
21407	Luwin was a man as well as a maester, and the man had no love for him.
21408	He wants me to sleep, yes.
21409	to sleep and never wake.
21410	He’d like that as much as Asha would.
21411	He sent for Kyra, kicked shut the door, climbed on top of her, and fucked the wench with a fury he’d never known was in him, By the time he finished, she was sobbing, her neck and breasts covered with bruises and bite marks.
21412	Theon shoved her from the bed and threw her a blanket.
21413	“Get out.
21414	” Yet even then, he could not sleep.
21415	Come dawn, he dressed and went outside, to walk along the outer walls.
21416	A brisk autumn wind was swirling through the battlements.
21417	It reddened his cheeks and stung his eyes.
21418	He watched the forest go from grey to green below him as light filtered through the silent trees.
21419	On his left he could see tower-tops above the inner wall, their roofs gilded by the rising sun.
21420	The red leaves of the weirwood were a blaze of flame among the green.
21421	Ned Stark’s tree, he 431 thought, and Stark’s wood, Stark’s castle, Stark’s sword, Stark’s gods.
21422	This is their place, not mine.
21423	I am a Greyjoy of Pyke, born to paint a kraken on my shield and sail the great salt sea.
21424	I should have gone with Asha.
21425	On their iron spikes atop the gatehouse, the heads waited.
21426	Theon gazed at them silently while the wind tugged on his cloak with small ghostly hands.
21427	The miller’s boys had been of an age with Bran and Rickon, alike in size and coloring, and once Reek had flayed the skin from their faces and dipped their heads in tar, it was easy to see familiar features in those misshapen lumps of rotting flesh.
21428	People were such fools.
21429	If we’d said they were rams’ heads, they would have seen horns.
21430	CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN SANSA They had been singing in the sept all morning, since the first report of enemy sails had reached the castle.
21431	The sound of their voices mingled with the whicker of horses, the clank of steel, and the groaning hinges of the great bronze gates to make a strange and fearful music.
21432	In the sept they sing for the Mother’s mercy but on the walls it’s the Warrior they pray to, and all in silence.
21433	She remembered how Septa Mordane used to tell them that the Warrior and the Mother were only two faces of the same great god.
21434	But if there is only one, whose prayers will be heard? Ser Meryn Trant held the blood bay for Joffrey to mount.
21435	Boy and horse alike wore gilded mail and enameled crimson plate, with matching golden lions on their heads.
21436	The pale sunlight flashed off the golds and reds every time Joff moved.
21437	Bright, shining, and empty, Sansa thought.
21438	The Imp was mounted on a red stallion, armored more plainly than the king in battle gear that made him look like a little boy dressed up in his father’s clothes.
21439	But there was nothing childish about the battle-axe slung below his shield.
21440	Ser Mandon Moore rode at his side, white steel icy-bright.
21441	When Tyrion saw her he turned his horse her way.
21442	“Lady Sansa,” he called from the saddle, “surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor’s?”She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off.
21443	I mean to visit the sept as well, to pray.
21444	”I won’t ask for whom.
21445	” His mouth twisted oddly:: if that was a smile, it was the queerest she had ever seen.
21446	“This day may change all.
21447	For you as well as for House Lannister.
21448	I ought to have sent you off with Tommen, now that I think on it.
21449	Still, you should be safe enough in Maegor’s, so long as—”Sansa!” The boyish shout rang across the yard:: Joffrey had seen her.
21450	“Sansa, here!” He calls me as if he were calling a dog, she thought.
21451	“His Grace has need of you,” Tyrion Lannister observed.
21452	“We’ll talk again after the battle, if the gods permit.
21453	” Sansa threaded her way through the file of gold-cloaked spearmen as Joffrey beckoned her closer.
21454	“It will be battle soon, everyone says so.
21455	”May the gods have mercy on us all.
21456	”My uncle’s the one who will need mercy, but I won’t give him any.
21457	” Joffrey drew his sword.
21458	The pommel was a ruby cut in the shape of a heart, set between a lion’s jaws.
21459	Three fullers were deeply incised in the blade.
21460	“My new blade, Hearteater.
21461	” 432 He’d owned a sword named Lion’s Tooth once, Sansa remembered.
21462	Arya had taken it from him and thrown it in a river.
21463	I hope Stannis does the same with this one.
21464	“It is beautifully wrought, Your Grace.
21465	”Bless my steel with a kiss.
21466	” He extended the blade down to her.
21467	“Go on, kiss it.
21468	” He had never sounded more like a stupid little boy.
21469	Sansa touched her lips to the metal, thinking that she would kiss any number of swords sooner than Joffrey.
21470	The gesture seemed to please him, though.
21471	He sheathed the blade with a flourish.
21472	“You’ll kiss it again when I return, and taste my uncle’s blood.
21473	” Only if one of your Kingsguard kills him for you.
21474	Three of the White Swords would go with Joffrey and his uncle: Ser Meryn, Ser Mandon, and Ser Osmund Kettleblack.
21475	“Will you lead your knights into battle?” Sansa asked, hoping.
21476	“I would, but my uncle the Imp says my uncle Stannis will never cross the river.
21477	I’ll command the Three Whores, though.
21478	I’m going to see to the traitors myself.
21479	” The prospect made Joff smile.
21480	His plump pink lips always made him look pouty.
21481	Sansa had liked that once, but now it made her sick.
21482	“They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest,” she said recklessly.
21483	“Though he’s older than Your Grace, to be sure.
21484	A man grown.
21485	” That made him frown.
21486	“I’ll deal with your brother after I’m done with my traitor uncle.
21487	I’ll gut him with Hearteater, you’ll see.
21488	” He wheeled his horse about and spurred toward the gate.
21489	Ser Meryn and Ser Osmund fell in to his right and left, the gold cloaks following four abreast.
21490	The Imp and Ser Mandon Moore brought up the rear.
21491	The guards saw them off with shouts and cheers.
21492	When the last was gone, a sudden stillness settled over the yard, like the hush before a storm.
21493	Through the quiet, the singing pulled at her.
21494	Sansa turned toward the sept.
21495	Two stableboys followed, and one of the guards whose watch was ended.
21496	Others fell in behind them.
21497	Sansa had never seen the sept so crowded, nor so brightly lit:: great shafts of rainbowcolored sunlight slanted down through the crystals in the high windows, and candles burned on every side, their little flames twinkling like stars.
21498	The Mother’s altar and the Warrior’s swam in light, but Smith and Crone and Maid and Father had their worshipers as well, and there were even a few flames dancing below the Stranger’s half-human face.
21499	for what was Stannis Baratheon, if not the Stranger come to judge them? Sansa visited each of the Seven in turn, lighting a candle at each altar, and then found herself a place on the benches between a wizened old washer woman and a boy no older than Rickon, dressed in the fine linen tunic of a knight’s son.
21500	The old woman’s hand was bony and hard with callus, the boy’s small and soft, but it was good to have someone to hold on to.
21501	The air was hot and heavy, smelling of incense and sweat, crystal-kissed and candle-bright:: it made her dizzy to breathe it.
21502	She knew the hymn:: her mother had taught it to her once, a long time ago in Winterfell.
21503	She joined her voice to theirs.
21504	Gentle Mother, font of mercy, save our sons from war, we pray, stay the swords and stay the arrows, let them know a better day.
21505	Gentle Mother, strength of women, help our daughters through this fray, soothe the wrath and tame the fury, teach us all a kinder way.
21506	433 Across the city, thousands had jammed into the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya’s Hill, and they would be singing too, their voices swelling out over the city, across the river, and up into the sky.
21507	Surely the gods must hear us, she thought.
21508	Sansa knew most of the hymns, and followed along on those she did not know as best she could.
21509	She sang along with grizzled old serving men and anxious young wives, with serving girls and soldiers, cooks and falconers, knights and knaves, squires and spit boys and nursing mothers.
21510	She sang with those inside the castle walls and those without, sang with all the city.
21511	She sang for mercy, for the living and the dead alike, for Bran and Rickon and Robb, for her sister Arya and her bastard brother Jon Snow, away off on the Wall.
21512	She sang for her mother and her father, for her grandfather Lord Hoster and her uncle Edmure Tully, for her friend Jeyne Poole, for old drunken King Robert, for Septa Mordane and Ser Dontos and Jory Cassel and Maester Luwin, for all the brave knights and soldiers who would die today, and for the children and the wives who would mourn them, and finally, toward the end, she even sang for Tyrion the Imp and for the Hound.
21513	He is no true knight but he saved me all the same, she told the Mother.
21514	Save him if you can, and gentle the rage inside him.
21515	But when the septon climbed on high and called upon the gods to protect and defend their true and noble king, Sansa got to her feet.
21516	The aisles were jammed with people.
21517	She had to shoulder through while the septon called upon the Smith to lend strength to Joffrey’s sword and shield, the Warrior to give him courage, the Father to defend him in his need.
21518	Let his sword break and his shield shatter, Sansa thought coldly as she shoved out through the doors, let his courage fail him and every man desert him.
21519	A few guards paced along on the gatehouse battlements, but otherwise the castle seemed empty.
21520	Sansa stopped and listened.
21521	A way off, she could hear the sounds of battle.
21522	The singing almost drowned them out, but the sounds were there if you had the ears to hear: the deep moan of warhorns, the creak and thud of catapults flinging stones, the splashes and splinterings, the crackle of burning pitch and thrum of scorpions loosing their yard-long ironheaded shafts.
21523	and beneath it all, the cries of dying men.
21524	It was another sort of song, a terrible song.
21525	Sansa pulled the hood of her cloak up over her ears, and hurried toward Maegor’s Holdfast, the castle-within-a-castle where the queen had promised they would all be safe.
21526	At the foot of the drawbridge, she came upon Lady Tanda and her two daughters.
21527	Falyse had arrived yesterday from Castle Stokeworth with a small troop of soldiers.
21528	She was trying to coax her sister onto the bridge, but Lollys clung to her maid, sobbing, “I don’t want to, I don’t want to, I don’t want to.
21529	”The battle is begun,” Lady Tanda said in a brittle voice.
21530	“I don’t want to, I don’t want to.
21531	” There was no way Sansa could avoid them.
21532	She greeted them courteously.
21533	“May I be of help?” Lady Tanda flushed with shame.
21534	“No, my lady, but we thank you kindly.
21535	You must forgive my daughter, she has not been well.
21536	”I don’t want to.
21537	” Lollys clutched at her maid, a slender, pretty girl with short dark hair who looked as though she wanted nothing so much as to shove her mistress into the dry moat, onto those iron spikes.
21538	“Please, please, I don’t want to.
21539	” Sansa spoke to her gently.
21540	“We’ll all be thrice protected inside, and there’s to be food and drink and song as well.
21541	” Lollys gaped at her, mouth open.
21542	She had dull brown eyes that always seemed to be wet with tears.
21543	“I don’t want to.
21544	” 434 “You have to,” her sister Falyse said sharply, “and that is the end of it.
21545	Shae, help me.
21546	” They each took an elbow, and together half dragged and half carried Lollys across the bridge.
21547	Sansa followed with their mother.
21548	“She’s been sick,” Lady Tanda said.
21549	If a babe can be termed a sickness, Sansa thought.
21550	It was common gossip that Lollys was with child.
21551	The two guards at the door wore the lion-crested helms and crimson cloaks of House Lannister, but Sansa knew they were only dressed-up sellswords.
21552	Another sat at the foot of the stair—a real guard would have been standing, not sitting on a step with his halberd across his knees—but he rose when he saw them and opened the door to usher them inside.
21553	The Queen’s Ballroom was not a tenth the size of the castle’s Great Hall, only half as big as the Small Hall in the Tower of the Hand, but it could still seat a hundred, and it made up in grace what it lacked in space.
21554	Beaten silver mirrors backed every wall sconce, so the torches burned twice as bright:: the walls were paneled in richly carved wood, and sweet-smelling rushes covered the floors.
21555	From the gallery above drifted down the merry strains of pipes and fiddle.
21556	A line of arched windows ran along the south wall, but they had been closed off with heavy draperies.
21557	Thick velvet hangings admitted no thread of light, and would muffle the sound of prayer and war alike.
21558	It makes no matter, Sansa thought.
21559	The war is with us.
21560	Almost every highborn woman in the city sat at the long trestle tables, along with a handful of old men and young boys.
21561	The women were wives, daughters, mothers, and sisters.
21562	Their men had gone out to fight Lord Stannis.
21563	Many would not return.
21564	The air was heavy with the knowledge.
21565	As Joffrey’s betrothed, Sansa had the seat of honor on the queen’s right hand.
21566	She was climbing the dais when she saw the man standing in the shadows by the back wall.
21567	He wore a long hauberk of oiled black mail, and held his sword before him: her father’s greatsword, Ice, near as tall as he was.
21568	Its point rested on the floor, and his hard bony fingers curled around the cross-guard on either side of the grip.
21569	Sansa’s breath caught in her throat.
21570	Ser Ilyn Payne seemed to sense her stare.
21571	He turned his gaunt, pox-ravaged face toward her.
21572	“What is he doing here?” she asked Osfryd Kettleblack.
21573	He captained the queen’s new red-cloak guard.
21574	Osfryd grinned.
21575	“Her Grace expects she’ll have need of him before the night’s done.
21576	” Ser Ilyn was the King’s Justice.
21577	There was only one service he might be needed for.
21578	Whose head does she want? “All rise for Her Grace, Cersei of House Lannister, Queen Regent and Protector of the Realm,” the royal steward cried.
21579	Cersei’s gown was snowy linen, white as the cloaks of the Kingsguard.
21580	Her long dagged sleeves showed a lining of gold satin.
21581	Masses of bright yellow hair tumbled to her bare shoulders in thick curls.
21582	Around her slender neck hung a rope of diamonds and emeralds.
21583	The white made her look strangely innocent, almost maidenly, but there were points of color on her cheeks.
21584	“Be seated,” the queen said when she had taken her place on the dais, “and be welcome.
21585	” Osfryd Kettleblack held her chair:: a page performed the same service for Sansa.
21586	“You look pale, Sansa,” Cersei observed.
21587	“Is your red flower still blooming?”Yes.
21588	”How apt.
21589	The men will bleed out there, and you in here.
21590	” The queen signaled for the first course to be served.
21591	“Why is Ser Ilyn here?” Sansa blurted out.
21592	435 The queen glanced at the mute headsman.
21593	“To deal with treason, and to defend us if need be.
21594	He was a knight before he was a headsman.
21595	” She pointed her spoon toward the end of the hall, where the tall wooden doors had been closed and barred.
21596	“When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad of him.
21597	” I would be gladder if it were the Hound, Sansa thought.
21598	Harsh as he was, she did not believe Sandor Clegane would let any harm come to her.
21599	“Won’t your guards protect us?”And who will protect us from my guards?” The queen gave Osfryd a sideways look.
21600	“Loyal sellswords are rare as virgin whores.
21601	If the battle is lost my guards will trip on those crimson cloaks in their haste to rip them off.
21602	They’ll steal what they can and flee, along with the serving men, washer women, and stableboys, all out to save their own worthless hides.
21603	Do you have any notion what happens when a city is sacked, Sansa? No, you wouldn’t, would you? All you know of life you learned from singers, and there’s such a dearth of good sacking songs.
21604	”True knights would never harm women and children.
21605	” The words rang hollow in her ears even as she said them.
21606	“True knights.
21607	” The queen seemed to find that wonderfully amusing.
21608	“No doubt you’re right.
21609	So why don’t you just eat your broth like a good girl and wait for Symeon Star-Eyes and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight to come rescue you, sweetling.
21610	I’m sure it won’t be very long now.
21611	” CHAPTER FIFTY-EIGHT DAVOS Blackwater Bay was rough and choppy, whitecaps everywhere.
21612	Black Betha rode the flood tide, her sail cracking and snapping at each shift of wind.
21613	Wraith and Lady Marya sailed beside her, no more than twenty yards between their hulls.
21614	His sons could keep a line.
21615	Davos took pride in that.
21616	Across the sea warhorns boomed, deep throaty moans like the calls of monstrous serpents, repeated ship to ship.
21617	“Bring down the sail,” Davos commanded.
21618	“Lower mast.
21619	Oarsmen to your oars.
21620	” His son Matthos relayed the commands.
21621	The deck of Black Betha churned as crewmen ran to their tasks, pushing through the soldiers who always seemed to be in the way no matter where they stood.
21622	Ser Imry had decreed that they would enter the river on oars alone, so as not to expose their sails to the scorpions and spitfires on the walls of King’s Landing.
21623	Davos could make out Fury well to the southeast, her sails shimmering golden as they came down, the crowned stag of Baratheon blazoned on the canvas.
21624	From her decks Stannis Baratheon had commanded the assault on Dragonstone sixteen years before, but this time he had chosen to ride with his army, trusting Fury and the command of his fleet to his wife’s brother Ser Imry, who’d come over to his cause at Storm’s End with Lord Alester and all the other Florents.
21625	Davos knew Fury as well as he knew his own ships.
21626	Above her three hundred oars was a deck given over wholly to scorpions, and topside she mounted catapults fore and aft, large enough to fling barrels of burning pitch.
21627	A most formidable ship, and very swift as well, although Ser Imry had packed her bow to stern with armored knights and men-at-arms, at some cost to her speed.
21628	The warhorns sounded again, commands drifting back from the Fury.
21629	Davos felt a tingle in his missing fingertips.
21630	“Out oars,” he shouted.
21631	“Form line.
21632	” A hundred blades dipped down 436 into the water as the oarmaster’s drum began to boom.
21633	The sound was like the beating of a great slow heart, and the oars moved at every stroke, a hundred men pulling as one.
21634	Wooden wings had sprouted from the Wraith and Lady Marya as well.
21635	The three galleys kept pace, their blades churning the water.
21636	“Slow cruise,” Davos called.
21637	Lord Velaryon’s silver-hulled Pride of Driftmark had moved into her position to port of Wraith, and Bold Laughter was coming up fast, but Harridan was only now getting her oars into the water and Seahorse was still struggling to bring down her mast.
21638	Davos looked astern.
21639	Yes, there, far to the south, that could only be Swordfish, lagging as ever.
21640	She dipped two hundred oars and mounted the largest ram in the fleet, though Davos had grave doubts about her captain.
21641	He could hear soldiers shouting encouragement to each other across the water.
21642	They’d been little more than ballast since Storm’s End, and were eager to get at the foe, confident of victory.
21643	In that, they were of one mind with their admiral, Lord High Captain Ser Imry Florent.
21644	Three days past, he had summoned all his captains to a war council aboard the Fury while the fleet lay anchored at the mouth of the Wendwater, in order to acquaint them with his dispositions.
21645	Davos and his sons had been assigned a place in the second line of battle, well out on the dangerous starboard wing.
21646	“A place of honor,” Allard had declared, well satisfied with the chance to prove his valor.
21647	“A place of peril,” his father had pointed out.
21648	His sons had given him pitying looks, even young Maric.
21649	The Onion Knight has become an old woman, he could hear them thinking, still a smuggler at heart.
21650	Well, the last was true enough, he would make no apologies for it.
21651	Seaworth had a lordly ring to it, but down deep he was still Davos of Flea Bottom, coming home to his city on its three high hills.
21652	He knew as much of ships and sails and shores as any man in the Seven Kingdoms, and had fought his share of desperate fights sword to sword on a wet deck.
21653	But to this sort of battle he came a maiden, nervous and afraid.
21654	Smugglers do not sound warhorns and raise banners.
21655	When they smell danger, they raise sail and run before the wind.
21656	Had he been admiral, he might have done it all differently.
21657	For a start, he would have sent a few of his swiftest ships to probe upriver and see what awaited them, instead of smashing in headlong.
21658	When he had suggested as much to Ser Imry, the Lord High Captain had thanked him courteously, but his eyes were not as polite.
21659	Who is this lowborn craven? those eyes asked.
21660	Is he the one who bought his knighthood with an onion? With four times as many ships as the boy king, Ser Imry saw no need for caution or deceptive tactics.
21661	He had organized the fleet into ten lines of battle, each of twenty ships.
21662	The first two lines would sweep up the river to engage and destroy Joffrey’s little fleet, or “the boy’s toys” as Ser Imry dubbed them, to the mirth of his lordly captains.
21663	Those that followed would land companies of archers and spearmen beneath the city walls, and only then join the fight on the river.
21664	The smaller, slower ships to the rear would ferry over the main part of Stannis’s host from the south bank, protected by Salladhor Saan and his Lyseni, who would stand out in the bay in case the Lannisters had other ships hidden up along the coast, poised to sweep down on their rear.
21665	To be fair, there was reason for Ser Imry’s haste.
21666	The winds had not used them kindly on the voyage up from Storm’s End.
21667	They had lost two cogs to the rocks of Shipbreaker Bay on the very day they set sail, a poor way to begin.
21668	One of the Myrish galleys had foundered in the Straits of Tarth, and a storm had overtaken them as they were entering the Gullet, scattering the fleet across half the narrow sea.
21669	All but twelve ships had finally regrouped behind the sheltering spine of Massey’s Hook, in the calmer waters of Blackwater Bay, but not before they had lost considerable time.
21670	437 Stannis would have reached the Rush days ago.
21671	The kingsroad ran from Storm’s End straight to King’s Landing, a much shorter route than by sea, and his host was largely mounted:: near twenty thousand knights, light horse, and freeriders, Renly’s unwilling legacy to his brother.
21672	They would have made good time, but armored destriers and twelve-foot lances would avail them little against the deep waters of the Blackwater Rush and the high stone walls of the city.
21673	Stannis would be camped with his lords on the south bank of the river, doubtless seething with impatience and wondering what Ser Imry had done with his fleet.
21674	Off Merling Rock two days before, they had sighted a half-dozen fishing skiffs.
21675	The fisherfolk had fled before them, but one by one they had been overtaken and boarded.
21676	“A small spoon of victory is just the thing to settle the stomach before battle,” Ser Imry had declared happily.
21677	“It makes the men hungry for a larger helping.
21678	” But Davos had been more interested in what the captives had to say about the defenses at King’s Landing.
21679	The dwarf had been busy building some sort of boom to close off the mouth of the river, though the fishermen differed as to whether the work had been completed or not.
21680	He found himself wishing it had.
21681	If the river was closed to them, Ser Imry would have no choice but to pause and take stock.
21682	The sea was full of sound: shouts and calls, warhorns and drums and the trill of pipes, the slap of wood on water as thousands of oars rose and fell.
21683	“Keep line,” Davos shouted.
21684	A gust of wind tugged at his old green cloak.
21685	A jerkin of boiled leather and a pot-helm at his feet were his only armor.
21686	At sea, heavy steel was as like to cost a man his life as to save it, he believed.
21687	Ser Imry and the other highborn captains did not share his view:: they glittered as they paced their decks.
21688	Harridan and Seahorse had slipped into their places now, and Lord Celtigar’s Red Claw beyond them.
21689	To starboard of Allard’s Lady Marya were the three galleys that Stannis had seized from the unfortunate Lord Sunglass, Piety, Prayer, and Devotion, their decks crawling with archers.
21690	Even Swordfish was closing, lumbering and rolling through a thickening sea under both oars and sail.
21691	A ship of that many oars ought to be much faster, Davos reflected with disapproval.
21692	It’s that ram she carries, it’s too big, she has no balance.
21693	The wind was gusting from the south, but under oars it made no matter.
21694	They would be sweeping in on the flood tide, but the Lannisters would have the river current to their favor, and the Blackwater Rush flowed strong and swift where it met the sea.
21695	The first shock would inevitably favor the foe.
21696	We are fools to meet them on the Blackwater, Davos thought.
21697	In any encounter on the open sea, their battle lines would envelop the enemy fleet on both flanks, driving them inward to destruction.
21698	On the river, though, the numbers and weight of Ser Imry’s ships would count for less.
21699	They could not dress more than twenty ships abreast, lest they risk tangling their oars and colliding with each other.
21700	Beyond the line of warships, Davos could see the Red Keep up on Aegon’s High Hill, dark against a lemon sky, with the mouth of the Rush opening out below.
21701	Across the river the south shore was black with men and horses, stirring like angry ants as they caught sight of the approaching ships.
21702	Stannis would have kept them busy building rafts and fletching arrows, yet even so the waiting would have been a hard thing to bear.
21703	Trumpets sounded from among them, tiny and brazen, soon swallowed by the roar of a thousand shouts.
21704	Davos closed his stubby hand around the pouch that held his fingerbones, and mouthed a silent prayer for luck.
21705	Fury herself would center the first line of battle, flanked by the Lord Steffon and the Stag of the Sea, each of two hundred oars.
21706	On the port and starboard wings were the hundreds: Lady Harra, Brightfish, Laughing Lord, Sea Demon, Horned Honor, Ragged Jenna, Trident Three, Swift Sword, Princess Rhaenys, Dog’s Nose, Sceptre, Faithful, Red Raven, Queen Alysanne, Cat, Courageous, and Dragonsbane.
21707	From every stern streamed the fiery heart of the Lord of Light, red and yellow and orange.
21708	Behind Davos and his sons came another line of 438 hundreds commanded by knights and lordly captains, and then the smaller, slower Myrish contingent, none dipping more than eighty oars.
21709	Farther back would come the sailed ships, carracks and lumbering great cogs, and last of all Salladhor Saan in his proud Valyrian, a towering three-hundred, paced by the rest of his galleys with their distinctive striped hulls.
21710	The flamboyant Lyseni princeling had not been pleased to be assigned the rear guard, but it was clear that Ser Imry trusted him no more than Stannis did.
21711	Too many complaints, and too much talk of the gold he was owed.
21712	Davos was sorry nonetheless.
21713	Salladhor Saan was a resourceful old pirate, and his crews were born seamen, fearless in a fight.
21714	They were wasted in the rear.
21715	Ahooooooooooooooooooooooooo.
21716	The call rolled across whitecaps and churning oars from the forecastle of the Fury: Ser Imry was sounding the attack.
21717	Ahoooooooooooooooooooo, ahooooooooooooooooooooo.
21718	Swordfish had joined the line at last, though she still had her sail raised.
21719	“Fast cruise,” Davos barked.
21720	The drum began to beat more quickly, and the stroke picked up, the blades of the oars cutting water, splash-swoosh, splash-swoosh, splash-swoosh.
21721	On deck, soldiers banged sword against shield, while archers quietly strung their bows and pulled the first arrow from the quivers at their belts.
21722	The galleys of the first line of battle obscured his vision, so Davos paced the deck searching for a better view.
21723	He saw no sign of any boom:: the mouth of the river was open, as if to swallow them all.
21724	Except.
21725	In his smuggling days, Davos had often jested that he knew the waterfront at King’s Landing a deal better than the back of his hand, since he had not spent a good part of his life sneaking in and out of the back of his hand.
21726	The squat towers of raw new stone that stood opposite one another at the mouth of the Blackwater might mean nothing to Ser Imry Florent, but to him it was as if two extra fingers had sprouted from his knuckles.
21727	Shading his eyes against the westering sun, he peered at those towers more closely.
21728	They were too small to hold much of a garrison.
21729	The one on the north bank was built against the bluff with the Red Keep frowning above:: its counterpart on the south shore had its footing in the water.
21730	They dug a cut through the bank, he knew at once.
21731	That would make the tower very difficult to assault:: attackers would need to wade through the water or bridge the little channel.
21732	Stannis had posted bowmen below, to fire up at the defenders whenever one was rash enough to lift his head above the ramparts, but otherwise had not troubled.
21733	Something flashed down low where the dark water swirled around the base of the tower.
21734	It was sunlight on steel, and it told Davos Seaworth all he needed to know.
21735	A chain boom.
21736	and yet they have not closed the river against us.
21737	Why? He could make a guess at that as well, but there was no time to consider the question.
21738	A shout went up from the ships ahead, and the warhorns blew again: the enemy was before them.
21739	Between the flashing oars of Sceptre and Faithful, Davos saw a thin line of galleys drawn across the river, the sun glinting off the gold paint that marked their hulls.
21740	He knew those ships as well as he knew his own.
21741	When he had been a smuggler, he’d always felt safer knowing whether the sail on the horizon marked a fast ship or a slow one, and whether her captain was a young man hungry for glory or an old one serving out his days.
21742	Ahooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, the warhorns called.
21743	“Battle speed,” Davos shouted.
21744	On port and starboard he heard Dale and Allard giving the same command.
21745	Drums began to beat furiously, oars rose and fell, and Black Betha surged forward.
21746	When he glanced toward Wraith, Dale gave him a salute.
21747	Swordfish was lagging once more, wallowing in the wake of the smaller ships to either side:: elsewise the line was straight as a shield wall.
21748	439 The river that had seemed so narrow from a distance now stretched wide as a sea, but the city had grown gigantic as well.
21749	Glowering down from Aegon’s High Hill, the Red Keep commanded the approaches.
21750	Its iron-crowned battlements, massive towers, and thick red walls gave it the aspect of a ferocious beast hunched above river and streets.
21751	The bluffs on which it crouched were steep and rocky, spotted with lichen and gnarled thorny trees.
21752	The fleet would have to pass below the castle to reach the harbor and city beyond.
21753	The first line was in the river now, but the enemy galleys were backing water.
21754	They mean to draw us in.
21755	They want us jammed close, constricted, no way to sweep around their flanks.
21756	and with that boom behind us.
21757	He paced his deck, craning his neck for a better look at Joffrey’s fleet.
21758	The boy’s toys included the ponderous Godsgrace, he saw, the old slow Prince Aemon, the Lady of Silk and her sister Lady’s Shame, Wildwind, Kingslander, White Hart, Lance, Seaflower.
21759	But where was the Lionstar? Where was the beautiful Lady Lyanna that King Robert had named in honor of the maid he’d loved and lost? And where was King Robert’s Hammer? She was the largest war galley in the royal fleet, four hundred oars, the only warship the boy king owned capable of overmatching Fury.
21760	By rights she should have formed the heart of any defense.
21761	Davos tasted a trap, yet he saw no sign of any foes sweeping in behind them, only the great fleet of Stannis Baratheon in their ordered ranks, stretching back to the watery horizon.
21762	Will they raise the chain and cut us in two? He could not see what good that would serve.
21763	The ships left out in the bay could still land men north of the city:: a slower crossing, but safer.
21764	A flight of flickering orange birds took wing from the castle, twenty or thirty of them:: pots of burning pitch, arcing out over the river trailing threads of flame.
21765	The waters ate most, but a few found the decks of galleys in the first line of battle, spreading flame when they shattered.
21766	Men-at-arms were scrambling on Queen Alysanne’s deck, and he could see smoke rising from three different spots on Dragonsbane, nearest the bank.
21767	By then a second flight was on its way, and arrows were falling as well, hissing down from the archers’ nests that studded the towers above.
21768	A soldier tumbled over Cat’s gunwale, crashed off the oars, and sank.
21769	The first man to die today, Davos thought, but he will not be the last.
21770	Atop the Red Keep’s battlements streamed the boy king’s banners: the crowned stag of Baratheon on its gold field, the lion of Lannister on crimson.
21771	More pots of pitch came flying.
21772	Davos heard men shriek as fire spread across Courageous.
21773	Her oarsmen were safe below, protected from missiles by the half-deck that sheltered them, but the men-at-arms crowded topside were not so fortunate.
21774	The starboard wing was taking all the damage, as he had feared.
21775	It will be our turn soon, he reminded himself, uneasy.
21776	Black Betha was well in range of the firepots, being the sixth ship out from the north bank.
21777	To starboard, she had only Allard’s Lady Marya, the ungainly Swordfish—so far behind now that she was nearer the third line than the second—and Piety, Prayer, and Devotion, who would need all the godly intervention they could get, placed as vulnerably as they were.
21778	As the second line swept past the twin towers, Davos took a closer look.
21779	He could see three links of a huge chain snaking out from a hole no bigger than a man’s head and disappearing under the water.
21780	The towers had a single door, set a good twenty feet off the ground.
21781	Bowmen on the roof of the northern tower were firing down at Prayer and Devotion.
21782	The archers on Devotion fired back, and Davos heard a man scream as the arrows found him.
21783	“Captain ser.
21784	” His son Matthos was at his elbow.
21785	“Your helm.
21786	” Davos took it with both hands and slid it over his head.
21787	The pot-helm was visorless:: he hated having his vision impeded.
21788	By then the pitch pots were raining down around them.
21789	He saw one shatter on the deck of Lady Marya, but Allard’s crew quickly beat it out.
21790	To port, warhorns sounded from the Pride 440 of Driftmark.
21791	The oars flung up sprays of water with every stroke.
21792	The yard-long shaft of a scorpion came down not two feet from Matthos and sank into the wood of the deck, thrumming.
21793	Ahead, the first line was within bowshot of the enemy:: flights of arrows flew between the ships, hissing like striking snakes.
21794	South of the Blackwater, Davos saw men dragging crude rafts toward the water while ranks and columns formed up beneath a thousand streaming banners.
21795	The fiery heart was everywhere, though the tiny black stag imprisoned in the flames was too small to make out.
21796	We should be flying the crowned stag, he thought.
21797	The stag was King Robert’s sigil, the city would rejoice to see it.
21798	This stranger’s standard serves only to set men against us.
21799	He could not behold the fiery heart without thinking of the shadow Melisandre had birthed in the gloom beneath Storm’s End.
21800	At least we fight this battle in the light, with the weapons of honest men, he told himself.
21801	The red woman and her dark children would have no part of it.
21802	Stannis had shipped her back to Dragonstone with his bastard nephew Edric Storm.
21803	His captains and bannermen had insisted that a battlefield was no place for a woman.
21804	Only the queen’s men had dissented, and then not loudly.
21805	All the same, the king had been on the point of refusing them until Lord Bryce Caron said, “Your Grace, if the sorceress is with us, afterward men will say it was her victory, not yours.
21806	They will say you owe your crown to her spells.
21807	” That had turned the tide.
21808	Davos himself had held his tongue during the arguments, but if truth be told, he had not been sad to see the back of her.
21809	He wanted no part of Melisandre or her god.
21810	To starboard, Devotion drove toward shore, sliding out a plank.
21811	Archers scrambled into the shallows, holding their bows high over their heads to keep the strings dry.
21812	They splashed ashore on the narrow strand beneath the bluffs.
21813	Rocks came bouncing down from the castle to crash among them, and arrows and spears as well, but the angle was steep and the missiles seemed to do little damage.
21814	Prayer landed two-dozen yards upstream and Piety was slanting toward the bank when the defenders came pounding down the riverside, the hooves of their warhorses sending up gouts of water from the shallows.
21815	The knights fell among the archers like wolves among chickens, driving them back toward the ships and into the river before most could notch an arrow.
21816	Men-at-arms rushed to defend them with spear and axe, and in three heartbeats the scene had turned to blood-soaked chaos.
21817	Davos recognized the dog’s-head helm of the Hound.
21818	A white cloak streamed from his shoulders as he rode his horse up the plank onto the deck of Prayer, hacking down anyone who blundered within reach.
21819	Beyond the castle, King’s Landing rose on its hills behind the encircling walls.
21820	The riverfront was a blackened desolation:: the Lannisters had burned everything and pulled back within the Mud Gate.
21821	The charred spars of sunken hulks sat in the shallows, forbidding access to the long stone quays.
21822	We shall have no landing there.
21823	He could see the tops of three huge trebuchets behind the Mud Gate.
21824	High on Visenya’s Hill, sunlight blazed off the seven crystal towers of the Great Sept of Baelor.
21825	Davos never saw the battle joined, but he heard it:: a great rending crash as two galleys came together.
21826	He could not say which two.
21827	Another impact echoed over the water an instant later, and then a third.
21828	Beneath the screech of splintering wood, he heard the deep thrumthump of the Fury’s fore catapult.
21829	Stag of the Sea split one of Joffrey’s galleys clean in two, but Dog’s Nose was afire and Queen Alysanne was locked between Lady of Silk and Lady’s Shame, her crew fighting the boarders rail-to-rail.
21830	Directly ahead, Davos saw the enemy’s Kingslander drive between Faithful and Sceptre.
21831	The former slid her starboard oars out of the way before impact, but Sceptre’s portside oars snapped like so much kindling as Kingslander raked along her side.
21832	“Loose,” Davos 441 commanded, and his bowmen sent a withering rain of shafts across the water.
21833	He saw Kingslander’s captain fall, and tried to recall the man’s name.
21834	Ashore, the arms of the great trebuchets rose one, two, three, and a hundred stones climbed high into the yellow sky.
21835	Each one was as large as a man’s head:: when they fell they sent up great gouts of water, smashed through oak planking, and turned living men into bone and pulp and gristle.
21836	All across the river the first line was engaged.
21837	Grappling hooks were flung out, iron rams crashed through wooden hulls, boarders swarmed, flights of arrows whispered through each other in the drifting smoke, and men died.
21838	but so far, none of his.
21839	Black Betha swept upriver, the sound of her oarmaster’s drum thundering in her captain’s head as he looked for a likely victim for her ram.
21840	The beleaguered Queen Alysanne was trapped between two Lannister warships, the three made fast by hooks and lines.
21841	“Ramming speed!” Davos shouted.
21842	The drumbeats blurred into a long fevered hammering, and Black Betha flew, the water turning white as milk as it parted for her prow.
21843	Allard had seen the same chance:: Lady Marya ran beside them.
21844	The first line had been transformed into a confusion of separate struggles.
21845	The three tangled ships loomed ahead, turning, their decks a red chaos as men hacked at each other with sword and axe.
21846	A little more, Davos Seaworth beseeched the Warrior, bring her around a little more, show me her broadside.
21847	The Warrior must have been listening.
21848	Black Betha and Lady Marya slammed into the side of Lady’s Shame within an instant of each other, ramming her fore and aft with such force that men were thrown off the deck of Lady of Silk three boats away.
21849	Davos almost bit his tongue off when his teeth jarred together.
21850	He spat out blood.
21851	Next time close your mouth, you fool.
21852	Forty years at sea, and yet this was the first time he’d rammed another ship.
21853	His archers were loosing arrows at will.
21854	“Back water,” he commanded.
21855	When Black Betha reversed her oars, the river rushed into the splintered hole she left, and Lady’s Shame fell to pieces before his eyes, spilling dozens of men into the river.
21856	Some of the living swam:: some of the dead floated:: the ones in heavy mail and plate sank to the bottom, the quick and the dead alike.
21857	The pleas of drowning men echoed in his ears.
21858	A flash of green caught his eye, ahead and off to port, and a nest of writhing emerald serpents rose burning and hissing from the stern of Queen Alysanne.
21859	An instant later Davos heard the dread cry of “Wildfire!” He grimaced.
21860	Burning pitch was one thing, wildfire quite another.
21861	Evil stuff, and wellnigh unquenchable.
21862	Smother it under a cloak and the cloak took fire:: slap at a fleck of it with your palm and your hand was aflame.
21863	“Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off,” old seamen liked to say.
21864	Still, Ser Imry had warned them to expect a taste of the alchemists’ vile substance.
21865	Fortunately, there were few true pyromancers left.
21866	They will soon run out, Ser Imry had assured them.
21867	Davos reeled off commands:: one bank of oars pushed off while the other backed water, and the galley came about.
21868	Lady Marya had won clear too, and a good thing:: the fire was spreading over Queen Alysanne and her foes faster than he would have believed possible.
21869	Men wreathed in green flame leapt into the water, shrieking like nothing human.
21870	On the walls of King’s Landing, spitfires were belching death, and the great trebuchets behind the Mud Gate were throwing boulders.
21871	One the size of an ox crashed down between Black Betha and Wraith, rocking both ships and soaking every man on deck.
21872	Another, not much smaller, found Bold Laughter.
21873	The Velaryon galley exploded like a child’s toy dropped from a tower, spraying splinters as long as a man’s arm.
21874	442 Through black smoke and swirling green fire, Davos glimpsed a swarm of small boats bearing downriver: a confusion of ferries and wherries, barges, skiffs, rowboats, and hulks that looked too rotten to float.
21875	It stank of desperation:: such driftwood could not turn the tide of a fight, only get in the way.
21876	The lines of battle were hopelessly ensnarled, he saw.
21877	Off to port, Lord Steffon, Ragged Jenna, and Swift Sword had broken through and were sweeping upriver.
21878	The starboard wing was heavily engaged, however, and the center had shattered under the stones of those trebuchets, some captains turning downstream, others veering to port, anything to escape that crushing rain.
21879	Fury had swung her aft catapult to fire back at the city, but she lacked the range:: the barrels of pitch were shattering under the walls.
21880	Sceptre had lost most of her oars, and Faithful had been rammed and was starting to list.
21881	He took Black Betha between them, and struck a glancing blow at Queen Cersei’s ornate carved-and-gilded pleasure barge, laden with soldiers instead of sweetmeats now.
21882	The collision spilled a dozen of them into the river, where Betha’s archers picked them off as they tried to stay afloat.
21883	Matthos’s shout alerted him to the danger from port:: one of the Lannister galleys was coming about to ram.
21884	“Hard to starboard,” Davos shouted.
21885	His men used their oars to push free of the barge, while others turned the galley so her prow faced the onrushing White Hart.
21886	For a moment he feared he’d been too slow, that he was about to be sunk, but the current helped swing Black Betha, and when the impact came it was only a glancing blow, the two hulls scraping against each other, both ships snapping oars.
21887	A jagged piece of wood flew past his head, sharp as any spear.
21888	Davos flinched.
21889	“Board her!” he shouted.
21890	Grappling lines were flung.
21891	He drew his sword and led them over the rail himself.
21892	The crew of the White Hart met them at the rail, but Black Betha’s men-at-arms swept over them in a screaming steel tide.
21893	Davos fought through the press, looking for the other captain, but the man was dead before he reached him.
21894	As he stood over the body, someone caught him from behind with an axe, but his helm turned the blow, and his skull was left ringing when it might have been split.
21895	Dazed, it was all he could do to roll.
21896	His attacker charged screaming.
21897	Davos grasped his sword in both hands and drove it up point-first into the man’s belly.
21898	One of his crewmen pulled him back to his feet.
21899	“Captain ser, the Hart is ours.
21900	” It was true, Davos saw.
21901	Most of the enemy were dead, dying, or yielded.
21902	He took off his helm, wiped blood from his face, and made his way back to his own ship, trodding carefully on boards slimy with men’s guts.
21903	Matthos lent him a hand to help him back over the rail.
21904	For those few instants, Black Betha and White Hart were the calm eye in the midst of the storm.
21905	Queen Alysanne and Lady of Silk, still locked together, were a raging green inferno, drifting downriver and dragging pieces of Lady’s Shame.
21906	One of the Myrish galleys had slammed into them and was now afire as well.
21907	Cat was taking on men from the fast-sinking Courageous.
21908	The captain of Dragonsbane had driven her between two quays, ripping out her bottom:: her crew poured ashore with the archers and men-at-arms to join the assault on the walls.
21909	Red Raven, rammed, was slowly listing.
21910	Stag of the Sea was fighting fires and boarders both, but the fiery heart had been raised over Joffrey’s Loyal Man.
21911	Fury, her proud bow smashed in by a boulder, was engaged with Godsgrace.
21912	He saw Lord Velaryon’s Pride of Driftmark crash between two Lannister river runners, overturning one and lighting the other up with fire arrows.
21913	On the south bank, knights were leading their mounts aboard the cogs, and some of the smaller galleys were already making their way across, laden with men-atarms.
21914	They had to thread cautiously between sinking ships and patches of drifting wildfire.
21915	The whole of King Stannis’s fleet was in the river now, save for Salladhor Saan’s Lyseni.
21916	Soon enough they would control the Blackwater.
21917	Ser Imry will have his victory, Davos thought, and Stannis will bring his host across, but gods be good, the cost of this.
21918	“Captain ser!” Matthos touched his shoulder.
21919	443 It was Swordfish, her two banks of oars lifting and falling.
21920	She had never brought down her sails, and some burning pitch had caught in her rigging.
21921	The flames spread as Davos watched, creeping out over ropes and sails until she trailed a head of yellow flame.
21922	Her ungainly iron ram, fashioned after the likeness of the fish from which she took her name, parted the surface of the river before her.
21923	Directly ahead, drifting toward her and swinging around to present a tempting plump target, was one of the Lannister hulks, floating low in the water.
21924	Slow green blood was leaking out between her boards.
21925	When he saw that, Davos Seaworth’s heart stopped beating.
21926	“No,” he said.
21927	“No, NOOOOOOOO!” Above the roar and crash of battle, no one heard him but Matthos.
21928	Certainly the captain of the Swordfish did not, intent as he was on finally spearing something with his ungainly fat sword.
21929	The Swordfish went to battle speed.
21930	Davos lifted his maimed hand to clutch at the leather pouch that held his fingerbones.
21931	With a grinding, splintering, tearing crash, Swordfish split the rotted hulk asunder.
21932	She burst like an overripe fruit, but no fruit had ever screamed that shattering wooden scream.
21933	From inside her Davos saw green gushing from a thousand broken jars, poison from the entrails of a dying beast, glistening, shining, spreading across the surface of the river.
21934	“Back water,” he roared.
21935	“Away.
21936	Get us off her, back water, back water!” The grappling lines were cut, and Davos felt the deck move under his feet as Black Betha pushed free of White Hart.
21937	Her oars slid down into the water.
21938	Then he heard a short sharp woof, as if someone had blown in his ear.
21939	Half a heartbeat later came the roar.
21940	The deck vanished beneath him, and black water smashed him across the face, filling his nose and mouth.
21941	He was choking, drowning.
21942	Unsure which way was up, Davos wrestled the river in blind panic until suddenly he broke the surface.
21943	He spat out water, sucked in air, grabbed hold of the nearest chunk of debris, and held on.
21944	Swordfish and the hulk were gone, blackened bodies were floating downstream beside him, and choking men clinging to bits of smoking wood.
21945	Fifty feet high, a swirling demon of green flame danced upon the river.
21946	It had a dozen hands, in each a whip, and whatever they touched burst into fire.
21947	He saw Black Betha burning, and White Hart and Loyal Man to either side.
21948	Piety, Cat, Courageous, Sceptre, Red Raven, Harridan, Faithful, Fury, they had all gone up, Kingslander and Godsgrace as well, the demon was eating his own.
21949	Lord Velaryon’s shining Pride of Driftmark was trying to turn, but the demon ran a lazy green finger across her silvery oars and they flared up like so many tapers.
21950	For an instant she seemed to be stroking the river with two banks of long bright torches.
21951	The current had him in its teeth by then, spinning him around and around.
21952	He kicked to avoid a floating patch of wildfire.
21953	My sons, Davos thought, but there was no way to look for them amidst the roaring chaos.
21954	Another hulk heavy with wildfire went up behind him.
21955	The Blackwater itself seemed to boil in its bed, and burning spars and burning men and pieces of broken ships filled the air.
21956	I’m being swept out into the bay.
21957	It wouldn’t be as bad there:: he ought to be able to make shore, he was a strong swimmer.
21958	Salladhor Saan’s galleys would be out in the bay as well, Ser Imry had commanded them to stand off.
21959	And then the current turned him about again, and Davos saw what awaited him downstream.
21960	The chain.
21961	Gods save us, they’ve raised the chain.
21962	Where the river broadened out into Blackwater Bay, the boom stretched taut, a bare two or three feet above the water.
21963	Already a dozen galleys had crashed into it, and the current was pushing others against them.
21964	Almost all were aflame, and the rest soon would be.
21965	Davos could 444 make out the striped hulls of Salladhor Saan’s ships beyond, but he knew he would never reach them.
21966	A wall of red-hot steel, blazing wood, and swirling green flame stretched before him.
21967	The mouth of the Blackwater Rush had turned into the mouth of hell.
21968	CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE TYRION Motionless as a gargoyle, Tyrion Lannister hunched on one knee atop a merlon.
21969	Beyond the Mud Gate and the desolation that had once been the fishmarket and wharves, the river itself seemed to have taken fire.
21970	Half of Stannis’s fleet was ablaze, along with most of Joffrey’s.
21971	The kiss of wildfire turned proud ships into funeral pyres and men into living torches.
21972	The air was full of smoke and arrows and screams.
21973	Downstream, commoners and highborn captains alike could see the hot green death swirling toward their rafts and carracks and ferries, borne on the current of the Blackwater.
21974	The long white oars of the Myrish galleys flashed like the legs of maddened centipedes as they fought to come about, but it was no good.
21975	The centipedes had no place to run.
21976	A dozen great fires raged under the city walls, where casks of burning pitch had exploded, but the wildfire reduced them to no more than candles in a burning house, their orange and scarlet pennons fluttering insignificantly against the jade holocaust.
21977	The low clouds caught the color of the burning river and roofed the sky in shades of shifting green, eerily beautiful.
21978	A terrible beauty.
21979	Like dragonfire.
21980	Tyrion wondered if Aegon the Conqueror had felt like this as he flew above his Field of Fire.
21981	The furnace wind lifted his crimson cloak and beat at his bare face, yet he could not turn away.
21982	He was dimly aware of the gold cloaks cheering from the hoardings.
21983	He had no voice to join them.
21984	It was a half victory.
21985	It will not be enough.
21986	He saw another of the hulks he’d stuffed full of King Aerys’s fickle fruits engulfed by the hungry flames.
21987	A fountain of burning jade rose from the river, the blast so bright he had to shield his eyes.
21988	Plumes of fire thirty and forty feet high danced upon the waters, crackling and hissing.
21989	For a few moments they washed out the screams.
21990	There were hundreds in the water, drowning or burning or doing a little of both.
21991	Do you hear them shrieking, Stannis? Do you see them burning? This is your work as much as mine.
21992	Somewhere in that seething mass of men south of the Blackwater, Stannis was watching too, Tyrion knew.
21993	He’d never had his brother Robert’s thirst for battle.
21994	He would command from the rear, from the reserve, much as Lord Tywin Lannister was wont to do.
21995	Like as not, he was sitting a warhorse right now, clad in bright armor, his crown upon his head.
21996	A crown of red gold, Varys says, its points fashioned in the shapes of flames.
21997	“My ships.
21998	” Joffrey’s voice cracked as he shouted up from the wallwalk, where he huddled with his guards behind the ramparts.
21999	The golden circlet of kingship adorned his battle helm.
22000	“My Kingslander’s burning, Queen Cersei, Loyal Man.
22001	Look, that’s Seaflower, there.
22002	” He pointed with his new sword, out to where the green flames were licking at Seaflower’s golden hull and creeping up her oars.
22003	Her captain had turned her upriver, but not quickly enough to evade the wildfire.
22004	She was doomed, Tyrion knew.
22005	There was no other way.
22006	If we had not come forth to meet them, Stannis would have sensed the trap.
22007	An arrow could be aimed, and a spear, even the stone from a catapult, but wildfire had a will of its own.
22008	Once loosed, it was beyond the control of mere men.
22009	“It could not be helped,” he told his nephew.
22010	“Our fleet was doomed in any case.
22011	” 445 Even from atop the merlon—he had been too short to see over the ramparts, so he’d had them boost him up—the flames and smoke and chaos of battle made it impossible for Tyrion to see what was happening downriver under the castle, but he had seen it a thousand times in his mind’s eye.
22012	Bronn would have whipped the oxen into motion the moment Stannis’s flagship passed under the Red Keep:: the chain was ponderous heavy, and the great winches turned but slowly, creaking and rumbling.
22013	The whole of the usurper’s fleet would have passed by the time the first glimmer of metal could be seen beneath the water.
22014	The links would emerge dripping-wet, some glistening with mud, link by link by link, until the whole great chain stretched taut.
22015	King Stannis had rowed his fleet up the Blackwater, but he would not row out again.
22016	Even so, some were getting away.
22017	A river’s current was a tricky thing, and the wildfire was not spreading as evenly as he had hoped.
22018	The main channel was all aflame, but a good many of the Myrmen had made for the south bank and looked to escape unscathed, and at least eight ships had landed under the city walls.
22019	Landed or wrecked, but it comes to the same thing, they’ve put men ashore.
22020	Worse, a good part of the south wing of the enemy’s first two battle lines had been well upstream of the inferno when the hulks went up.
22021	Stannis would be left with thirty or forty galleys, at a guess:: more than enough to bring his whole host across, once they had regained their courage.
22022	That might take a bit of time:: even the bravest would be dismayed after watching a thousand or so of his fellows consumed by wildfire.
22023	Hallyne said that sometimes the substance burned so hot that flesh melted like tallow.
22024	Yet even so.
22025	Tyrion had no illusions where his own men were concerned.
22026	If the battle looks to be going sour they’ll break, and they’ll break bad, Jacelyn Bywater had warned him, so the only way to win was to make certain the battle stayed sweet, start to finish.
22027	He could see dark shapes moving through the charred ruins of the riverfront wharfs.
22028	Time for another sortie, he thought.
22029	Men were never so vulnerable as when they first staggered ashore.
22030	He must not give the foe time to form up on the north bank.
22031	He scrambled down off the merlon.
22032	“Tell Lord Jacelyn we’ve got the enemy on the riverfront,” he said to one of the runners Bywater had assigned him.
22033	To another he said, “Bring my compliments to Ser Arneld and ask him to swing the Whores thirty degrees west.
22034	” The angle would allow them to throw farther, if not as far out into the water.
22035	“Mother promised I could have the Whores,” Joffrey said.
22036	Tyrion was annoyed to see that the king had lifted the visor of his helm again.
22037	Doubtless the boy was cooking inside all that heavy steel.
22038	but the last thing he needed was some stray arrow punching through his nephew’s eye.
22039	He clanged the visor shut.
22040	“Keep that closed, Your Grace:: your sweet person is precious to us all.
22041	” And you don’t want to spoil that pretty face, either.
22042	“The Whores are yours.
22043	” It was as good a time as any:: flinging more firepots down onto burning ships seemed pointless.
22044	Joff had the Antler Men trussed up naked in the square below, antlers nailed to their heads.
22045	When they’d been brought before the Iron Throne for justice, he had promised to send them to Stannis.
22046	A man was not as heavy as a boulder or a cask of burning pitch, and could be thrown a deal farther.
22047	Some of the gold cloaks had been wagering on whether the traitors would fly all the way across the Blackwater.
22048	“Be quick about it, Your Grace,” he told Joffrey.
22049	“We’ll want the trebuchets throwing stones again soon enough.
22050	Even wildfire does not burn forever.
22051	” Joffrey hurried off happy, escorted by Ser Meryn, but Tyrion caught Ser Osmund by the wrist before he could follow.
22052	“Whatever happens, keep him safe and keep him there, is that understood?”As you command.
22053	” Ser Osmund smiled amiably.
22054	446 Tyrion had warned Trant and Kettleblack what would happen to them should any harm come to the king.
22055	And Joffrey had a dozen veteran gold cloaks waiting at the foot of the steps.
22056	I’m protecting your wretched bastard as well as I can, Cersei, he thought bitterly.
22057	See you do the same for Alayaya.
22058	No sooner was Joff off than a runner came panting up the steps.
22059	“My lord, hurry!” He threw himself to one knee.
22060	“They’ve landed men on the tourney grounds, hundreds! They’re bringing a ram up to the King’s Gate.
22061	” Tyrion cursed and made for the steps with a rolling waddle.
22062	Podrick Payne waited below with their horses.
22063	They galloped off down River Row, Pod and Ser Mandon Moore coming hard behind him.
22064	The shuttered houses were steeped in green shadow, but there was no traffic to get in their way:: Tyrion had commanded that the street be kept clear, so the defenders could move quickly from one gate to the next.
22065	Even so, by the time they reached the King’s Gate, he could hear a booming crash of wood on wood that told him the battering ram had been brought into play.
22066	The groaning of the great hinges sounded like the moans of a dying giant.
22067	The gatehouse square was littered with the wounded, but he saw lines of horses as well, not all of them hurt, and sellswords and gold cloaks enough to form a strong column.
22068	“Form up,” he shouted as he leapt to the ground.
22069	The gate moved under the impact of another blow.
22070	“Who commands here? You’re going out.
22071	”No.
22072	” A shadow detached itself from the shadow of the wall, to become a tall man in dark grey armor.
22073	Sandor Clegane wrenched off his helm with both hands and let it fall to the ground.
22074	The steel was scorched and dented, the left ear of the snarling hound sheared off.
22075	A gash above one eye had sent a wash of blood down across the Hound’s old burn scars, masking half his face.
22076	“Yes.
22077	” Tyrion faced him.
22078	Clegane’s breath came ragged.
22079	“Bugger that.
22080	And you.
22081	” A sellsword stepped up beside him.
22082	“We been out.
22083	Three times.
22084	Half our men are killed or hurt.
22085	Wildfire bursting all around us, horses screaming like men and men like horses—”Did you think we hired you to fight in a tourney? Shall I bring you a nice iced milk and a bowl of raspberries? No? Then get on your fucking horse.
22086	You too, dog.
22087	” The blood on Clegane’s face glistened red, but his eyes showed white.
22088	He drew his longsword.
22089	He is afraid, Tyrion realized, shocked.
22090	The Hound is frightened.
22091	He tried to explain their need.
22092	“They’ve taken a ram to the gate, you can hear them, we need to disperse them—”Open the gates.
22093	When they rush inside, surround them and kill them.
22094	” The Hound thrust the point of his longsword into the ground and leaned upon the pommel, swaying.
22095	“I’ve lost half my men.
22096	Horse as well.
22097	I’m not taking more into that fire.
22098	” Ser Mandon Moore moved to Tyrion’s side, immaculate in his enameled white plate.
22099	“The King’s Hand commands you.
22100	”Bugger the King’s Hand.
22101	” Where the Hound’s face was not sticky with blood, it was pale as milk.
22102	“Someone bring me a drink.
22103	” A gold cloak officer handed him a cup.
22104	Clegane took a swallow, spit it out, flung the cup away.
22105	“Water? Fuck your water.
22106	Bring me wine.
22107	” He is dead on his feet.
22108	Tyrion could see it now.
22109	The wound, the fire.
22110	he’s done, I need to find someone else, but who? Ser Mandon? He looked at the men and knew it would not do.
22111	Clegane’s fear had shaken them.
22112	Without a leader, they would refuse as well, and Ser Mandon.
22113	a dangerous man, Jaime said, yes, but not a man other men would follow.
22114	447 In the distance Tyrion heard another great crash.
22115	Above the walls, the darkening sky was awash with sheets of green and orange light.
22116	How long could the gate hold? This is madness, he thought, but sooner madness than defeat.
22117	Defeat is death and shame.
22118	“Very well, I’ll lead the sortie.
22119	” If he thought that would shame the Hound back to valor, he was wrong.
22120	Clegane only laughed.
22121	“You?” Tyrion could see the disbelief on their faces.
22122	“Me.
22123	Ser Mandon, you’ll bear the king’s banner.
22124	Pod, my helm.
22125	” The boy ran to obey.
22126	The Hound leaned on that notched and bloodstreaked sword and looked at him with those wide white eyes.
22127	Ser Mandon helped Tyrion mount up again.
22128	“Form up!” he shouted.
22129	His big red stallion wore crinet and chamfron.
22130	Crimson silk draped his hindquarters, over a coat of mail.
22131	The high saddle was gilded.
22132	Podrick Payne handed up helm and shield, heavy oak emblazoned with a golden hand on red, surrounded by small golden lions.
22133	He walked his horse in a circle, looking at the little force of men.
22134	Only a handful had responded to his command, no more than twenty.
22135	They sat their horses with eyes as white as the Hound’s.
22136	He looked contemptuously at the others, the knights and sellswords who had ridden with Clegane.
22137	“They say I’m half a man,” he said.
22138	“What does that make the lot of you?” That shamed them well enough.
22139	A knight mounted, helmetless, and rode to join the others.
22140	A pair of sellswords followed.
22141	Then more.
22142	The King’s Gate shuddered again.
22143	In a few moments the size of Tyrion’s command had doubled.
22144	He had them trapped.
22145	If I fight, they must do the same, or they are less than dwarfs.
22146	“You won’t hear me shout out Joffrey’s name,” he told them.
22147	“You won’t hear me yell for Casterly Rock either.
22148	This is your city Stannis means to sack, and that’s your gate he’s bringing down.
22149	So come with me and kill the son of a bitch!” Tyrion unsheathed his axe, wheeled the stallion around, and trotted toward the sally port.
22150	He thought they were following, but never dared to look.
22151	CHAPTER SIXTY SANSA The torches shimmered brightly against the hammered metal of the wall sconces, filling the Queen’s Ballroom with silvery light.
22152	Yet there was still darkness in that hall.
22153	Sansa could see it in the pale eyes of Ser Ilyn Payne, who stood by the back door still as stone, taking neither food nor wine.
22154	She could hear it in Lord Gyles’s racking cough, and the whispered voice of Osney Kettleblack when he slipped in to bring Cersei the tidings.
22155	Sansa was finishing her broth when he came the first time, entering through the back.
22156	She glimpsed him talking to his brother Osfryd.
22157	Then he climbed the dais and knelt beside the high seat, smelling of horse, four long thin scratches on his cheek crusted with scabs, his hair falling down past his collar and into his eyes.
22158	For all his whispering, Sansa could not help but hear.
22159	“The fleets are locked in battle.
22160	Some archers got ashore, but the Hound’s cut them to pieces, Y’Grace.
22161	Your brother’s raising his chain, I heard the signal.
22162	Some drunkards down to Flea Bottom are smashing doors and climbing through windows.
22163	Lord Bywater’s sent the gold cloaks to deal with them.
22164	Baelor’s Sept is jammed full, everyone praying.
22165	”And my son?”The king went to Baelor’s to get the High Septon’s blessing.
22166	Now he’s walking the walls with the Hand, telling the men to be brave, lifting their spirits as it were.
22167	” 448 Cersei beckoned to her page for another cup of wine, a golden vintage from the Arbor, fruity and rich.
22168	The queen was drinking heavily, but the wine only seemed to make her more beautiful:: her cheeks were flushed, and her eyes had a bright, feverish heat to them as she looked down over the hall.
22169	Eyes of wildfire, Sansa thought.
22170	Musicians played.
22171	Jugglers juggled.
22172	Moon Boy lurched about the hall on stilts making mock of everyone, while Ser Dontos chased serving girls on his broomstick horse.
22173	The guests laughed, but it was a joyless laughter, the sort of laughter that can turn into sobbing in half a heartbeat.
22174	Their bodies are here, but their thoughts are on the city walls, and their hearts as well.
22175	After the broth came a salad of apples, nuts, and raisins.
22176	At any other time, it might have made a tasty dish, but tonight all the food was flavored with fear.
22177	Sansa was not the only one in the hall without an appetite.
22178	Lord Gyles was coughing more than he was eating, Lollys Stokeworth sat hunched and shivering, and the young bride of one of Ser Lancel’s knights began to weep uncontrollably.
22179	The queen commanded Maester Frenken to put her to bed with a cup of dreamwine.
22180	“Tears,” she said scornfully to Sansa as the woman was led from the hall.
22181	“The woman’s weapon, my lady mother used to call them.
22182	The man’s weapon is a sword.
22183	And that tells us all you need to know, doesn’t it?”Men must be very brave, though,” said Sansa.
22184	“To ride out and face swords and axes, everyone trying to kill you.
22185	”Jaime told me once that he only feels truly alive in battle and in bed.
22186	” She lifted her cup and took a long swallow.
22187	Her salad was untouched.
22188	“I would sooner face any number of swords than sit helpless like this, pretending to enjoy the company of this flock of frightened hens.
22189	”You asked them here, Your Grace.
22190	”Certain things are expected of a queen.
22191	They will be expected of you should you ever wed Joffrey.
22192	Best learn.
22193	” The queen studied the wives, daughters, and mothers who filled the benches.
22194	“Of themselves the hens are nothing, but their cocks are important for one reason or another, and some may survive this battle.
22195	So it behooves me to give their women my protection.
22196	If my wretched dwarf of a brother should somehow manage to prevail, they will return to their husbands and fathers full of tales about how brave I was, how my courage inspired them and lifted their spirits, how I never doubted our victory even for a moment.
22197	”And if the castle should fall?”You’d like that, wouldn’t you?” Cersei did not wait for a denial.
22198	“If I’m not betrayed by my own guards, I may be able to hold here for a time.
22199	Then I can go to the walls and offer to yield to Lord Stannis in person.
22200	That will spare us the worst.
22201	But if Maegor’s Holdfast should fall before Stannis can come up, why then, most of my guests are in for a bit of rape, I’d say.
22202	And you should never rule out mutilation, torture, and murder at times like these.
22203	” Sansa was horrified.
22204	“These are women, unarmed, and gently born.
22205	”Their birth protects them,” Cersei admitted, “though not as much as you’d think.
22206	Each one’s worth a good ransom, but after the madness of battle, soldiers often seem to want flesh more than coin.
22207	Even so, a golden shield is better than none.
22208	Out in the streets, the women won’t be treated near as tenderly.
22209	Nor will our servants.
22210	Pretty things like that serving wench of Lady Tanda’s could be in for a lively night, but don’t imagine the old and the infirm and the ugly will be spared.
22211	Enough drink will make blind washerwomen and reeking pig girls seem as comely as you, sweetling.
22212	”Me?” 449 “Try not to sound so like a mouse, Sansa.
22213	You’re a woman now, remember? And betrothed to my firstborn.
22214	” The queen sipped at her wine.
22215	“Were it anyone else outside the gates, I might hope to beguile him.
22216	But this is Stannis Baratheon.
22217	I’d have a better chance of seducing his horse.
22218	” She noticed the look on Sansa’s face, and laughed.
22219	“Have I shocked you, my lady?” She leaned close.
22220	“You little fool.
22221	Tears are not a woman’s only weapon.
22222	You’ve got another one between your legs, and you’d best learn to use it.
22223	You’ll find men use their swords freely enough.
22224	Both kinds of swords.
22225	” Sansa was spared the need to reply when two Kettleblacks reentered the hall.
22226	Ser Osmund and his brothers had become great favorites about the castle:: they were always ready with a smile and a jest, and got on with grooms and huntsmen as well as they did with knights and squires.
22227	With the serving wenches they got on best of all, it was gossiped.
22228	Of late Ser Osmund had taken Sandor Clegane’s place by Joffrey’s side, and Sansa had heard the women at the washing well saying he was as strong as the Hound, only younger and faster.
22229	If that was so, she wondered why she had never once heard of these Kettleblacks before Ser Osmund was named to the Kingsguard.
22230	Osney was all smiles as he knelt beside the queen.
22231	“The hulks have gone up, Y’Grace.
22232	The whole Blackwater’s awash with wildfire.
22233	A hundred ships burning, maybe more.
22234	”And my son?”He’s at the Mud Gate with the Hand and the Kingsguard, Y’Grace.
22235	He spoke to the archers on the hoardings before, and gave them a few tips on handling a crossbow, he did.
22236	All agree, he’s a right brave boy.
22237	”He’d best remain a right live boy.
22238	” Cersei turned to his brother Osfryd, who was taller, sterner, and wore a drooping black mustache.
22239	“Yes?” Osfryd had donned a steel half-helm over his long black hair, and the look on his face was grim, “Y’Grace,” he said quietly, “the boys caught a groom and two maidservants trying to sneak out a postern with three of the king’s horses.
22240	”The night’s first traitors,” the queen said, “but not the last, I fear.
22241	Have Ser Ilyn see to them, and put their heads on pikes outside the stables as a warning.
22242	” As they left, she turned to Sansa.
22243	“Another lesson you should learn, if you hope to sit beside my son.
22244	Be gentle on a night like this and you’ll have treasons popping up all about you like mushrooms after a hard rain.
22245	The only way to keep your people loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy.
22246	”I will remember, Your Grace,” said Sansa, though she had always heard that love was a surer route to the people’s loyalty than fear.
22247	If I am ever a queen, I’ll make them love me.
22248	Crabclaw pies followed the salad.
22249	Then came mutton roasted with leeks and carrots, served in trenchers of hollowed bread.
22250	Lollys ate too fast, got sick, and retched all over herself and her sister.
22251	Lord Gyles coughed, drank, coughed, drank, and passed out.
22252	The queen gazed down in disgust to where he sprawled with his face in his trencher and his hand in a puddle of wine.
22253	“The gods must have been mad to waste manhood on the likes of him, and I must have been mad to demand his release.
22254	” Osfryd Kettleblack returned, crimson cloak swirling.
22255	“There’s folks gathering in the square, Y’Grace, asking to take refuge in the castle.
22256	Not a mob, rich merchants and the like.
22257	”Command them to return to their homes,” the queen said.
22258	“If they won’t go, have our crossbowmen kill a few.
22259	No sorties:: I won’t have the gates opened for any reason.
22260	”As you command.
22261	” He bowed and moved off.
22262	450 The queen’s face was hard and angry.
22263	“Would that I could take a sword to their necks myself.
22264	” Her voice was starting to slur.
22265	“When we were little, Jaime and I were so much alike that even our lord father could not tell us apart.
22266	Sometimes as a lark we would dress in each other’s clothes and spend a whole day each as the other.
22267	Yet even so, when Jaime was given his first sword, there was none for me.
22268	‘What do I get?’ I remember asking.
22269	We were so much alike, I could never understand why they treated us so differently.
22270	Jaime learned to fight with sword and lance and mace, while I was taught to smile and sing and please.
22271	He was heir to Casterly Rock, while I was to be sold to some stranger like a horse, to be ridden whenever my new owner liked, beaten whenever he liked, and cast aside in time for a younger filly.
22272	Jaime’s lot was to be glory and power, while mine was birth and moonblood.
22273	”But you were queen of all the Seven Kingdoms,” Sansa said.
22274	“When it comes to swords, a queen is only a woman after all.
22275	” Cersei’s wine cup was empty.
22276	The page moved to fill it again, but she turned it over and shook her head.
22277	“No more.
22278	I must keep a clear head.
22279	” The last course was goat cheese served with baked apples.
22280	The scent of cinnamon filled the hall as Osney Kettleblack slipped in to kneel once more between them.
22281	“Y’Grace,” he murmured.
22282	“Stannis has landed men on the tourney grounds, and there’s more coming across.
22283	The Mud Gate’s under attack, and they’ve brought a ram to the King’s Gate.
22284	The Imp’s gone out to drive them off.
22285	”That will fill them with fear,” the queen said dryly.
22286	“He hasn’t taken Joff, I hope.
22287	”No, Y’Grace, the king’s with my brother at the Whores, flinging Antler Men into the river.
22288	”With the Mud Gate under assault? Folly.
22289	Tell Ser Osmund I want him out of there at once, it’s too dangerous.
22290	Fetch him back to the castle.
22291	”The Imp said—”It’s what I said that ought concern you.
22292	” Cersei’s eyes narrowed.
22293	“Your brother will do as he’s told, or I’ll see to it that he leads the next sortie himself, and you’ll go with him.
22294	” After the meal had been cleared away, many of the guests asked leave to go to the sept.
22295	Cersei graciously granted their request.
22296	Lady Tanda and her daughters were among those who fled.
22297	For those who remained, a singer was brought forth to fill the hall with the sweet music of the high harp.
22298	He sang of Jonquil and Florian, of Prince Aemon the Dragonknight and his love for his brother’s queen, of Nymeria’s ten thousand ships.
22299	They were beautiful songs, but terribly sad.
22300	Several of the women began to weep, and Sansa felt her own eyes growing moist.
22301	“Very good, dear.
22302	” The queen leaned close.
22303	“You want to practice those tears.
22304	You’ll need them for King Stannis.
22305	” Sansa shifted nervously.
22306	“Your Grace?”Oh, spare me your hollow courtesies.
22307	Matters must have reached a desperate strait out there if they need a dwarf to lead them, so you might as well take off your mask.
22308	I know all about your little treasons in the godswood.
22309	”The godswood?” Don’t look at Ser Dontos, don’t, don’t, Sansa told herself.
22310	She doesn’t know, no one knows, Dontos promised me, my Florian would never fail me.
22311	“I’ve done no treasons.
22312	I only visit the godswood to pray.
22313	”For Stannis.
22314	Or your brother, it’s all the same.
22315	Why else seek your father’s gods? You’re praying for our defeat.
22316	What would you call that, if not treason?”I pray for Joffrey,” she insisted nervously.
22317	451 “Why, because he treats you so sweetly?” The queen took a flagon of sweet plum wine from a passing serving girl and filled Sansa’s cup.
22318	“Drink,” she commanded coldly.
22319	“Perhaps it will give you the courage to deal with truth for a change.
22320	” Sansa lifted the cup to her lips and took a sip.
22321	The wine was cloyingly sweet, but very strong.
22322	“You can do better than that,” Cersei said.
22323	“Drain the cup, Sansa.
22324	Your queen commands you.
22325	” It almost gagged her, but Sansa emptied the cup, gulping down the thick sweet wine until her head was swimming.
22326	“More?” Cersei asked.
22327	“No.
22328	Please.
22329	” The queen looked displeased.
22330	“When you asked about Ser Ilyn earlier, I lied to you.
22331	Would you like to hear the truth, Sansa? Would you like to know why he’s really here?” She did not dare answer, but it did not matter.
22332	The queen raised a hand and beckoned, never waiting for a reply.
22333	Sansa had not even seen Ser Ilyn return to the hall, but suddenly there he was, striding from the shadows behind the dais as silent as a cat.
22334	He carried Ice unsheathed.
22335	Her father had always cleaned the blade in the godswood after he took a man’s head, Sansa recalled, but Ser Ilyn was not so fastidious.
22336	There was blood drying on the rippling steel, the red already fading to brown.
22337	“Tell Lady Sansa why I keep you by us,” said Cersei.
22338	Ser Ilyn opened his mouth and emitted a choking rattle.
22339	His pox-scarred face had no expression.
22340	“He’s here for us, he says,” the queen said.
22341	“Stannis may take the city and he may take the throne, but I will not suffer him to judge me.
22342	I do not mean for him to have us alive.
22343	”Us?”You heard me.
22344	So perhaps you had best pray again, Sansa, and for a different outcome.
22345	The Starks will have no joy from the fall of House Lannister, I promise you.
22346	” She reached out and touched Sansa’s hair, brushing it lightly away from her neck.
22347	CHAPTER SIXTY-ONE TYRION The slot in his helm limited Tyrion’s vision to what was before him, but when he turned his head he saw three galleys beached on the tourney grounds, and a fourth, larger than the others, standing well out into the river, firing barrels of burning pitch from a catapult.
22348	“Wedge,” Tyrion commanded as his men streamed out of the sally port.
22349	They formed up in spearhead, with him at the point.
22350	Ser Mandon Moore took the place to his right, flames shimmering against the white enamel of his armor, his dead eyes shining passionlessly through his helm.
22351	He rode a coal-black horse barded all in white, with the pure white shield of the Kingsguard strapped to his arm.
22352	On the left, Tyrion was surprised to see Podrick Payne, a sword in his hand.
22353	“You’re too young,” he said at once.
22354	“Go back.
22355	”I’m your squire, my lord.
22356	” Tyrion could spare no time for argument.
22357	“With me, then.
22358	Stay close.
22359	” He kicked his horse into motion.
22360	They rode knee to knee, following the line of the looming walls.
22361	Joffrey’s standard streamed crimson and gold from Ser Mandon’s staff, stag and lion dancing hoof to paw.
22362	They went from a walk to a trot, wheeling wide around the base of the tower.
22363	Arrows darted from 452 the city walls while stones spun and tumbled overhead, crashing down blindly onto earth and water, steel and flesh.
22364	Ahead loomed the King’s Gate and a surging mob of soldiers wrestling with a huge ram, a shaft of black oak with an iron head.
22365	Archers off the ships surrounded them, loosing their shafts at whatever defenders showed themselves on the gatehouse walls.
22366	“Lances,” Tyrion commanded.
22367	He sped to a canter.
22368	The ground was sodden and slippery, equal parts mud and blood.
22369	His stallion stumbled over a corpse, his hooves sliding and churning the earth, and for an instant Tyrion feared his charge would end with him tumbling from the saddle before he even reached the foe, but somehow he and his horse both managed to keep their balance.
22370	Beneath the gate men were turning, hurriedly trying to brace for the shock.
22371	Tyrion lifted his axe and shouted, “King’s Landing!” Other voices took up the cry, and now the arrowhead flew, a long scream of steel and silk, pounding hooves and sharp blades kissed by fire.
22372	Ser Mandon dropped the point of his lance at the last possible instant, and drove Joffrey’s banner through the chest of a man in a studded jerkin, lifting him full off his feet before the shaft snapped.
22373	Ahead of Tyrion was a knight whose surcoat showed a fox peering through a ring of flowers.
22374	Florent was his first thought, but helmless ran a close second.
22375	He smashed the man in the face with all the weight of axe and arm and charging horse, taking off half his head.
22376	The shock of impact numbed his shoulder.
22377	Shagga would laugh at me, he thought, riding on.
22378	A spear thudded against his shield.
22379	Pod galloped beside him, slashing down at every foe they passed.
22380	Dimly, he heard cheers from the men on the walls.
22381	The battering ram crashed down into the mud, forgotten in an instant as its handlers fled or turned to fight.
22382	Tyrion rode down an archer, opened a spearman from shoulder to armpit, glanced a blow off a swordfishcrested helm.
22383	At the ram his big red reared but the black stallion leapt the obstacle smoothly and Ser Mandon flashed past him, death in snow-white silk.
22384	His sword sheared off limbs, cracked heads, broke shields asunder—though few enough of the enemy had made it across the river with shields intact.
22385	Tyrion urged his mount over the ram.
22386	Their foes were fleeing.
22387	He moved his head right to left and back again, but saw no sign of Podrick Payne.
22388	An arrow clattered against his cheek, missing his eye-slit by an inch.
22389	His jolt of fear almost unhorsed him.
22390	If I’m to sit here like a stump, I had as well paint a target on my breastplate.
22391	He spurred his horse back into motion, trotting over and around a scatter of corpses.
22392	Downriver, the Blackwater was jammed with the hulks of burning galleys.
22393	Patches of wildfire still floated atop the water, sending fiery green plumes swirling twenty feet into the air.
22394	They had dispersed the men on the battering ram, but he could see fighting all along the riverfront.
22395	Ser Balon Swann’s men, most like, or Lancel’s, trying to throw the enemy back into the water as they swarmed ashore off the burning ships.
22396	“We’ll ride for the Mud Gate,” he commanded.
22397	Ser Mandon shouted, “The Mud Gate!” And they were off again.
22398	“King’s Landing!” his men cried raggedly, and “Halfman! Halfman!” He wondered who had taught them that.
22399	Through the steel and padding of his helm, he heard anguished screams, the hungry crackle of flame, the shuddering of warhorns, and the brazen blast of trumpets.
22400	Fire was everywhere.
22401	Gods be good, no wonder the Hound was frightened.
22402	It’s the flames he fears.
22403	A splintering crash rang across the Blackwater as a stone the size of a horse landed square amidships on one of the galleys.
22404	Ours or theirs? Through the roiling smoke, he could not tell.
22405	His wedge was gone:: every man was his own battle now.
22406	I should have turned back, he thought, riding on.
22407	453 The axe was heavy in his fist.
22408	A handful still followed him, the rest dead or fled.
22409	He had to wrestle his stallion to keep his head to the east.
22410	The big destrier liked fire no more than Sandor Clegane had, but the horse was easier to cow.
22411	Men were crawling from the river, men burned and bleeding, coughing up water, staggering, most dying.
22412	He led his troop among them, delivering quicker cleaner deaths to those strong enough to stand.
22413	The war shrank to the size of his eye-slit.
22414	Knights twice his size fled from him, or stood and died.
22415	They seemed little things, and fearful.
22416	“Lannister!” he shouted, slaying.
22417	His arm was red to the elbow, glistening in the light off the river.
22418	When his horse reared again, he shook his axe at the stars and heard them call out “Halfman! Halfman!” Tyrion felt drunk.
22419	The battle fever.
22420	He had never thought to experience it himself, though Jaime had told him of it often enough.
22421	How time seemed to blur and slow and even stop, how the past and the future vanished until there was nothing but the instant, how fear fled, and thought fled, and even your body.
22422	“You don’t feel your wounds then, or the ache in your back from the weight of the armor, or the sweat running down into your eyes.
22423	You stop feeling, you stop thinking, you stop being you, there is only the fight, the foe, this man and then the next and the next and the next, and you know they are afraid and tired but you’re not, you’re alive, and death is all around you but their swords move so slowly, you can dance through them laughing.
22424	” Battle fever.
22425	I am half a man and drunk with slaughter, let them kill me if they can! They tried.
22426	Another spearman ran at him.
22427	Tyrion lopped off the head of his spear, then his hand, then his arm, trotting around him in a circle.
22428	An archer, bowless, thrust at him with an arrow, holding it as if it were a knife.
22429	The destrier kicked at the man’s thigh to send him sprawling, and Tyrion barked laughter.
22430	He rode past a banner planted in the mud, one of Stannis’s fiery hearts, and chopped the staff in two with a swing of his axe.
22431	A knight rose up from nowhere to hack at his shield with a two-handed greatsword, again and again, until someone thrust a dagger under his arm.
22432	One of Tyrion’s men, perhaps.
22433	He never saw.
22434	“I yield, ser,” a different knight called out, farther down the river.
22435	“Yield.
22436	Ser knight, I yield to you.
22437	My pledge, here, here.
22438	” The man lay in a puddle of black water, offering up a lobstered gauntlet in token of submission.
22439	Tyrion had to lean down to take it from him.
22440	As he did, a pot of wildfire burst overhead, spraying green flame.
22441	In the sudden stab of light he saw that the puddle was not black but red.
22442	The gauntlet still had the knight’s hand in it.
22443	He flung it back.
22444	“Yield,” the man sobbed hopelessly, helplessly.
22445	Tyrion reeled away.
22446	A man-at-arms grabbed the bridle of his horse and thrust at Tyrion’s face with a dagger.
22447	He knocked the blade aside and buried the axe in the nape of the man’s neck.
22448	As he was wresting it free, a blaze of white appeared at the edge of his vision.
22449	Tyrion turned, thinking to find Ser Mandon Moore beside him again, but this was a different white knight.
22450	Ser Balon Swann wore the same armor, but his horse trappings bore the battling black-and-white swans of his House.
22451	He’s more a spotted knight than a white one, Tyrion thought inanely.
22452	Every bit of Ser Balon was spattered with gore and smudged by smoke.
22453	He raised his mace to point downriver.
22454	Bits of brain and bone clung to its head.
22455	“My lord, look.
22456	” Tyrion swung his horse about to peer down the Blackwater.
22457	The current still flowed black and strong beneath, but the surface was a roil of blood and flame.
22458	The sky was red and orange and garish green.
22459	“What?” he said.
22460	Then he saw.
22461	Steel-clad men-at-arms were clambering off a broken galley that had smashed into a pier.
22462	So many, where are they coming from? Squinting into the smoke and glare, Tyrion followed them back out into the river.
22463	Twenty galleys were jammed together out there, maybe more, it was hard to count.
22464	Their oars were crossed, their hulls locked together with grappling lines, they were impaled on each other’s rams, tangled in webs of fallen rigging.
22465	One great hulk 454 floated hull-up between two smaller ships.
22466	Wrecks, but packed so closely that it was possible to leap from one deck to the other and so cross the Blackwater.
22467	Hundreds of Stannis Baratheon’s boldest were doing just that.
22468	Tyrion saw one great fool of a knight trying to ride across, urging a terrified horse over gunwales and oars, across tilting decks slick with blood and crackling with green fire.
22469	We made them a bloody bridge, he thought in dismay.
22470	Parts of the bridge were sinking and other parts were afire and the whole thing was creaking and shifting and like to burst asunder at any moment, but that did not seem to stop them.
22471	“Those are brave men,” he told Ser Balon in admiration.
22472	“Let’s go kill them.
22473	” He led them through the guttering fires and the soot and ash of the riverfront, pounding down a long stone quay with his own men and Ser Balon’s behind him.
22474	Ser Mandon fell in with them, his shield a ragged ruin.
22475	Smoke and cinders swirled through the air, and the foe broke before their charge, throwing themselves back into the water, knocking over other men as they fought to climb up.
22476	The foot of the bridge was a half-sunken enemy galley with Dragonsbane painted on her prow, her bottom ripped out by one of the sunken hulks Tyrion had placed between the quays.
22477	A spearman wearing the red crab badge of House Celtigar drove the point of his weapon up through the chest of Balon Swann’s horse before he could dismount, spilling the knight from the saddle.
22478	Tyrion hacked at the man’s head as he flashed by, and by then it was too late to rein up.
22479	His stallion leapt from the end of the quay and over a splintered gunwale, landing with a splash and a scream in ankle-deep water.
22480	Tyrion’s axe went spinning, followed by Tyrion himself, and the deck rose up to give him a wet smack.
22481	Madness followed.
22482	His horse had broken a leg and was screaming horribly.
22483	Somehow he managed to draw his dagger, and slit the poor creature’s throat.
22484	The blood gushed out in a scarlet fountain, drenching his arms and chest.
22485	He found his feet again and lurched to the rail, and then he was fighting, staggering and splashing across crooked decks awash with water.
22486	Men came at him.
22487	Some he killed, some he wounded, and some went away, but always there were more.
22488	He lost his knife and gained a broken spear, he could not have said how.
22489	He clutched it and stabbed, shrieking curses.
22490	Men ran from him and he ran after them, clambering up over the rail to the next ship and then the next.
22491	His two white shadows were always with him:: Balon Swann and Mandon Moore, beautiful in their pale plate.
22492	Surrounded by a circle of Velaryon spearmen, they fought back to back:: they made battle as graceful as a dance.
22493	His own killing was a clumsy thing.
22494	He stabbed one man in the kidney when his back was turned, and grabbed another by the leg and upended him into the river.
22495	Arrows hissed past his head and clattered off his armor:: one lodged between shoulder and breastplate, but he never felt it.
22496	A naked man fell from the sky and landed on the deck, body bursting like a melon dropped from a tower.
22497	His blood spattered through the slit of Tyrion’s helm.
22498	Stones began to plummet down, crashing through the decks and turning men to pulp, until the whole bridge gave a shudder and twisted violently underfoot, knocking him sideways.
22499	Suddenly the river was pouring into his helm.
22500	He ripped it off and crawled along the listing deck until the water was only neck-deep.
22501	A groaning filled the air, like the death cries of some enormous beast, The ship, he had time to think, the ship’s about to tear loose.
22502	The broken galleys were ripping apart, the bridge breaking apart.
22503	No sooner had he come to that realization than he heard a sudden crack, loud as thunder, the deck lurched beneath him, and he slid back down into the water.
22504	The list was so steep he had to climb back up, hauling himself along a snapped line inch by bloody inch.
22505	Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the hulk they’d been tangled with drifting downstream with the current, spinning slowly as men leapt over her side.
22506	Some wore Stannis’s flaming heart, some Joffrey’s stag-and-lion, some other badges, but it seemed to make no matter.
22507	Fires were burning upstream and down.
22508	On one side of him was a raging battle, a great confusion of bright banners waving above a sea of struggling men, shield walls 455 forming and breaking, mounted knights cutting through the press, dust and mud and blood and smoke.
22509	On the other side, the Red Keep loomed high on its hill, spitting fire.
22510	They were on the wrong sides, though.
22511	For a moment Tyrion thought he was going mad, that Stannis and the castle had traded places.
22512	How could Stannis cross to the north bank? Belatedly he realized that the deck was turning, and somehow he had gotten spun about, so castle and battle had changed sides.
22513	Battle, what battle, if Stannis hasn’t crossed who is he fighting? Tyrion was too tired to make sense of it.
22514	His shoulder ached horribly, and when he reached up to rub it he saw the arrow, and remembered.
22515	I have to get off this ship.
22516	Downstream was nothing but a wall of fire, and if the wreck broke loose the current would take him right into it.
22517	Someone was calling his name faintly through the din of battle.
22518	Tyrion tried to shout back.
22519	“Here! Here, I’m here, help me!” His voice sounded so thin he could scarcely hear himself.
22520	He pulled himself up the slanting deck, and grabbed for the rail.
22521	The hull slammed into the next galley over and rebounded so violently he was almost knocked into the water.
22522	Where had all his strength gone? It was all he could do to hang on.
22523	“MY LORD! TAKE MY HAND! MY LORD TYRION!” There on the deck of the next ship, across a widening gulf of black water, stood Ser Mandon Moore, a hand extended.
22524	Yellow and green fire shone against the white of his armor, and his lobstered gauntlet was sticky with blood, but Tyrion reached for it all the same, wishing his arms were longer.
22525	It was only at the very last, as their fingers brushed across the gap, that something niggled at him.
22526	Ser Mandon was holding out his left hand, why.
22527	Was that why he reeled backward, or did he see the sword after all? He would never know.
22528	The point slashed just beneath his eyes, and he felt its cold hard touch and then a blaze of pain.
22529	His head spun around as if he’d been slapped.
22530	The shock of the cold water was a second slap more jolting than the first.
22531	He flailed for something to grab on to, knowing that once he went down he was not like to come back up.
22532	Somehow his hand found the splintered end of a broken oar.
22533	Clutching it tight as a desperate lover, he shinnied up foot by foot.
22534	His eyes were full of water, his mouth was full of blood, and his head throbbed horribly.
22535	Gods give me strength to reach the deck.
22536	There was nothing else, only the oar, the water, the deck.
22537	Finally he rolled over the side and lay breathless and exhausted, flat on his back.
22538	Balls of green and orange flame crackled overhead, leaving streaks between the stars.
22539	He had a moment to think how pretty it was before Ser Mandon blocked out the view.
22540	The knight was a white steel shadow, his eyes shining darkly behind his helm.
22541	Tyrion had no more strength than a rag doll.
22542	Ser Mandon put the point of his sword to the hollow of his throat and curled both hands around the hilt.
22543	And suddenly he lurched to the left, staggering into the rail.
22544	Wood split, and Ser Mandon Moore vanished with a shout and a splash.
22545	An instant later, the hulls came slamming together again, so hard the deck seemed to jump.
22546	Then someone was kneeling over him.
22547	“Jaime?” he croaked, almost choking on the blood that filled his mouth.
22548	Who else would save him, if not his brother? “Be still, my lord, you’re hurt bad.
22549	” A boy’s voice, that makes no sense, thought Tyrion.
22550	It sounded almost like Pod.
22551	CHAPTER SIXTY-TWO SANSA 456 When Ser Lancel Lannister told the queen that the battle was lost, she turned her empty wine cup in her hands and said, “Tell my brother, ser.
22552	” Her voice was distant, as if the news were of no great interest to her.
22553	“Your brother’s likely dead.
22554	” Ser Lancel’s surcoat was soaked with the blood seeping out under his arm.
22555	When he had arrived in the hall, the sight of him had made some of the guests scream.
22556	“He was on the bridge of boats when it broke apart, we think.
22557	Ser Mandon’s likely gone as well, and no one can find the Hound.
22558	Gods be damned, Cersei, why did you have them fetch Joffrey back to the castle? The gold cloaks are throwing down their spears and running, hundreds of them.
22559	When they saw the king leaving, they lost all heart.
22560	The whole Blackwater’s awash with wrecks and fire and corpses, but we could have held if—” Osney Kettleblack pushed past him.
22561	“There’s fighting on both sides of the river now, Y’Grace.
22562	It may be that some of Stannis’s lords are fighting each other, no one’s sure, it’s all confused over there.
22563	The Hound’s gone, no one knows where, and Ser Balon’s fallen back inside the city.
22564	The riverside’s theirs.
22565	They’re ramming at the King’s Gate again, and Ser Lancel’s right, your men are deserting the walls and killing their own officers.
22566	There’s mobs at the Iron Gate and the Gate of the Gods fighting to get out, and Flea Bottom’s one great drunken riot.
22567	” Gods be good, Sansa thought, it is happening, Joffrey’s lost his head and so have I.
22568	She looked for Ser Ilyn, but the King’s Justice was not to be seen.
22569	I can feel him, though.
22570	He’s close, I’ll not escape him, he’ll have my head.
22571	Strangely calm, the queen turned to his brother Osfryd.
22572	“Raise the drawbridge and bar the doors.
22573	No one enters or leaves Maegor’s without my leave.
22574	”What about them women who went to pray?”They chose to leave my protection.
22575	Let them pray:: perhaps the gods will defend them.
22576	Where’s my son?”The castle gatehouse.
22577	He wanted to command the crossbowmen.
22578	There’s a mob howling outside, half of them gold cloaks who came with him when we left the Mud Gate.
22579	”Bring him inside Maegor’s now.
22580	”No!” Lancel was so angry he forgot to keep his voice down.
22581	Heads turned toward them as he shouted, “We’ll have the Mud Gate all over again.
22582	Let him stay where he is, he’s the king—”He’s my son.
22583	” Cersei Lannister rose to her feet.
22584	“You claim to be a Lannister as well, cousin, prove it.
22585	Osfryd, why are you standing there? Now means today.
22586	” Osfryd Kettleblack hurried from the hall, his brother with him.
22587	Many of the guests were rushing out as well.
22588	Some of the women were weeping, some praying.
22589	Others simply remained at the tables and called for more wine.
22590	“Cersei,” Ser Lancel pleaded, “if we lose the castle, Joffrey will be killed in any case, you know that.
22591	Let him stay, I’ll keep him by me, I swear—”Get out of my way.
22592	” Cersei slammed her open palm into his wound.
22593	Ser Lancel cried out in pain and almost fainted as the queen swept from the room.
22594	She spared Sansa not so much as a glance.
22595	She’s forgotten me.
22596	Ser Ilyn will kill me and she won’t even think about it.
22597	“Oh, gods,” an old woman wailed.
22598	“We’re lost, the battle’s lost, she’s running.
22599	” Several children were crying.
22600	They can smell the fear.
22601	Sansa found herself alone on the dais.
22602	Should she stay here, or run after the queen and plead for her life? 457 She never knew why she got to her feet, but she did.
22603	“Don’t be afraid,” she told them loudly.
22604	“The queen has raised the drawbridge.
22605	This is the safest place in the city.
22606	There’s thick walls, the moat, the spikes.
22607	”What’s happened?” demanded a woman she knew slightly, the wife of a lesser lordling.
22608	“What did Osney tell her? Is the king hurt, has the city fallen?”Tell us,” someone else shouted.
22609	One woman asked about her father, another her son.
22610	Sansa raised her hands for quiet.
22611	“Joffrey’s come back to the castle.
22612	He’s not hurt.
22613	They’re still fighting, that’s all I know, they’re fighting bravely.
22614	The queen will be back soon.
22615	” The last was a lie, but she had to soothe them.
22616	She noticed the fools standing under the galley.
22617	“Moon Boy, make us laugh.
22618	” Moon Boy did a cartwheel, and vaulted on top of a table.
22619	He grabbed up four wine cups and began to juggle them.
22620	Every so often one of them would come down and smash him in the head.
22621	A few nervous laughs echoed through the hall.
22622	Sansa went to Ser Lancel and knelt beside him.
22623	His wound was bleeding afresh where the queen had struck him.
22624	“Madness,” he gasped.
22625	“Gods, the Imp was right, was right.
22626	”Help him,” Sansa commanded two of the serving men.
22627	One just looked at her and ran, flagon and all.
22628	Other servants were leaving the hall as well, but she could not help that.
22629	Together, Sansa and the serving man got the wounded knight back on his feet.
22630	“Take him to Maester Frenken.
22631	” Lancel was one of them, yet somehow she still could not bring herself to wish him dead.
22632	I am soft and weak and stupid, just as Joffrey says.
22633	I should be killing him, not helping him.
22634	The torches had begun to burn low, and one or two had flickered out.
22635	No one troubled to replace them.
22636	Cersei did not return.
22637	Ser Dontos climbed the dais while all eyes were on the other fool.
22638	“Go back to your bedchamber, sweet Jonquil,” he whispered.
22639	“Lock yourself in, you’ll be safer there.
22640	I’ll come for you when the battle’s done.
22641	” Someone will come for me, Sansa thought, but will it be you, or will it be Ser Ilyn? For a mad moment she thought of begging Dontos to defend her.
22642	He had been a knight too, trained with the sword and sworn to defend the weak.
22643	No.
22644	He has not the courage, or the skill.
22645	I would only be killing him as well.
22646	It took all the strength she had in her to walk slowly from the Queen’s Ballroom when she wanted so badly to run.
22647	When she reached the steps, she did run, up and around until she was breathless and dizzy.
22648	One of the guards knocked into her on the stair.
22649	A jeweled wine cup and a pair of silver candlesticks spilled out of the crimson cloak he’d wrapped them in and went clattering down the steps.
22650	He hurried after them, paying Sansa no mind once he decided she was not going to try and take his loot.
22651	Her bedchamber was black as pitch.
22652	Sansa barred the door and fumbled through the dark to the window.
22653	When she ripped back the drapes, her breath caught in her throat.
22654	The southern sky was aswirl with glowing, shifting colors, the reflections of the great fires that burned below.
22655	Baleful green tides moved against the bellies of the clouds, and pools of orange light spread out across the heavens.
22656	The reds and yellows of common flame warred against the emeralds and jades of wildfire, each color flaring and then fading, birthing armies of short-lived shadows to die again an instant later.
22657	Green dawns gave way to orange dusks in half a heartbeat.
22658	The air itself smelled burnt, the way a soup kettle sometimes smelled if it was left on the fire too long and all the soup boiled away.
22659	Embers drifted through the night air like swarms of fireflies.
22660	Sansa backed away from the window, retreating toward the safety of her bed.
22661	I’ll go to sleep, she told herself, and when I wake it will be a new day, and the sky will be blue again.
22662	458 The fighting will be done and someone will tell me whether I’m to live or die.
22663	“Lady,” she whimpered softly, wondering if she would meet her wolf again when she was dead.
22664	Then something stirred behind her, and a hand reached out of the dark and grabbed her wrist.
22665	Sansa opened her mouth to scream, but another hand clamped down over her face, smothering her.
22666	His fingers were rough and callused, and sticky with blood.
22667	“Little bird.
22668	I knew you’d come.
22669	” The voice was a drunken rasp.
22670	Outside, a swirling lance of jade light spit at the stars, filling the room with green glare.
22671	She saw him for a moment, all black and green, the blood on his face dark as tar, his eyes glowing like a dog’s in the sudden glare.
22672	Then the light faded and he was only a hulking darkness in a stained white cloak.
22673	“If you scream I’ll kill you.
22674	Believe that.
22675	” He took his hand from her mouth.
22676	Her breath was coming ragged.
22677	The Hound had a flagon of wine on her bedside table.
22678	He took a long pull.
22679	“Don’t you want to ask who’s winning the battle, little bird?”Who?” she said, too frightened to defy him.
22680	The Hound laughed.
22681	“I only know who’s lost.
22682	Me.
22683	” He is drunker than I’ve ever seen him.
22684	He was sleeping in my bed.
22685	What does he want here? “What have you lost?”All.
22686	” The burnt half of his face was a mask of dried blood.
22687	“Bloody dwarf.
22688	Should have killed him.
22689	Years ago.
22690	”He’s dead, they say.
22691	”Dead? No.
22692	Bugger that.
22693	I don’t want him dead.
22694	” He cast the empty flagon aside.
22695	“I want him burned.
22696	If the gods are good, they’ll burn him, but I won’t be here to see.
22697	I’m going.
22698	”Going?” She tried to wriggle free, but his grasp was iron.
22699	“The little bird repeats whatever she hears.
22700	Going, yes.
22701	”Where will you go?”Away from here.
22702	Away from the fires.
22703	Go out the Iron Gate, I suppose.
22704	North somewhere, anywhere.
22705	”You won’t get out,” Sansa said.
22706	“The queen’s closed up Maegor’s, and the city gates are shut as well.
22707	”Not to me.
22708	I have the white cloak.
22709	And I have this.
22710	” He patted the pommel of his sword.
22711	“The man who tries to stop me is a dead man.
22712	Unless he’s on fire.
22713	” He laughed bitterly.
22714	“Why did you come here?”You promised me a song, little bird.
22715	Have you forgotten?” She didn’t know what he meant.
22716	She couldn’t sing for him now, here, with the sky aswirl with fire and men dying in their hundreds and their thousands.
22717	“I can’t,” she said.
22718	“Let me go, you’re scaring me.
22719	”Everything scares you.
22720	Look at me.
22721	Look at me.
22722	” The blood masked the worst of his scars, but his eyes were white and wide and terrifying.
22723	The burnt corner of his mouth twitched and twitched again.
22724	Sansa could smell him:: a stink of sweat and sour wine and stale vomit, and over it all the reek of blood, blood, blood.
22725	“I could keep you safe,” he rasped.
22726	“They’re all afraid of me.
22727	No one would hurt you again, or I’d kill them.
22728	” He yanked her closer, and for a moment she thought he meant to kiss her.
22729	He was too strong to fight.
22730	She closed her eyes, wanting it to be over, but nothing 459 happened.
22731	“Still can’t bear to look, can you?” she heard him say.
22732	He gave her arm a hard wrench, pulling her around and shoving her down onto the bed.
22733	“I’ll have that song.
22734	Florian and Jonquil, you said.
22735	” His dagger was out, poised at her throat.
22736	“Sing, little bird.
22737	Sing for your little life.
22738	” Her throat was dry and tight with fear, and every song she had ever known had fled from her mind.
22739	Please don’t kill me, she wanted to scream, please don’t.
22740	She could feel him twisting the point, pushing it into her throat, and she almost closed her eyes again, but then she remembered.
22741	It was not the song of Florian and Jonquil, but it was a song.
22742	Her voice sounded small and thin and tremulous in her ears.
22743	Gentle Mother, font of mercy, save our sons from war, we pray, stay the swords and stay the arrows, let them know a better day.
22744	Gentle Mother, strength of women, help our daughters through this fray, soothe the wrath and tame the fury, teach us all a kinder way.
22745	She had forgotten the other verses.
22746	When her voice trailed off, she feared he might kill her, but after a moment the Hound took the blade from her throat, never speaking.
22747	Some instinct made her lift her hand and cup his cheek with her fingers.
22748	The room was too dark for her to see him, but she could feel the stickiness of the blood, and a wetness that was not blood.
22749	“Little bird,” he said once more, his voice raw and harsh as steel on stone.
22750	Then he rose from the bed.
22751	Sansa heard cloth ripping, followed by the softer sound of retreating footsteps.
22752	When she crawled out of bed, long moments later, she was alone.
22753	She found his cloak on the floor, twisted up tight, the white wool stained by blood and fire.
22754	The sky outside was darker by then, with only a few pale green ghosts dancing against the stars.
22755	A chill wind was blowing, banging the shutters.
22756	Sansa was cold.
22757	She shook out the torn cloak and huddled beneath it on the floor, shivering.
22758	How long she stayed there she could not have said, but after a time she heard a bell ringing, far off across the city.
22759	The sound was a deep-throated bronze booming, coming faster with each knell.
22760	Sansa was wondering what it might mean when a second bell joined in, and a third, their voices calling across the hills and hollows, the alleys and towers, to every corner of King’s Landing.
22761	She threw off the cloak and went to her window.
22762	The first faint hint of dawn was visible in the east, and the Red Keep’s own bells were ringing now, joining in the swelling river of sound that flowed from the seven crystal towers of the Great Sept of Baelor.
22763	They had rung the bells when King Robert died, she remembered, but this was different, no slow dolorous death knell but a joyful thunder.
22764	She could hear men shouting in the streets as well, and something that could only be cheers.
22765	It was Ser Dontos who brought her the word.
22766	He staggered through her open door, wrapped her in his flabby arms, and whirled her around and around the room, whooping so incoherently that Sansa understood not a word of it.
22767	He was as drunk as the Hound had been, but in him it was a dancing happy drunk.
22768	She was breathless and dizzy when he let her down.
22769	“What is it?” She clutched at a bedpost.
22770	“What’s happened? Tell me!”It’s done! Done! Done! The city is saved.
22771	Lord Stannis is dead, Lord Stannis is fled, no one knows, no one cares, his host is broken, the danger’s done.
22772	Slaughtered, scattered, or gone over, they say.
22773	Oh, the bright banners! The banners, Jonquil, the banners! Do you have any wine? We ought to drink to this day, yes.
22774	It means you’re safe, don’t you see?”Tell me what’s happened!” Sansa shook him.
22775	Ser Dontos laughed and hopped from one leg to the other, almost falling.
22776	“They came up through the ashes while the river was burning.
22777	The river, Stannis was neck-deep in the river, 460 and they took him from the rear.
22778	Oh, to be a knight again, to have been part of it! His own men hardly fought, they say.
22779	Some ran but more bent the knee and went over, shouting for Lord Renly! What must Stannis have thought when he heard that? I had it from Osney Kettleblack who had it from Ser Osmund, but Ser Balon’s back now and his men say the same, and the gold cloaks as well.
22780	We’re delivered, sweetling! They came up the roseroad and along the riverbank, through all the fields Stannis had burned, the ashes puffing up around their boots and turning all their armor grey, but oh! the banners must have been bright, the golden rose and golden lion and all the others, the Marbrand tree and the Rowan, Tarly’s huntsman and Redwyne’s grapes and Lady Oakheart’s leaf.
22781	All the westermen, all the power of Highgarden and Casterly Rock! Lord Tywin himself had their right wing on the north side of the river, with Randyll Tarly commanding the center and Mace Tyrell the left, but the vanguard won the fight.
22782	They plunged through Stannis like a lance through a pumpkin, every man of them howling like some demon in steel.
22783	And do you know who led the vanguard? Do you? Do you? Do you?”Robb?” It was too much to be hoped, but.
22784	“It was Lord Renly! Lord Renly in his green armor, with the fires shimmering off his golden antlers! Lord Renly with his tall spear in his hand! They say he killed Ser Guyard Morrigen himself in single combat, and a dozen other great knights as well.
22785	It was Renly, it was Renly, it was Renly! Oh! the banners, darling Sansa! Oh! to be a knight!” CHAPTER SIXTY-THREE DAENERYS She was breaking her fast on a bowl of cold shrimp-and-persimmon soup when Irri brought her a Qartheen gown, an airy confection of ivory samite patterned with seed pearls.
22786	“Take it away,” Dany said.
22787	“The docks are no place for lady’s finery.
22788	” If the Milk Men thought her such a savage, she would dress the part for them.
22789	When she went to the stables, she wore faded sandsilk pants and woven grass sandals.
22790	Her small breasts moved freely beneath a painted Dothraki vest, and a curved dagger hung from her medallion belt.
22791	Jhiqui had braided her hair Dothraki-fashion, and fastened a silver bell to the end of the braid.
22792	“I have won no victories,” she tried telling her handmaid when the bell tinkled softly.
22793	Jhiqui disagreed.
22794	“You burned the maegi in their house of dust and sent their souls to hell.
22795	” That was Drogon’s victory, not mine, Dany wanted to say, but she held her tongue.
22796	The Dothraki would esteem her all the more for a few bells in her hair.
22797	She chimed as she mounted her silver mare, and again with every stride, but neither Ser Jorah nor her bloodriders made mention of it.
22798	To guard her people and her dragons in her absence, she chose Rakharo.
22799	Jhogo and Aggo would ride with her to the waterfront.
22800	They left the marble palaces and fragrant gardens behind and made their way through a poorer part of the city where modest brick houses turned blind walls to the street.
22801	There were fewer horses and camels to be seen, and a dearth of palanquins, but the streets teemed with children, beggars, and skinny dogs the color of sand.
22802	Pale men in dusty linen skirts stood beneath arched doorways to watch them pass.
22803	They know who I am, and they do not love me.
22804	Dany could tell from the way they looked at her.
22805	Ser Jorah would sooner have tucked her inside her palanquin, safely hidden behind silken curtains, but she refused him.
22806	She had reclined too long on satin cushions, letting oxen bear her hither and yon.
22807	At least when she rode she felt as though she was getting somewhere.
22808	461 It was not by choice that she sought the waterfront.
22809	She was fleeing again.
22810	Her whole life had been one long flight, it seemed.
22811	She had begun running in her mother’s womb, and never once stopped.
22812	How often had she and Viserys stolen away in the black of night, a bare step ahead of the Usurper’s hired knives? But it was run or die.
22813	Xaro had learned that Pyat Pree was gathering the surviving warlocks together to work ill on her.
22814	Dany had laughed when he told her.
22815	“Was it not you who told me warlocks were no more than old soldiers, vainly boasting of forgotten deeds and lost prowess?” Xaro looked troubled.
22816	“And so it was, then.
22817	But now? I am less certain.
22818	It is said that the glass candles are burning in the house of Urrathon Night-Walker, that have not burned in a hundred years.
22819	Ghost grass grows in the Garden of Gehane, phantom tortoises have been seen carrying messages between the windowless houses on Warlock’s Way, and all the rats in the city are chewing off their tails.
22820	The wife of Mathos Mallarawan, who once mocked a warlock’s drab moth-eaten robe, has gone mad and will wear no clothes at all.
22821	Even freshwashed silks make her feel as though a thousand insects were crawling on her skin.
22822	And Blind Sybassion the Eater of Eyes can see again, or so his slaves do swear.
22823	A man must wonder.
22824	” He sighed.
22825	“These are strange times in Qarth.
22826	And strange times are bad for trade.
22827	It grieves me to say so, yet it might be best if you left Qarth entirely, and sooner rather than later.
22828	” Xaro stroked her fingers reassuringly.
22829	“You need not go alone, though.
22830	You have seen dark visions in the Palace of Dust, but Xaro has dreamed brighter dreams.
22831	I see you happily abed, with our child at your breast.
22832	Sail with me around the Jade Sea, and we can yet make it so! It is not too late.
22833	Give me a son, my sweet song of joy!” Give you a dragon, you mean.
22834	“I will not wed you, Xaro.
22835	” His face had grown cold at that.
22836	“Then go.
22837	”But where?”Somewhere far from here.
22838	” Well, perhaps it was time.
22839	The people of her khalasar had welcomed the chance to recover from the ravages of the red waste, but now that they were plump and rested once again, they began to grow unruly.
22840	Dothraki were not accustomed to staying long in one place.
22841	They were a warrior people, not made for cities.
22842	Perhaps she had lingered in Qarth too long, seduced by its comforts and its beauties.
22843	It was a city that always promised more than it would give you, it seemed to her, and her welcome here had turned sour since the House of the Undying had collapsed in a great gout of smoke and flame.
22844	Overnight the Qartheen had come to remember that dragons were dangerous.
22845	No longer did they vie with each other to give her gifts.
22846	Instead the Tourmaline Brotherhood had called openly for her expulsion, and the Ancient Guild of Spicers for her death.
22847	It was all Xaro could do to keep the Thirteen from joining them.
22848	But where am I to go? Ser Jorah proposed that they journey farther east, away from her enemies in the Seven Kingdoms.
22849	Her bloodriders would sooner have returned to their great grass sea, even if it meant braving the red waste again.
22850	Dany herself had toyed with the idea of settling in Vaes Tolorro until her dragons grew great and strong.
22851	But her heart was full of doubts.
22852	Each of these felt wrong, somehow.
22853	and even when she decided where to go, the question of how she would get there remained troublesome.
22854	Xaro Xhoan Daxos would be no help to her, she knew that now.
22855	For all his professions of devotion, he was playing his own game, not unlike Pyat Pree.
22856	The night he asked her to leave, Dany had begged one last favor of him.
22857	“An army, is it?” Xaro asked.
22858	“A kettle of gold? A galley, perhaps?” Dany blushed.
22859	She hated begging.
22860	“A ship, yes.
22861	” 462 Xaro’s eyes had glittered as brightly as the jewels in his nose.
22862	“I am a trader, Khaleesi.
22863	So perhaps we should speak no more of giving, but rather of trade.
22864	For one of your dragons, you shall have ten of the finest ships in my fleet.
22865	You need only say that one sweet word.
22866	”No,” she said.
22867	“Alas,” Xaro sobbed, “that was not the word I meant.
22868	”Would you ask a mother to sell one of her children?”Whyever not? They can always make more.
22869	Mothers sell their children every day.
22870	”Not the Mother of Dragons.
22871	”Not even for twenty ships?”Not for a hundred.
22872	” His mouth curled downward.
22873	“I do not have a hundred.
22874	But you have three dragons.
22875	Grant me one, for all my kindnesses.
22876	You will still have two and thirty ships as well.
22877	” Thirty ships would be enough to land a small army on the shore of Westeros.
22878	But I do not have a small army.
22879	“How many ships do you own, Xaro?”Eighty-three, if one does not count my pleasure barge.
22880	”And your colleagues in the Thirteen?”Among us all, perhaps a thousand.
22881	”And the Spicers and the Tourmaline Brotherhood?”Their trifling fleets are of no account.
22882	”Even so,” she said, “tell me.
22883	”Twelve or thirteen hundred for the Spicers.
22884	No more than eight hundred for the Brotherhood.
22885	”And the Asshai’i, the Braavosi, the Summer Islanders, the Ibbenese, and all the other peoples who sail the great salt sea, how many ships do they have? All together?”Many and more,” he said irritably.
22886	“What does this matter?”I am trying to set a price on one of the three living dragons in the world.
22887	” Dany smiled at him sweetly.
22888	“It seems to me that one-third of all the ships in the world would be fair.
22889	” Xaro’s tears ran down his cheeks on either side of his jewel-encrusted nose.
22890	“Did I not warn you not to enter the Palace of Dust? This is the very thing I feared.
22891	The whispers of the warlocks have made you as mad as Mallarawan’s wife.
22892	A third of all the ships in the world? Pah.
22893	Pah, I say.
22894	Pah.
22895	” Dany had not seen him since.
22896	His seneschal brought her messages, each cooler than the last.
22897	She must quit his house.
22898	He was done feeding her and her people.
22899	He demanded the return of his gifts, which she had accepted in bad faith.
22900	Her only consolation was that at least she’d had the great good sense not to marry him.
22901	The warlocks whispered of three treasons.
22902	once for blood and once for gold and once for love.
22903	The first traitor was surely Mirri Maz Duur, who had murdered Khal Drogo and their unborn son to avenge her people.
22904	Could Pyat Pree and Xaro Xhoan Daxos be the second and the third? She did not think so.
22905	What Pyat did was not for gold, and Xaro had never truly loved her.
22906	The streets grew emptier as they passed through a district given over to gloomy stone warehouses.
22907	Aggo went before her and Jhogo behind, leaving Ser Jorah Mormont at her side.
22908	Her bell rang softly, and Dany found her thoughts returning to the Palace of Dust once more, as the tongue returns to a space left by a missing tooth.
22909	Child of three, they had called her, 463 daughter of death, slayer of lies, bride of fire.
22910	So many threes.
22911	Three fires, three mounts to ride, three treasons.
22912	“The dragon has three heads,” she sighed.
22913	“Do you know what that means, Jorah?”Your Grace? The sigil of House Targaryen is a three-headed dragon, red on black.
22914	”I know that.
22915	But there are no three-headed dragons.
22916	”The three heads were Aegon and his sisters.
22917	”Visenya and Rhaenys,” she recalled.
22918	“I am descended from Aegon and Rhaenys through their son Aenys and their grandson Jaehaerys.
22919	”Blue lips speak only lies, isn’t that what Xaro told you? Why do you care what the warlocks whispered? All they wanted was to suck the life from you, you know that now.
22920	”Perhaps,” she said reluctantly.
22921	“Yet the things I saw.
22922	”A dead man in the prow of a ship, a blue rose, a banquet of blood.
22923	what does any of it mean, Khaleesi? A mummer’s dragon, you said.
22924	What is a mummer’s dragon, pray?”A cloth dragon on poles,” Dany explained.
22925	“Mummers use them in their follies, to give the heroes something to fight.
22926	” Ser Jorah frowned.
22927	Dany could not let it go.
22928	“His is the song of ice and fire, my brother said.
22929	I’m certain it was my brother.
22930	Not Viserys, Rhaegar.
22931	He had a harp with silver strings.
22932	” Ser Jorah’s frown deepened until his eyebrows came together.
22933	“Prince Rhaegar played such a harp,” he conceded.
22934	“You saw him?” She nodded.
22935	“There was a woman in a bed with a babe at her breast.
22936	My brother said the babe was the prince that was promised and told her to name him Aegon.
22937	”Prince Aegon was Rhaegar’s heir by Elia of Dorne,” Ser Jorah said.
22938	“But if he was this prince that was promised, the promise was broken along with his skull when the Lannisters dashed his head against a wall.
22939	”I remember,” Dany said sadly.
22940	“They murdered Rhaegar’s daughter as well, the little princess.
22941	Rhaenys, she was named, like Aegon’s sister.
22942	There was no Visenya, but he said the dragon has three heads.
22943	What is the song of ice and fire?”It’s no song I’ve ever heard.
22944	”I went to the warlocks hoping for answers, but instead they’ve left me with a hundred new questions.
22945	” By then there were people in the streets once more.
22946	“Make way,” Aggo shouted, while Jhogo sniffed at the air suspiciously.
22947	“I smell it, Khaleesi,” he called.
22948	“The poison water.
22949	” The Dothraki distrusted the sea and all that moved upon it.
22950	Water that a horse could not drink was water they wanted no part of.
22951	They will learn, Dany resolved.
22952	I braved their sea with Khal Drogo.
22953	Now they can brave mine.
22954	Qarth was one of the world’s great ports, its great sheltered harbor a riot of color and clangor and strange smells.
22955	Winesinks, warehouses, and gaming dens lined the streets, cheek by jowl with cheap brothels and the temples of peculiar gods.
22956	Cutpurses, cutthroats, spellsellers, and moneychangers mingled with every crowd.
22957	The waterfront was one great marketplace where the buying and selling went on all day and all night, and goods might be had for a fraction of what they cost at the bazaar, if a man did not ask where they came from.
22958	Wizened old women bent like hunchbacks sold flavored waters and goat’s milk from glazed ceramic jugs strapped to their shoulders.
22959	Seamen from half a hundred nations wandered 464 amongst the stalls, drinking spiced liquors and trading jokes in queer-sounding tongues.
22960	The air smelled of salt and frying fish, of hot tar and honey, of incense and oil and sperm.
22961	Aggo gave an urchin a copper for a skewer of honey-roasted mice and nibbled them as he rode.
22962	Jhogo bought a handful of fat white cherries.
22963	Elsewhere they saw beautiful bronze daggers for sale, dried squids and carved onyx, a potent magical elixir made of virgin’s milk and shade of the evening, even dragon’s eggs which looked suspiciously like painted rocks.
22964	As they passed the long stone quays reserved for the ships of the Thirteen, she saw chests of saffron, frankincense, and pepper being off-loaded from Xaro’s ornate Vermillion Kiss.
22965	Beside her, casks of wine, bales of sourleaf, and pallets of striped hides were being trundled up the gangplank onto the Bride in Azure, to sail on the evening tide.
22966	Farther along, a crowd had gathered around the Spicer galley Sunblaze to bid on slaves.
22967	It was well known that the cheapest place to buy a slave was right off the ship, and the banners floating from her masts proclaimed that the Sunblaze had just arrived from Astapor on Slaver’s Bay.
22968	Dany would get no help from the Thirteen, the Tourmaline Brotherhood, or the Ancient Guild of Spicers.
22969	She rode her silver past several miles of their quays, docks, and storehouses, all the way out to the far end of the horseshoe-shaped harbor where the ships from the Summer Islands, Westeros, and the Nine Free Cities were permitted to dock.
22970	She dismounted beside a gaming pit where a basilisk was tearing a big red dog to pieces amidst a shouting ring of sailors.
22971	“Aggo, Jhogo, you will guard the horses while Ser Jorah and I speak to the captains.
22972	”As you say, Khaleesi.
22973	We will watch you as you go.
22974	” It was good to hear men speaking Valyrian once more, and even the Common Tongue, Dany thought as they approached the first ship.
22975	Sailors, dockworkers, and merchants alike gave way before her, not knowing what to make of this slim young girl with silver-gold hair who dressed in the Dothraki fashion and walked with a knight at her side.
22976	Despite the heat of the day, Ser Jorah wore his green wool surcoat over chain-mail, the black bear of Mormont sewn on his chest.
22977	But neither her beauty nor his size and strength would serve with the men whose ships they needed.
22978	“You require passage for a hundred Dothraki, all their horses, yourself and this knight, and three dragons?” said the captain of the great cog Ardent Friend before he walked away laughing.
22979	When she told a Lyseni on the Trumpeteer that she was Daenerys Stormborn, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, he gave her a deadface look and said, “Aye, and I’m Lord Tywin Lannister and shit gold every night.
22980	” The cargomaster of the Myrish galley Silken Spirit opined that dragons were too dangerous at sea, where any stray breath of flame might set the rigging afire.
22981	The owner of Lord Faro’s Belly would risk dragons, but not Dothraki.
22982	“I’ll have no such godless savages in my Belly, I’ll not.
22983	” The two brothers who captained the sister ships Quicksilver and Greyhound seemed sympathetic and invited them into the cabin for a glass of Arbor red.
22984	They were so courteous that Dany was hopeful for a time, but in the end the price they asked was far beyond her means, and might have been beyond Xaro’s.
22985	Pinchbottom Petto and Sloe-Eyed Maid were too small for her needs, Bravo was bound for the Jade Sea, and Magister Manolo scarce looked seaworthy.
22986	As they made their way toward the next quay, Ser Jorah laid a hand against the small of her back.
22987	“Your Grace.
22988	You are being followed.
22989	No, do not turn.
22990	” He guided her gently toward a brass-seller’s booth.
22991	“This is a noble work, my queen,” he proclaimed loudly, lifting a large platter for her inspection.
22992	“See how it shines in the sun?” 465 The brass was polished to a high sheen.
22993	Dany could see her face in it.
22994	and when Ser Jorah angled it to the right, she could see behind her.
22995	“I see a fat brown man and an older man with a staff.
22996	Which is it?”Both of them,” Ser Jorah said.
22997	“They have been following us since we left Quicksilver.
22998	” The ripples in the brass stretched the strangers queerly, making one man seem long and gaunt, the other immensely squat and broad.
22999	“A most excellent brass, great lady,” the merchant exclaimed.
23000	“Bright as the sun! And for the Mother of Dragons, only thirty honors.
23001	” The platter was worth no more than three.
23002	“Where are my guards?” Dany declared.
23003	“This man is trying to rob me!” For Jorah, she lowered her voice and spoke in the Common Tongue.
23004	“They may not mean me ill.
23005	Men have looked at women since time began, perhaps it is no more than that.
23006	” The brass-seller ignored their whispers.
23007	“Thirty? Did I say thirty? Such a fool I am.
23008	The price is twenty honors.
23009	”All the brass in this booth is not worth twenty honors,” Dany told him as she studied the reflections.
23010	The old man had the look of Westeros about him, and the brown-skinned one must weigh twenty stone.
23011	The Usurper offered a lordship to the man who kills me, and these two are far from home.
23012	Or could they be creatures of the warlocks, meant to take me unawares? “Ten, Khaleesi, because you are so lovely.
23013	Use it for a looking glass.
23014	Only brass this fine could capture such beauty.
23015	”It might serve to carry nightsoil.
23016	If you threw it away, I might pick it up, so long as I did not need to stoop.
23017	But pay for it?” Dany shoved the platter back into his hands.
23018	“Worms have crawled up your nose and eaten your wits.
23019	”Eight honors,” he cried.
23020	“My wives will beat me and call me fool, but I am a helpless child in your hands.
23021	Come, eight, that is less than it is worth.
23022	”What do I need with dull brass when Xaro Xhoan Daxos feeds me off plates of gold?” As she turned to walk off, Dany let her glance sweep over the strangers.
23023	The brown man was near as wide as he’d looked in the platter, with a gleaming bald head and the smooth cheeks of a eunuch.
23024	A long curving arakh was thrust through the sweat-stained yellow silk of his bellyband.
23025	Above the silk, he was naked but for an absurdly tiny iron-studded vest.
23026	Old scars crisscrossed his tree-trunk arms, huge chest, and massive belly, pale against his nut-brown skin.
23027	The other man wore a traveler’s cloak of undyed wool, the hood thrown back.
23028	Long white hair fell to his shoulders, and a silky white beard covered the lower half of his face.
23029	He leaned his weight on a hardwood staff as tall as he was.
23030	Only fools would stare so openly if they meant me harm.
23031	All the same, it might be prudent to head back toward Jhogo and Aggo.
23032	“The old man does not wear a sword,” she said to Jorah in the Common Tongue as she drew him away.
23033	The brass merchant came hopping after them.
23034	“Five honors, for five it is yours, it was meant for you.
23035	” Ser Jorah said, “A hardwood staff can crack a skull as well as any mace.
23036	”Four! I know you want it!” He danced in front of them, scampering backward as he thrust the platter at their faces.
23037	“Do they follow?”Lift that up a little higher,” the knight told the merchant.
23038	“Yes.
23039	The old man pretends to linger at a potter’s stall, but the brown one has eyes only for you.
23040	” 466 “Two honors! Two! Two!” The merchant was panting heavily from the effort of running backward.
23041	“Pay him before he kills himself,” Dany told Ser Jorah, wondering what she was going to do with a huge brass platter.
23042	She turned back as he reached for his coins, intending to put an end to this mummer’s farce.
23043	The blood of the dragon would not be herded through the bazaar by an old man and a fat eunuch.
23044	A Qartheen stepped into her path.
23045	“Mother of Dragons, for you.
23046	” He knelt and thrust a jewel box into her face.
23047	Dany took it almost by reflex.
23048	The box was carved wood, its mother-of-pearl lid inlaid with jasper and chalcedony.
23049	“You are too generous.
23050	” She opened it.
23051	Within was a glittering green scarab carved from onyx and emerald.
23052	Beautiful, she thought.
23053	This will help pay for our passage.
23054	As she reached inside the box, the man said, “I am so sorry,” but she hardly heard.
23055	The scarab unfolded with a hiss.
23056	Dany caught a glimpse of a malign black face, almost human, and an arched tail dripping venom.
23057	and then the box flew from her hand in pieces, turning end over end.
23058	Sudden pain twisted her fingers.
23059	As she cried out and clutched her hand, the brass merchant let out a shriek, a woman screamed, and suddenly the Qartheen were shouting and pushing each other aside.
23060	Ser Jorah slammed past her, and Dany stumbled to one knee.
23061	She heard the hiss again.
23062	The old man drove the butt of his staff into the ground, Aggo came riding through an eggseller’s stall and vaulted from his saddle, Jhogo’s whip cracked overhead, Ser Jorah slammed the eunuch over the head with the brass platter, sailors and whores and merchants were fleeing or shouting or both.
23063	“Your Grace, a thousand pardons.
23064	” The old man knelt.
23065	“It’s dead.
23066	Did I break your hand?” She closed her fingers, wincing.
23067	“I don’t think so.
23068	”I had to knock it away,” he started, but her bloodriders were on him before he could finish.
23069	Aggo kicked his staff away and Jhogo seized him round the shoulders, forced him to his knees, and pressed a dagger to his throat.
23070	“Khaleesi, we saw him strike you.
23071	Would you see the color of his blood?”Release him.
23072	” Dany climbed to her feet.
23073	“Look at the bottom of his staff, blood of my blood.
23074	” Ser Jorah had been shoved off his feet by the eunuch.
23075	She ran between them as arakh and longsword both came flashing from their sheaths.
23076	“Put down your steel! Stop it!”Your Grace?” Mormont lowered his sword only an inch.
23077	“These men attacked you.
23078	”They were defending me.
23079	” Dany snapped her hand to shake the sting from her fingers.
23080	“It was the other one, the Qartheen.
23081	” When she looked around he was gone.
23082	“He was a Sorrowful Man.
23083	There was a manticore in that jewel box he gave me.
23084	This man knocked it out of my hand.
23085	” The brass merchant was still rolling on the ground.
23086	She went to him and helped him to his feet.
23087	“Were you stung?”No, good lady,” he said, shaking, “or else I would be dead.
23088	But it touched me, aieeee, when it fell from the box it landed on my arm.
23089	” He had soiled himself, she saw, and no wonder.
23090	She gave him a silver for his trouble and sent him on his way before she turned back to the old man with the white beard.
23091	“Who is it that I owe my life to?”You owe me nothing, Your Grace.
23092	I am called Arstan, though Belwas named me Whitebeard on the voyage here.
23093	” Though Jhogo had released him the old man remained on 467 one knee.
23094	Aggo picked up his staff, turned it over, cursed softly in Dothraki, scraped the remains of the manticore off on a stone, and handed it back.
23095	“And who is Belwas?” she asked.
23096	The huge brown eunuch swaggered forward, sheathing his arakh.
23097	“I am Belwas.
23098	Strong Belwas they name me in the fighting pits of Meereen.
23099	Never did I lose.
23100	” He slapped his belly, covered with scars.
23101	“I let each man cut me once, before I kill him.
23102	Count the cuts and you will know how many Strong Belwas has slain.
23103	” Dany had no need to count his scars:: there were many, she could see at a glance.
23104	“And why are you here, Strong Belwas?”From Meereen I am sold to Qohor, and then to Pentos and the fat man with sweet stink in his hair.
23105	He it was who send Strong Belwas back across the sea, and old Whitebeard to serve him.
23106	” The fat man with sweet stink in his hair.
23107	“Illyrio?” she said.
23108	“You were sent by Magister Illyrio?”We were, Your Grace,” old Whitebeard replied.
23109	“The Magister begs your kind indulgence for sending us in his stead, but he cannot sit a horse as he did in his youth, and sea travel upsets his digestion.
23110	” Earlier he had spoken in the Valyrian of the Free Cities, but now he changed to the Common Tongue.
23111	“I regret if we caused you alarm.
23112	If truth be told, we were not certain, we expected someone more.
23113	more.
23114	”Regal?” Dany laughed.
23115	She had no dragon with her, and her raiment was hardly queenly.
23116	“You speak the Common Tongue well, Arstan.
23117	Are you of Westeros?”I am.
23118	I was born on the Dornish Marches, Your Grace.
23119	As a boy I squired for a knight of Lord Swann’s household.
23120	” He held the tall staff upright beside him like a lance in need of a banner.
23121	“Now I squire for Belwas.
23122	”A bit old for such, aren’t you?” Ser Jorah had shouldered his way to her side, holding the brass platter awkwardly under his arm.
23123	Belwas’s hard head had left it badly bent.
23124	“Not too old to serve my liege, Lord Mormont.
23125	”You know me as well?”I saw you fight a time or two.
23126	At Lannisport where you near unhorsed the Kingslayer.
23127	And on Pyke, there as well.
23128	You do not recall, Lord Mormont?” Ser Jorah frowned.
23129	“Your face seems familiar, but there were hundreds at Lannisport and thousands on Pyke.
23130	And I am no lord.
23131	Bear Island was taken from me.
23132	I am but a knight.
23133	”A knight of my Queensguard.
23134	” Dany took his arm.
23135	“And my true friend and good counselor.
23136	” She studied Arstan’s face.
23137	He had a great dignity to him, a quiet strength she liked.
23138	“Rise, Arstan Whitebeard.
23139	Be welcome, Strong Belwas.
23140	Ser Jorah you know.
23141	Ko Aggo and Ko Jhogo are blood of my blood.
23142	They crossed the red waste with me, and saw my dragons born.
23143	”Horse boys.
23144	” Belwas grinned toothily.
23145	“Belwas has killed many horse boys in the fighting pits.
23146	They jingle when they die.
23147	” Aggo’s arakh leapt to his hand.
23148	“Never have I killed a fat brown man.
23149	Belwas will be the first.
23150	”Sheath your steel, blood of my blood,” said Dany, “this man comes to serve me.
23151	Belwas, you will accord all respect to my people, or you will leave my service sooner than you’d wish, and with more scars than when you came.
23152	” 468 The gap-toothed smile faded from the giant’s broad brown face, replaced by a confused scowl.
23153	Men did not often threaten Belwas, it would seem, and less so girls a third his size.
23154	Dany gave him a smile, to take a bit of the sting from the rebuke.
23155	“Now tell me, what would Magister Illyrio have of me, that he would send you all the way from Pentos?”He would have dragons,” said Belwas gruffly, “and the girl who makes them.
23156	He would have you.
23157	”Belwas has the truth of us, Your Grace,” said Arstan.
23158	“We were told to find you and bring you back to Pentos.
23159	The Seven Kingdoms have need of you.
23160	Robert the Usurper is dead, and the realm bleeds.
23161	When we set sail from Pentos there were four kings in the land, and no justice to be had.
23162	” Joy bloomed in her heart, but Dany kept it from her face.
23163	“I have three dragons,” she said, “and more than a hundred in my khalasar, with all their goods and horses.
23164	”It is no matter,” boomed Belwas.
23165	“We take all.
23166	The fat man hires three ships for his little silverhair queen.
23167	”It is so, Your Grace,” Arstan Whitebeard said.
23168	“The great cog Saduleon is berthed at the end of the quay, and the galleys Summer Sun and Joso’s Prank are anchored beyond the breakwater.
23169	” Three heads has the dragon, Dany thought, wondering.
23170	“I shall tell my people to make ready to depart at once.
23171	But the ships that bring me home must bear different names.
23172	”As you wish,” said Arstan.
23173	“What names would you prefer?”Vhagar,” Daenerys told him.
23174	“Meraxes.
23175	And Balerion.
23176	Paint the names on their hulls in golden letters three feet high, Arstan.
23177	I want every man who sees them to know the dragons are returned.
23178	” CHAPTER SIXTY-FOUR ARYA The heads had been dipped in tar to slow the rot.
23179	Every morning when Arya went to the well to draw fresh water for Roose Bolton’s basin, she had to pass beneath them.
23180	They faced outward, so she never saw their faces, but she liked to pretend that one of them was Joffrey’s.
23181	She tried to picture how his pretty face would look dipped in tar.
23182	If I was a crow I could fly down and peck off his stupid fat pouty lips.
23183	The heads never lacked for attendants.
23184	The carrion crows wheeled about the gatehouse in raucous unkindness and quarreled upon the ramparts over every eye, screaming and cawing at each other and taking to the air whenever a sentry passed along the battlements.
23185	Sometimes the maester’s ravens joined the feast as well, flapping down from the rookery on wide black wings.
23186	When the ravens came the crows would scatter, only to return the moment the larger birds were gone.
23187	Do the ravens remember Maester Tothmure? Arya wondered.
23188	Are they sad for him? When they quork at him, do they wonder why he doesn’t answer? Perhaps the dead could speak to them in some secret tongue the living could not hear.
23189	Tothmure had been sent to the axe for dispatching birds to Casterly Rock and King’s Landing the night Harrenhal had fallen, Lucan the armorer for making weapons for the Lannisters, Goodwife Harra for telling Lady Whent’s household to serve them, the steward for giving Lord Tywin the keys to the treasure vault.
23190	The cook was spared (some said because he’d made the weasel soup), but stocks were hammered together for pretty Pia and the other 469 women who’d shared their favors with Lannister soldiers.
23191	Stripped and shaved, they were left in the middle ward beside the bear pit, free for the use of any man who wanted them.
23192	Three Frey men-at-arms were using them that morning as Arya went to the well.
23193	She tried not to look, but she could hear the men laughing.
23194	The pail was very heavy once full.
23195	She was turning to bring it back to Kingspyre when Goodwife Amabel seized her arm.
23196	The water went sloshing over the side onto Amabel’s legs.
23197	“You did that on purpose,” the woman screeched.
23198	“What do you want?” Arya squirmed in her grasp.
23199	Amabel had been half-crazed since they’d cut Harra’s head off.
23200	“See there?” Amabel pointed across the yard at Pia.
23201	“When this northman falls you’ll be where she is.
23202	”Let me go.
23203	” She tried to wrench free, but Amabel only tightened her fingers.
23204	“He will fall too.
23205	Harrenhal pulls them all down in the end.
23206	Lord Tywin’s won now, he’ll be marching back with all his power, and then it will be his turn to punish the disloyal.
23207	And don’t think he won’t know what you did!” The old woman laughed.
23208	“I may have a turn at you myself.
23209	Harra had an old broom, I’ll save it for you.
23210	The handle’s cracked and splintery—” Arya swung the bucket.
23211	The weight of the water made it turn in her hands, so she didn’t smash Amabel’s head in as she wanted, but the woman let go of her anyway when the water came out and drenched her.
23212	“Don’t ever touch me,” Arya shouted, “or I’ll kill you.
23213	You get away.
23214	” Sopping, Goodwife Amabel jabbed a thin finger at the flayed man on the front of Arya’s tunic.
23215	“You think you’re safe with that little bloody man on your teat, but you’re not! The Lannisters are coming! See what happens when they get here.
23216	” Three-quarters of the water had splashed out on the ground, so Arya had to return to the well.
23217	If I told Lord Bolton what she said, her head would be up next to Harra’s before it got dark, she thought as she drew up the bucket again.
23218	She wouldn’t, though.
23219	Once, when there had been only half as many heads, Gendry had caught Arya looking at them.
23220	“Admiring your work?” he asked.
23221	He was angry because he’d liked Lucan, she knew, but it still wasn’t fair.
23222	“It’s Steelshanks Walton’s work,” she said defensively.
23223	“And the Mummers, and Lord Bolton.
23224	”And who gave us all to them? You and your weasel soup.
23225	” Arya punched his arm.
23226	“It was just hot broth.
23227	You hated Ser Amory too.
23228	”I hate this lot worse.
23229	Ser Amory was fighting for his lord, but the Mummers are sellswords and turncloaks.
23230	Half of them can’t even speak the Common Tongue.
23231	Septon Utt likes little boys, Qyburn does black magic, and your friend Biter eats people.
23232	” The worst thing was, she couldn’t even say he was wrong.
23233	The Brave Companions did most of the foraging for Harrenhal, and Roose Bolton had given them the task of rooting out Lannisters.
23234	Vargo Hoat had divided them into four bands, to visit as many villages as possible.
23235	He led the largest group himself, and gave the others to his most trusted captains.
23236	She had heard Rorge laughing over Lord Vargo’s way of finding traitors.
23237	All he did was return to places he had visited before under Lord Tywin’s banner and seize those who had helped him.
23238	Many had been bought with Lannister silver, so the Mummers often returned with bags of coin as well as baskets of heads.
23239	“A riddle!” Shagwell would shout gleefully.
23240	“If Lord Bolton’s goat eats the men who fed Lord Lannister’s goat, how many goats are there?”One,” Arya said when he asked her.
23241	“Now there’s a weasel clever as a goat!” the fool tittered.
23242	470 Rorge and Biter were as bad as the others.
23243	Whenever Lord Bolton took a meal with the garrison, Arya would see them there among the rest.
23244	Biter gave off a stench like bad cheese, so the Brave Companions made him sit down near the foot of the table where he could grunt and hiss to himself and tear his meat apart with fingers and teeth.
23245	He would sniff at Arya when she passed, but it was Rorge who scared her most.
23246	He sat up near Faithful Ursywck, but she could feel his eyes crawling over her as she went about her duties.
23247	Sometimes she wished she had gone off across the narrow sea with Jaqen H’ghar.
23248	She still had the stupid coin he’d given her, a piece of iron no larger than a penny and rusted along the rim.
23249	One side had writing on it, queer words she could not read.
23250	The other showed a man’s head, but so worn that all his features had rubbed off.
23251	He said it was of great value, but that was probably a lie too, like his name and even his face.
23252	That made her so angry that she threw the coin away, but after an hour she got to feeling bad and went and found it again, even though it wasn’t worth anything.
23253	She was thinking about the coin as she crossed the Flowstone Yard, struggling with the weight of the water in her pail.
23254	“Nan,” a voice called out.
23255	“Put down that pail and come help me.
23256	” Elmar Frey was no older than she was, and short for his age besides.
23257	He had been rolling a barrel of sand across the uneven stone, and was red-faced from exertion.
23258	Arya went to help him.
23259	Together they pushed the barrel all the way to the wall and back again, then stood it upright.
23260	She could hear the sand shifting around inside as Elmar pried open the lid and pulled out a chain-mail hauberk.
23261	“Do you think it’s clean enough?” As Roose Bolton’s squire, it was his task to keep his mail shiny-bright.
23262	“You need to shake out the sand.
23263	There’s still spots of rust.
23264	See?” She pointed.
23265	“You’d best do it again.
23266	”You do it.
23267	” Elmar could be friendly when he needed help, but afterward he would always remember that he was a squire and she was only a serving girl.
23268	He liked to boast how he was the son of the Lord of the Crossing, not a nephew or a bastard or a grandson but a trueborn son, and on account of that he was going to marry a princess.
23269	Arya didn’t care about his precious princess, and didn’t like him giving her commands.
23270	“I have to bring m’lord water for his basin.
23271	He’s in his bedchamber being leeched.
23272	Not the regular black leeches but the big pale ones.
23273	” Elmar’s eyes got as big as boiled eggs.
23274	Leeches terrified him, especially the big pale ones that looked like jelly until they filled up with blood.
23275	“I forgot, you’re too skinny to push such a heavy barrel.
23276	”I forgot, you’re stupid.
23277	” Arya picked up the pail.
23278	“Maybe you should get leeched too.
23279	There’s leeches in the Neck as big as pigs.
23280	” She left him there with his barrel.
23281	The lord’s bedchamber was crowded when she entered.
23282	Qyburn was in attendance, and dour Walton in his mail shirt and greaves, plus a dozen Freys, all brothers, half-brothers, and cousins.
23283	Roose Bolton lay abed, naked.
23284	Leeches clung to the inside of his arms and legs and dotted his pallid chest, long translucent things that turned a glistening pink as they fed.
23285	Bolton paid them no more mind than he did Arya.
23286	“We must not allow Lord Tywin to trap us here at Harrenhal,” Ser Aenys Frey was saying as Arya filled the washbasin.
23287	A grey stooped giant of a man with watery red eyes and huge gnarled hands, Ser Aenys had brought fifteen hundred Frey swords south to Harrenhal, yet it often seemed as if he were helpless to command even his own brothers.
23288	“The castle is so large it requires an army to hold it, and once surrounded we cannot feed an army.
23289	Nor can we 471 hope to lay in sufficient supplies.
23290	The country is ash, the villages given over to wolves, the harvest burnt or stolen.
23291	Autumn is on us, yet there is no food in store and none being planted.
23292	We live on forage, and if the Lannisters deny that to us, we will be down to rats and shoe leather in a moon’s turn.
23293	”I do not mean to be besieged here.
23294	” Roose Bolton’s voice was so soft that men had to strain to hear it, so his chambers were always strangely hushed.
23295	“What, then?” demanded Ser Jared Frey, who was lean, balding, and pockmarked.
23296	“Is Edmure Tully so drunk on his victory that he thinks to give Lord Tywin battle in the open field?” If he does he’ll beat them, Arya thought.
23297	He’ll beat them as he did on the Red Fork, you’ll see.
23298	Unnoticed, she went to stand by Qyburn.
23299	“Lord Tywin is many leagues from here,” Bolton said calmly.
23300	“He has many matters yet to settle at King’s Landing.
23301	He will not march on Harrenhal for some time.
23302	” Ser Aenys shook his head stubbornly.
23303	“You do not know the Lannisters as we do, my lord.
23304	King Stannis thought that Lord Tywin was a thousand leagues away as well, and it undid him.
23305	” The pale man in the bed smiled faintly as the leeches nursed of his blood.
23306	“I am not a man to be undone, ser.
23307	”Even if Riverrun marshals all its strength and the Young Wolf wins back from the west, how can we hope to match the numbers Lord Tywin can send against us? When he comes, he will come with far more power than he commanded on the Green Fork.
23308	Highgarden has joined itself to Joffrey’s cause, I remind you!”I had not forgotten.
23309	”I have been Lord Tywin’s captive once,” said Ser Hosteen, a husky man with a square face who was said to be the strongest of the Freys.
23310	“I have no wish to enjoy Lannister hospitality again.
23311	” Ser Harys Haigh, who was a Frey on his mother’s side, nodded vigorously.
23312	“If Lord Tywin could defeat a seasoned man like Stannis Baratheon, what chance will our boy king have against him?” He looked round to his brothers and cousins for support, and several of them muttered agreement.
23313	“Someone must have the courage to say it,” Ser Hosteen said.
23314	“The war is lost.
23315	King Robb must be made to see that.
23316	” Roose Bolton studied him with pale eyes.
23317	“His Grace has defeated the Lannisters every time he has faced them in battle.
23318	”He has lost the north,” insisted Hosteen Frey.
23319	“He has lost Winterfell! His brothers are dead.
23320	” For a moment Arya forgot to breathe.
23321	Dead? Bran and Rickon, dead? What does he mean? What does he mean about Winterfell, Joffrey could never take Winterfell, never, Robb would never let him.
23322	Then she remembered that Robb was not at Winterfell.
23323	He was away in the west, and Bran was crippled, and Rickon only four.
23324	It took all her strength to remain still and silent, the way Syrio Forel had taught her, to stand there like a stick of furniture.
23325	She felt tears gathering in her eyes, and willed them away.
23326	It’s not true, it can’t be true, it’s just some Lannister lie.
23327	“Had Stannis won, all might have been different,” Ronel Rivers said wistfully.
23328	He was one of Lord Walder’s bastards.
23329	472 “Stannis lost,” Ser Hosteen said bluntly.
23330	“Wishing it were otherwise will not make it so.
23331	King Robb must make his peace with the Lannisters.
23332	He must put off his crown and bend the knee, little as he may like it.
23333	”And who will tell him so?” Roose Bolton smiled.
23334	“It is a fine thing to have so many valiant brothers in such troubled times.
23335	I shall think on all you’ve said.
23336	” His smile was dismissal.
23337	The Freys made their courtesies and shuffled out, leaving only Qyburn, Steelshanks Walton, and Arya.
23338	Lord Bolton beckoned her closer.
23339	“I am bled sufficiently.
23340	Nan, you may remove the leeches.
23341	”At once, my lord.
23342	” It was best never to make Roose Bolton ask twice.
23343	Arya wanted to ask him what Ser Hosteen had meant about Winterfell, but she dared not.
23344	I’ll ask Elmar, she thought.
23345	Elmar will tell me.
23346	The leeches wriggled slowly between her fingers as she plucked them carefully from the lord’s body, their pale bodies moist to the touch and distended with blood.
23347	They’re only leeches, she reminded herself.
23348	If I closed my hand, they’d squish between my fingers.
23349	“There is a letter from your lady wife.
23350	” Qyburn pulled a roll of parchment from his sleeve.
23351	Though he wore maester’s robes, there was no chain about his neck:: it was whispered that he had lost it for dabbling in necromancy.
23352	“You may read it,” Bolton said.
23353	The Lady Walda wrote from the Twins almost every day, but all the letters were the same.
23354	“I pray for you morn, noon, and night, my sweet lord,” she wrote, “and count the days until you share my bed again.
23355	Return to me soon, and I will give you many trueborn sons to take the place of your dear Domeric and rule the Dreadfort after you.
23356	” Arya pictured a plump pink baby in a cradle, covered with plump pink leeches.
23357	She brought Lord Bolton a damp washcloth to wipe down his soft hairless body.
23358	“I will send a letter of my own,” he told the onetime maester.
23359	“To the Lady Walda?”To Ser Helman Tallhart.
23360	” A rider from Ser Helman had come two days past.
23361	Tallhart men had taken the castle of the Darrys, accepting the surrender of its Lannister garrison after a brief siege.
23362	“Tell him to put the captives to the sword and the castle to the torch, by command of the king.
23363	Then he is to join forces with Robett Glover and strike east toward Duskendale.
23364	Those are rich lands, and hardly touched by the fighting.
23365	It is time they had a taste.
23366	Glover has lost a castle, and Tallhart a son.
23367	Let them take their vengeance on Duskendale.
23368	”I shall prepare the message for your seal, my lord.
23369	” Arya was glad to hear that the castle of the Darrys would be burned.
23370	That was where they’d brought her when she’d been caught after her fight with Joffrey, and where the queen had made her father kill Sansa’s wolf.
23371	It deserves to burn.
23372	She wished that Robett Glover and Ser Helman Tallhart would come back to Harrenhal, though:: they had marched too quickly, before she’d been able to decide whether to trust them with her secret.
23373	“I will hunt today,” Roose Bolton announced as Qyburn helped him into a quilted jerkin.
23374	“Is it safe, my lord?” Qyburn asked.
23375	“Only three days past, Septon Utt’s men were attacked by wolves.
23376	They came right into his camp, not five yards from the fire, and killed two horses.
23377	”It is wolves I mean to hunt.
23378	I can scarcely sleep at night for the howling.
23379	” Bolton buckled on his belt, adjusting the hang of sword and dagger.
23380	“It’s said that direwolves once roamed the north in great packs of a hundred or more, and feared neither man nor mammoth, 473 but that was long ago and in another land.
23381	It is queer to see the common wolves of the south so bold.
23382	”Terrible times breed terrible things, my lord.
23383	” Bolton showed his teeth in something that might have been a smile.
23384	“Are these times so terrible, Maester?”Summer is gone and there are four kings in the realm.
23385	”One king may be terrible, but four?” He shrugged.
23386	“Nan, my fur cloak.
23387	” She brought it to him.
23388	“My chambers will be clean and orderly upon my return,” he told her as she fastened it.
23389	“And tend to Lady Walda’s letter.
23390	”As you say, my lord.
23391	” The lord and maester swept from the room, giving her not so much as a backward glance.
23392	When they were gone, Arya took the letter and carried it to the hearth, stirring the logs with a poker to wake the flames anew.
23393	She watched the parchment twist, blacken, and flare up.
23394	If the Lannisters hurt Bran and Rickon, Robb will kill them every one.
23395	He’ll never bend the knee, never, never, never.
23396	He’s not afraid of any of them.
23397	Curls of ash floated up the chimney.
23398	Arya squatted beside the fire, watching them rise through a veil of hot tears.
23399	If Winterfell is truly gone, is this my home now? Am I still Arya, or only Nan the serving girl, for forever and forever and forever? She spent the next few hours tending to the lord’s chambers.
23400	She swept out the old rushes and scattered fresh sweet-smelling ones, laid a fresh fire in the hearth, changed the linens and fluffed the featherbed, emptied the chamber pots down the privy shaft and scrubbed them out, carried an armload of soiled clothing to the washerwomen, and brought up a bowl of crisp autumn pears from the kitchen.
23401	When she was done with the bedchamber, she went down half a flight of stairs to do the same in the great solar, a spare drafty room as large as the halls of many a smaller castle.
23402	The candles were down to stubs, so Arya changed them out.
23403	Under the windows was a huge oaken table where the lord wrote his letters.
23404	She stacked the books, changed the candles, put the quills and inks and sealing wax in order.
23405	A large ragged sheepskin was tossed across the papers.
23406	Arya had started to roll it up when the colors caught her eye: the blue of lakes and rivers, the red dots where castles and cities could be found, the green of woods.
23407	She spread it out instead.
23408	THE LANDS OF THE TRIDENT, said the ornate script beneath the map.
23409	The drawing showed everything from the Neck to the Blackwater Rush.
23410	There’s Harrenhal at the top of the big lake, she realized, but where’s Riverrun? Then she saw.
23411	It’s not so far.
23412	The afternoon was still young by the time she was done, so Arya took herself off to the godswood.
23413	Her duties were lighter as Lord Bolton’s cupbearer than they had been under Weese or even Pinkeye, though they required dressing like a page and washing more than she liked.
23414	The hunt would not return for hours, so she had a little time for her needlework.
23415	She slashed at birch leaves till the splintery point of the broken broomstick was green and sticky.
23416	“Ser Gregor,” she breathed.
23417	“Dunsen, Polliver, Raff the Sweetling.
23418	” She spun and leapt and balanced on the balls of her feet, darting this way and that, knocking pinecones flying.
23419	“The Tickler,” she called out one time, “the Hound,” the next.
23420	“Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, Queen Cersei.
23421	” The bole of an oak loomed before her, and she lunged to drive her point through it, grunting “Joffrey, Joffrey, Joffrey.
23422	” Her arms and legs were dappled by sunlight and the shadows of leaves.
23423	A sheen of sweat covered her skin by the time she paused.
23424	The heel of her right foot was bloody where she’d skinned it, so she stood one-legged before the heart tree and raised her sword in salute.
23425	“Valar morghulis,” she told the old gods of the north.
23426	She liked how the words sounded when she said them.
23427	474 As Arya crossed the yard to the bathhouse, she spied a raven circling down toward the rookery, and wondered where it had come from and what message it carried.
23428	Might be it’s from Robb, come to say it wasn’t true about Bran and Rickon.
23429	She chewed on her lip, hoping.
23430	If I had wings I could fly back to Winterfell and see for myself.
23431	And if it was true, I’d just fly away, fly up past the moon and the shining stars, and see all the things in Old Nan’s stories, dragons and sea monsters and the Titan of Braavos, and maybe I wouldn’t ever fly back unless I wanted to.
23432	The hunting party returned near evenfall with nine dead wolves.
23433	Seven were adults, big grey-brown beasts, savage and powerful, their mouths drawn back over long yellow teeth by their dying snarls.
23434	But the other two had only been pups.
23435	Lord Bolton gave orders for the skins to be sewn into a blanket for his bed.
23436	“Cubs still have that soft fur, my lord,” one of his men pointed out.
23437	“Make you a nice warm pair of gloves.
23438	” Bolton glanced up at the banners waving above the gatehouse towers.
23439	“As the Starks are wont to remind us, winter is coming.
23440	Have it done.
23441	” When he saw Arya looking on, he said, “Nan, I’ll want a flagon of hot spice wine, I took a chill in the woods.
23442	See that it doesn’t get cold.
23443	I’m of a mind to sup alone.
23444	Barley bread, butter, and boar.
23445	”At once, my lord.
23446	” That was always the best thing to say.
23447	Hot Pie was making oatcakes when she entered the kitchen.
23448	Three other cooks were boning fish, while a spit boy turned a boar over the flames.
23449	“My lord wants his supper, and hot spice wine to wash it down,” Arya announced, “and he doesn’t want it cold.
23450	” One of the cooks washed his hands, took out a kettle, and filled it with a heavy, sweet red.
23451	Hot Pie was told to crumble in the spices as the wine heated.
23452	Arya went to help.
23453	“I can do it,” he said sullenly.
23454	“I don’t need you to show me how to spice wine.
23455	” He hates me too, or else he’s scared of me.
23456	She backed away, more sad than angry.
23457	When the food was ready, the cooks covered it with a silver cover and wrapped the flagon in a thick towel to keep it warm.
23458	Dusk was settling outside.
23459	On the walls the crows muttered round the heads like courtiers round a king.
23460	One of the guards held the door to Kingspyre.
23461	“Hope that’s not weasel soup,” he jested.
23462	Roose Bolton was seated by the hearth reading from a thick leather-bound book when she entered.
23463	“Light some candles,” he commanded her as he turned a page.
23464	“It grows gloomy in here.
23465	” She placed the food at his elbow and did as he bid her, filling the room with flickering light and the scent of cloves.
23466	Bolton turned a few more pages with his finger, then closed the book and placed it carefully in the fire.
23467	He watched the flames consume it, pale eyes shining with reflected light.
23468	The old dry leather went up with a whoosh, and the yellow pages stirred as they burned, as if some ghost were reading them.
23469	“I will have no further need of you tonight,” he said, never looking at her.
23470	She should have gone, silent as a mouse, but something had hold of her.
23471	“My lord,” she asked, “will you take me with you when you leave Harrenhal?” He turned to stare at her, and from the look in his eyes it was as if his supper had just spoken to him.
23472	“Did I give you leave to question me, Nan?”No, my lord.
23473	” She lowered her eyes.
23474	“You should not have spoken, then.
23475	Should you?”No.
23476	My lord.
23477	” For a moment he looked amused.
23478	“I will answer you, just this once.
23479	I mean to give Harrenhal to Lord Vargo when I return to the north.
23480	You will remain here, with him.
23481	” 475 “But I don’t—” she started.
23482	He cut her off.
23483	“I am not in the habit of being questioned by servants, Nan.
23484	Must I have your tongue out?” He would do it as easily as another man might cuff a dog, she knew.
23485	“No, my lord.
23486	”Then I’ll hear no more from you?”No, my lord.
23487	”Go, then.
23488	I shall forget this insolence.
23489	” Arya went, but not to her bed.
23490	When she stepped out into the darkness of the yard, the guard on the door nodded at her and said, “Storm coming.
23491	Smell the air?” The wind was gusting, flames swirling off the torches mounted atop the walls beside the rows of heads.
23492	On her way to the godswood, she passed the Wailing Tower where once she had lived in fear of Weese.
23493	The Freys had taken it for their own since Harrenhal’s fall.
23494	She could hear angry voices coming from a window, many men talking and arguing all at once.
23495	Elmar was sitting on the steps outside, alone.
23496	“What’s wrong?” Arya asked him when she saw the tears shining on his cheeks.
23497	“My princess,” he sobbed.
23498	“We’ve been dishonored, Aenys says.
23499	There was a bird from the Twins.
23500	My lord father says I’ll need to marry someone else, or be a septon.
23501	” A stupid princess, she thought, that’s nothing to cry over.
23502	“My brothers might be dead,” she confided.
23503	Elmar gave her a scornful look.
23504	“No one cares about a serving girl’s brothers.
23505	” It was hard not to hit him when he said that.
23506	“I hope your princess dies,” she said, and ran off before he could grab her.
23507	In the godswood she found her broomstick sword where she had left it, and carried it to the heart tree.
23508	There she knelt.
23509	Red leaves rustled.
23510	Red eyes peered inside her.
23511	The eyes of the gods.
23512	“Tell me what to do, you gods,” she prayed.
23513	For a long moment there was no sound but the wind and the water and the creak of leaf and limb.
23514	And then, far far off, beyond the godswood and the haunted towers and the immense stone walls of Harrenhal, from somewhere out in the world, came the long lonely howl of a wolf.
23515	Gooseprickles rose on Arya’s skin, and for an instant she felt dizzy.
23516	Then, so faintly, it seemed as if she heard her father’s voice.
23517	“When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives,” he said.
23518	“But there is no pack,” she whispered to the weirwood.
23519	Bran and Rickon were dead, the Lannisters had Sansa, Jon had gone to the Wall.
23520	“I’m not even me now, I’m Nan.
23521	”You are Arya of Winterfell, daughter of the north.
23522	You told me you could be strong.
23523	You have the wolf blood in you.
23524	”The wolf blood.
23525	” Arya remembered now.
23526	“I’ll be as strong as Robb.
23527	I said I would.
23528	” She took a deep breath, then lifted the broomstick in both hands and brought it down across her knee.
23529	It broke with a loud crack, and she threw the pieces aside.
23530	I am a direwolf, and done with wooden teeth.
23531	That night she lay in her narrow bed upon the scratchy straw, listening to the voices of the living and the dead whisper and argue as she waited for the moon to rise.
23532	They were the only voices she trusted anymore.
23533	She could hear the sound of her own breath, and the wolves as well, a great pack of them now.
23534	They are closer than the one I heard in the godswood, she thought.
23535	They are calling to me.
23536	Finally she slipped from under the blanket, wriggled into a tunic, and padded barefoot down the stairs.
23537	Roose Bolton was a cautious man, and the entrance to Kingspyre was 476 guarded day and night, so she had to slip out of a narrow cellar window.
23538	The yard was still, the great castle lost in haunted dreams.
23539	Above, the wind keened through the Wailing Tower.
23540	At the forge she found the fires extinguished and the doors closed and barred.
23541	She crept in a window, as she had once before.
23542	Gendry shared a mattress with two other apprentice smiths.
23543	She crouched in the loft for a long time before her eyes adjusted enough for her to be sure that he was the one on the end.
23544	Then she put a hand over his mouth and pinched him.
23545	His eyes opened.
23546	He could not have been very deeply asleep.
23547	“Please,” she whispered.
23548	She took her hand off his mouth and pointed.
23549	For a moment she did not think he understood, but then he slid out from under the blankets.
23550	Naked, he padded across the room, shrugged into a loose rough-spun tunic, and climbed down from the loft after her.
23551	The other sleepers did not stir.
23552	“What do you want now?” Gendry said in a low angry voice.
23553	“A sword.
23554	”Blackthumb keeps all the blades locked up, I told you that a hundred times.
23555	Is this for Lord Leech?”For me.
23556	Break the lock with your hammer.
23557	”They’ll break my hand,” he grumbled.
23558	“Or worse.
23559	”Not if you run off with me.
23560	”Run, and they’ll catch you and kill you.
23561	”They’ll do you worse.
23562	Lord Bolton is giving Harrenhal to the Bloody Mummers, he told me so.
23563	” Gendry pushed black hair out of his eyes.
23564	“So?” She looked right at him, fearless.
23565	“So when Vargo Hoat’s the lord, he’s going to cut off the feet of all the servants to keep them from running away.
23566	The smiths too.
23567	”That’s only a story,” he said scornfully.
23568	“No, it’s true, I heard Lord Vargo say so,” she lied.
23569	“He’s going to cut one foot off everyone.
23570	The left one.
23571	Go to the kitchens and wake Hot Pie, he’ll do what you say.
23572	We’ll need bread or oatcakes or something.
23573	You get the swords and I’ll do the horses.
23574	We’ll meet near the postern in the east wall, behind the Tower of Ghosts.
23575	No one ever comes there.
23576	”I know that gate.
23577	It’s guarded, same as the rest.
23578	”So? You won’t forget the swords?”I never said I’d come.
23579	”No.
23580	But if you do, you won’t forget the swords?” He frowned.
23581	“No,” he said at last.
23582	“I guess I won’t.
23583	” Arya reentered Kingspyre the same way she had left it, and stole up the winding steps listening for footfalls.
23584	In her cell, she stripped to the skin and dressed herself carefully, in two layers of smallclothes, warm stockings, and her cleanest tunic.
23585	It was Lord Bolton’s livery.
23586	On the breast was sewn his sigil, the flayed man of the Dreadfort.
23587	She tied her shoes, threw a wool cloak over her skinny shoulders, and knotted it under her throat.
23588	Quiet as a shadow, she moved back down the stairs.
23589	Outside the lord’s solar she paused to listen at the door, easing it open slowly when she heard only silence.
23590	The sheepskin map was on the table, beside the remains of Lord Bolton’s supper.
23591	She rolled it up tight and thrust it through her belt.
23592	He’d left his dagger on the table as well, so she took that too, just in case Gendry lost his courage.
23593	477 A horse neighed softly as she slipped into the darkened stables.
23594	The grooms were all asleep.
23595	She prodded one with her toe until he sat up groggily and said, “Eh? Whas?”Lord Bolton requires three horses saddled and bridled.
23596	” The boy got to his feet, pushing straw from his hair.
23597	“Wha, at this hour? Horses, you say?” He blinked at the sigil on her tunic.
23598	“Whas he want horses for, in the dark?”Lord Bolton is not in the habit of being questioned by servants.
23599	” She crossed her arms.
23600	The stableboy was still looking at the flayed man.
23601	He knew what it meant.
23602	“Three, you say?”One two three.
23603	Hunting horses.
23604	Fast and surefoot.
23605	” Arya helped him with the bridles and saddles, so he would not need to wake any of the others.
23606	She hoped they would not hurt him afterward, but she knew they probably would.
23607	Leading the horses across the castle was the worst part.
23608	She stayed in the shadow of the curtain wall whenever she could, so the sentries walking their rounds on the ramparts above would have needed to look almost straight down to see her.
23609	And if they do, what of it? I’m my lord’s own cupbearer.
23610	It was a chill dank autumn night.
23611	Clouds were blowing in from the west, hiding the stars, and the Wailing Tower screamed mournfully at every gust of wind.
23612	It smells like rain.
23613	Arya did not know whether that would be good or bad for their escape.
23614	No one saw her, and she saw no one, only a grey-and-white cat creeping along atop the godswood wall.
23615	It stopped and spit at her, waking memories of the Red Keep and her father and Syrio Forel.
23616	“I could catch you if I wanted,” she called to it softly, “but I have to go, cat.
23617	” The cat hissed again and ran off.
23618	The Tower of Ghosts was the most ruinous of Harrenhal’s five immense towers.
23619	It stood dark and desolate behind the remains of a collapsed sept where only rats had come to pray for near three hundred years.
23620	It was there she waited to see if Gendry and Hot Pie would come.
23621	It seemed as though she waited a long time.
23622	The horses nibbled at the weeds that grew up between the broken stones while the clouds swallowed the last of the stars.
23623	Arya took out the dagger and sharpened it to keep her hands busy.
23624	Long smooth strokes, the way Syrio had taught her.
23625	The sound calmed her.
23626	She heard them coming long before she saw them.
23627	Hot Pie was breathing heavily, and once he stumbled in the dark, barked his shin, and cursed loud enough to wake half of Harrenhal.
23628	Gendry was quieter, but the swords he was carrying rang together as he moved.
23629	“Here I am.
23630	” She stood.
23631	“Be quiet or they’ll hear you.
23632	” The boys picked their way toward her over tumbled stones.
23633	Gendry was wearing oiled chain-mail under his cloak, she saw, and he had his blacksmith’s hammer slung across his back.
23634	Hot Pie’s red round face peered out from under a hood.
23635	He had a sack of bread dangling from his right hand and a big wheel of cheese under his left arm.
23636	“There’s a guard on that postern,” said Gendry quietly.
23637	“I told you there would be.
23638	”You stay here with the horses,” said Arya.
23639	“I’ll get rid of him.
23640	Come quick when I call.
23641	” Gendry nodded.
23642	Hot Pie said, “Hoot like an owl when you want us to come.
23643	”I’m not an owl,” said Arya.
23644	“I’m a wolf.
23645	I’ll howl.
23646	” Alone, she slid through the shadow of the Tower of Ghosts.
23647	She walked fast, to keep ahead of her fear, and it felt as though Syrio Forel walked beside her, and Yoren, and Jaqen H’ghar, and Jon Snow.
23648	She had not taken the sword Gendry had brought her, not yet.
23649	For this the dagger would be better.
23650	It was good and sharp.
23651	This postern was the least of Harrenhal’s gates, a narrow door of stout oak studded with iron nails, set in an angle of the wall beneath a defensive tower.
23652	Only one man was set to guard it, but she knew there would be sentries up in 478 that tower as well, and others nearby walking the walls.
23653	Whatever happened, she must be quiet as a shadow.
23654	He must not call out.
23655	A few scattered raindrops had begun to fall.
23656	She felt one land on her brow and run slowly down her nose.
23657	She made no effort to hide, but approached the guard openly, as if Lord Bolton himself had sent her.
23658	He watched her come, curious as to what might bring a page here at this black hour.
23659	When she got closer, she saw that he was a northman, very tall and thin, huddled in a ragged fur cloak.
23660	That was bad.
23661	She might have been able to trick a Frey or one of the Brave Companions, but the Dreadfort men had served Roose Bolton their whole life, and they knew him better than she did.
23662	If I tell him I am Arya Stark and command him to stand aside.
23663	No, she dare not.
23664	He was a northman, but not a Winterfell man.
23665	He belonged to Roose Bolton.
23666	When she reached him she pushed back her cloak so he would see the flayed man on her breast.
23667	“Lord Bolton sent me.
23668	”At this hour? Why for?” She could see the gleam of steel under the fur, and she did not know if she was strong enough to drive the point of the dagger through chain-mail.
23669	His throat, it must be his throat, but he’s too tall, I’ll never reach it.
23670	For a moment she did not know what to say.
23671	For a moment she was a little girl again, and scared, and the rain on her face felt like tears.
23672	“He told me to give all his guards a silver piece, for their good service.
23673	” The words seemed to come out of nowhere.
23674	“Silver, you say?” He did not believe her, but he wanted to:: silver was silver, after all.
23675	“Give it over, then.
23676	” Her fingers dug down beneath her tunic and came out clutching the coin Jaqen had given her.
23677	In the dark the iron could pass for tarnished silver.
23678	She held it out.
23679	and let it slip through her fingers.
23680	Cursing her softly, the man went to a knee to grope for the coin in the dirt and there was his neck right in front of her.
23681	Arya slid her dagger out and drew it across his throat, as smooth as summer silk.
23682	His blood covered her hands in a hot gush and he tried to shout but there was blood in his mouth as well.
23683	“Valar morghulis,” she whispered as he died.
23684	When he stopped moving, she picked up the coin.
23685	Outside the walls of Harrenhal, a wolf howled long and loud.
23686	She lifted the bar, set it aside, and pulled open the heavy oak door.
23687	By the time Hot Pie and Gendry came up with the horses, the rain was falling hard.
23688	“You killed him!” Hot Pie gasped.
23689	“What did you think I would do?” Her fingers were sticky with blood, and the smell was making her mare skittish.
23690	It’s no matter, she thought, swinging up into the saddle.
23691	The rain will wash them clean again.
23692	CHAPTER SIXTY-FIVE SANSA The throne room was a sea of jewels, furs, and bright fabrics.
23693	Lords and ladies filled the back of the hall and stood beneath the high windows, jostling like fishwives on a dock.
23694	The denizens of Joffrey’s court had striven to outdo each other today.
23695	Jalabhar Xho was all in feathers, a plumage so fantastic and extravagant that he seemed like to take flight.
23696	The High Septon’s crystal crown fired rainbows through the air every time he moved his head.
23697	At the council table, Queen Cersei shimmered in a cloth-of-gold gown slashed in burgundy velvet, while beside her Varys fussed and simpered in a lilac brocade.
23698	Moon Boy and Ser 479 Dontos wore new suits of motley, clean as a spring morning.
23699	Even Lady Tanda and her daughters looked pretty in matching gowns of turquoise silk and vair, and Lord Gyles was coughing into a square of scarlet silk trimmed with golden lace.
23700	King Joffrey sat above them all, amongst the blades and barbs of the Iron Throne.
23701	He was in crimson samite, his black mantle studded with rubies, on his head his heavy golden crown.
23702	Squirming through a press of knights, squires, and rich townfolk, Sansa reached the front of the gallery just as a blast of trumpets announced the entry of Lord Tywin Lannister.
23703	He rode his warhorse down the length of the hall and dismounted before the Iron Throne.
23704	Sansa had never seen such armor:: all burnished red steel, inlaid with golden scrollwork and ornamentation.
23705	His rondels were sunbursts, the roaring lion that crowned his helm had ruby eyes, and a lioness on each shoulder fastened a cloth-of-gold cloak so long and heavy that it draped the hindquarters of his charger.
23706	Even the horse’s armor was gilded, and his bardings were shimmering crimson silk emblazoned with the lion of Lannister.
23707	The Lord of Casterly Rock made such an impressive figure that it was a shock when his destrier dropped a load of dung right at the base of the throne.
23708	Joffrey had to step gingerly around it as he descended to embrace his grandfather and proclaim him Savior of the City.
23709	Sansa covered her mouth to hide a nervous smile.
23710	Joff made a show of asking his grandfather to assume governance of the realm, and Lord Tywin solemnly accepted the responsibility, “until Your Grace does come of age.
23711	” Then squires removed his armor and Joff fastened the Hand’s chain of office around his neck.
23712	Lord Tywin took a seat at the council table beside the queen.
23713	After the destrier was led off and his homage removed, Cersei nodded for the ceremonies to continue.
23714	A fanfare of brazen trumpets greeted each of the heroes as he stepped between the great oaken doors.
23715	Heralds cried his name and deeds for all to hear, and the noble knights and highborn ladies cheered as lustily as cutthroats at a cockfight.
23716	Pride of place was given to Mace Tyrell, the Lord of Highgarden, a once-powerful man gone to fat, yet still handsome.
23717	His sons followed him in:: Ser Loras and his older brother Ser Garlan the Gallant.
23718	The three dressed alike, in green velvet trimmed with sable.
23719	The king descended the throne once more to greet them, a great honor.
23720	He fastened about the throat of each a chain of roses wrought in soft yellow gold, from which hung a golden disc with the lion of Lannister picked out in rubies.
23721	“The roses support the lion, as the might of Highgarden supports the realm,” proclaimed Joffrey.
23722	“If there is any boon you would ask of me, ask and it shall be yours.
23723	” And now it comes, thought Sansa.
23724	“Your Grace,” said Ser Loras, “I beg the honor of serving in your Kingsguard, to defend you against your enemies.
23725	” Joffrey drew the Knight of Flowers to his feet and kissed him on his cheek.
23726	“Done, brother.
23727	” Lord Tyrell bowed his head.
23728	“There is no greater pleasure than to serve the King’s Grace.
23729	If I was deemed worthy to join your royal council, you would find none more loyal or true.
23730	” Joff put a hand on Lord Tyrell’s shoulder and kissed him when he stood.
23731	“Your wish is granted.
23732	” Ser Garlan Tyrell, five years senior to Ser Loras, was a taller bearded version of his more famous younger brother.
23733	He was thicker about the chest and broader at the shoulders, and though his face was comely enough, he lacked Ser Loras’s startling beauty.
23734	“Your Grace,” Garlan said when the king approached him, “I have a maiden sister, Margaery, the delight of our House.
23735	She was wed to Renly Baratheon, as you know, but Lord Renly went to war 480 before the marriage could be consummated, so she remains innocent.
23736	Margaery has heard tales of your wisdom, courage, and chivalry, and has come to love you from afar.
23737	I beseech you to send for her, to take her hand in marriage, and to wed your House to mine for all time.
23738	” King Joffrey made a show of looking surprised.
23739	“Ser Garlan, your sister’s beauty is famed throughout the Seven Kingdoms, but I am promised to another.
23740	A king must keep his word.
23741	” Queen Cersei got to her feet in a rustle of skirts.
23742	“Your Grace, in the judgment of your small council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne even now.
23743	Sire, your councilors beg you, for the good of your realm, set Sansa Stark aside.
23744	The Lady Margaery will make you a far more suitable queen.
23745	” Like a pack of trained dogs, the lords and ladies in the hall began to shout their pleasure.
23746	“Margaery,” they called.
23747	“Give us Margaery!” and “No traitor queens! Tyrell! Tyrell!” Joffrey raised a hand.
23748	“I would like to heed the wishes of my people, Mother, but I took a holy vow.
23749	” The High Septon stepped forward.
23750	“Your Grace, the gods hold betrothal solemn, but your father, King Robert of blessed memory, made this pact before the Starks of Winterfell had revealed their falseness.
23751	Their crimes against the realm have freed you from any promise you might have made.
23752	So far as the Faith is concerned, there is no valid marriage contract ‘twixt you and Sansa Stark.
23753	” A tumult of cheering filled the throne room, and cries of “Margaery, Margaery,” erupted all around her.
23754	Sansa leaned forward, her hands tight around the gallery’s wooden rail.
23755	She knew what came next, but she was still frightened of what Joffrey might say, afraid that he would refuse to release her even now, when his whole kingdom depended upon it.
23756	She felt as if she were back again on the marble steps outside the Great Sept of Baelor, waiting for her prince to grant her father mercy, and instead hearing him command Ilyn Payne to strike off his head.
23757	Please, she prayed fervently, make him say it, make him say it.
23758	Lord Tywin was looking at his grandson.
23759	Joff gave him a sullen glance, shifted his feet, and helped Ser Garlan Tyrell to rise.
23760	“The gods are good.
23761	I am free to heed my heart.
23762	I will wed your sweet sister, and gladly, ser.
23763	” He kissed Ser Garlan on a bearded cheek as the cheers rose all around them.
23764	Sansa felt curiously light-headed.
23765	I am free.
23766	She could feel eyes upon her.
23767	I must not smile, she reminded herself.
23768	The queen had warned her:: no matter what she felt inside, the face she showed the world must look distraught.
23769	“I will not have my son humiliated,” Cersei said.
23770	“Do you hear me?”Yes.
23771	But if I’m not to be queen, what will become of me?”That will need to be determined.
23772	For the moment, you shall remain here at court, as our ward.
23773	”I want to go home.
23774	” The queen was irritated by that.
23775	“You should have learned by now, none of us get the things we want.
23776	” I have, though, Sansa thought.
23777	I am free of Joffrey.
23778	I will not have to kiss him, nor give him my maidenhood, nor bear him children.
23779	Let Margaery Tyrell have all that, poor girl.
23780	By the time the outburst died down, the Lord of Highgarden had been seated at the council table, and his sons had joined the other knights and lordlings beneath the windows.
23781	481 Sansa tried to look forlorn and abandoned as other heroes of the Battle of the Blackwater were summoned forth to receive their rewards.
23782	Paxter Redwyne, Lord of the Arbor, marched down the length of the hall flanked by his twin sons Horror and Slobber, the former limping from a wound taken in the battle.
23783	After them followed Lord Mathis Rowan in a snowy doublet with a great tree worked upon the breast in gold thread:: Lord Randyll Tarly, lean and balding, a greatsword across his back in a jeweled scabbard:: Ser Kevan Lannister, a thickset balding man with a close-trimmed beard:: Ser Addam Marbrand, coppery hair streaming to his shoulders:: the great western lords Lydden, Crakehall, and Brax.
23784	Next came four of lesser birth who had distinguished themselves in the fighting: the oneeyed knight Ser Philip Foote, who had slain Lord Bryce Caron in single combat:: the freerider Lothor Brune, who’d cut his way through half a hundred Fossoway men-at-arms to capture Ser Jon of the green apple and kill Ser Bryan and Ser Edwyd of the red, thereby winning himself the name Lothor Apple-Eater:: Willit, a grizzled man-at-arms in the service of Ser Harys Swyft, who’d pulled his master from beneath his dying horse and defended him against a dozen attackers:: and a downy-cheeked squire named Josmyn Peckledon, who had killed two knights, wounded a third, and captured two more, though he could not have been more than fourteen.
23785	Willit was borne in on a litter, so grievous were his wounds.
23786	Ser Kevan had taken a seat beside his brother Lord Tywin.
23787	When the heralds had finished telling of each hero’s deeds, he rose.
23788	“It is His Grace’s wish that these good men be rewarded for their valor.
23789	By his decree, Ser Philip shall henceforth be Lord Philip of House Foote, and to him shall go all the lands, rights, and incomes of House Caron.
23790	Lothor Brune to be raised to the estate of knighthood, and granted land and keep in the riverlands at war’s end.
23791	To Josmyn Peckledon, a sword and suit of plate, his choice of any warhorse in the royal stables, and knighthood as soon as he shall come of age.
23792	And lastly, for Goodman Willit, a spear with a silver-banded haft, a hauberk of new-forged ringmail, and a full helm with visor.
23793	Further, the goodman’s sons shall be taken into the service of House Lannister at Casterly Rock, the elder as a squire and the younger as a page, with the chance to advance to knighthood if they serve loyally and well.
23794	To all this, the King’s Hand and the small council consent.
23795	” The captains of the king’s warships Wildwind, Prince Aemon, and River Arrow were honored next, along with some under-officers from Godsgrace, Lance, Lady of Silk, and Ramshead.
23796	As near as Sansa could tell, their chief accomplishment had been surviving the battle on the river, a feat that few enough could boast.
23797	Hallyne the Pyromancer and the masters of the Alchemists’ Guild received the king’s thanks as well, and Hallyne was raised to the style of lord, though Sansa noted that neither lands nor castle accompanied the title, which made the alchemist no more a true lord than Varys was.
23798	A more significant lordship by far was granted to Ser Lancel Lannister.
23799	Joffrey awarded him the lands, castle, and rights of House Darry, whose last child lord had perished during the fighting in the riverlands, “leaving no trueborn heirs of lawful Darry blood, but only a bastard cousin.
23800	” Ser Lancel did not appear to accept the title:: the talk was, his wound might cost him his arm or even his life.
23801	The Imp was said to be dying as well, from a terrible cut to the head.
23802	When the herald called, “Lord Petyr Baelish,” he came forth dressed all in shades of rose and plum, his cloak patterned with mockingbirds.
23803	She could see him smiling as he knelt before the Iron Throne.
23804	He looks so pleased.
23805	Sansa had not heard of Littlefinger doing anything especially heroic during the battle, but it seemed he was to be rewarded all the same.
23806	Ser Kevan got back to his feet.
23807	“It is the wish of the King’s Grace that his loyal councilor Petyr Baelish be rewarded for faithful service to crown and realm.
23808	Be it known that Lord Baelish is granted the castle of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes, there to 482 make his seat and rule henceforth as Lord Paramount of the Trident.
23809	Petyr Baelish and his sons and grandsons shall hold and enjoy these honors until the end of time, and all the lords of the Trident shall do him homage as their rightful liege.
23810	The King’s Hand and the small council consent.
23811	” On his knees, Littlefinger raised his eyes to King Joffrey.
23812	“I thank you humbly, Your Grace.
23813	I suppose this means I’ll need to see about getting some sons and grandsons.
23814	” Joffrey laughed, and the court with him.
23815	Lord Paramount of the Trident, Sansa thought, and Lord of Harrenhal as well.
23816	She did not understand why that should make him so happy:: the honors were as empty as the title granted to Hallyne the Pyromancer.
23817	Harrenhal was cursed, everyone knew that, and the Lannisters did not even hold it at present.
23818	Besides, the lords of the Trident were sworn to Riverrun and House Tully, and to the King in the North:: they would never accept Littlefinger as their liege.
23819	Unless they are made to.
23820	Unless my brother and my uncle and my grandfather are all cast down and killed.
23821	The thought made Sansa anxious, but she told herself she was being silly.
23822	Robb has beaten them every time.
23823	He’ll beat Lord Baelish too, if he must.
23824	More than six hundred new knights were made that day.
23825	They had held their vigil in the Great Sept of Baelor all through the night and crossed the city barefoot that morning to prove their humble hearts.
23826	Now they came forward dressed in shifts of undyed wool to receive their knighthoods from the Kingsguard.
23827	It took a long time, since only three of the Brothers of the White Sword were on hand to dub them.
23828	Mandon Moore had perished in the battle, the Hound had vanished, Aerys Oakheart was in Dorne with Princess Myrcella, and Jaime Lannister was Robb’s captive, so the Kingsguard had been reduced to Balon Swann, Meryn Trant, and Osmund Kettleblack.
23829	Once knighted, each man rose, buckled on his swordbelt, and stood beneath the windows.
23830	Some had bloody feet from their walk through the city, but they stood tall and proud all the same, it seemed to Sansa.
23831	By the time all the new knights had been given their sers the hall was growing restive, and none more so than Joffrey.
23832	Some of those in the gallery had begun to slip quietly away, but the notables on the floor were trapped, unable to depart without the king’s leave.
23833	Judging by the way he was fidgeting atop the Iron Throne, Joff would willingly have granted it, but the day’s work was far from done.
23834	For now the coin was turned over, and the captives were ushered in.
23835	There were great lords and noble knights in that company too: sour old Lord Celtigar, the Red Crab:: Ser Bonifer the Good:: Lord Estermont, more ancient even than Celtigar:: Lord Varner, who hobbled the length of the hall on a shattered knee, but would accept no help:: Ser Mark Mullendore, grey-faced, his left arm gone to the elbow:: fierce Red Ronnet of Griffin Roost:: Ser Dermot of the Rainwood:: Lord Willurn and his sons Josua and Elyas:: Ser Jon Fossoway:: Ser Timon the Scrapesword:: Aurane, the bastard of Driftmark:: Lord Staedmon, called Pennylover:: hundreds of others.
23836	Those who had changed their allegiance during the battle needed only to swear fealty to Joffrey, but the ones who had fought for Stannis until the bitter end were compelled to speak.
23837	Their words decided their fate.
23838	If they begged forgiveness for their treasons and promised to serve loyally henceforth, Joffrey welcomed them back into the king’s peace and restored them to all their lands and rights.
23839	A handful remained defiant, however.
23840	“Do not imagine this is done, boy,” warned one, the bastard son of some Florent or other.
23841	“The Lord of Light protects King Stannis, now and always.
23842	All your swords and all your scheming shall not save you when his hour comes.
23843	”Your hour is come right now.
23844	” Joffrey beckoned to Ser Ilyn Payne to take the man out and strike his head off.
23845	483 But no sooner had that one been dragged away than a knight of solemn mien with a fiery heart on his surcoat shouted out, “Stannis is the true king! A monster sits the Iron Throne, an abomination born of incest!”Be silent,” Ser Kevan Lannister bellowed.
23846	The knight raised his voice instead.
23847	“Joffrey is the black worm eating the heart of the realm! Darkness was his father, and death his mother! Destroy him before he corrupts you all! Destroy them all, queen whore and king worm, vile dwarf and whispering spider, the false flowers.
23848	Save yourselves!” One of the gold cloaks knocked the man off his feet, but he continued to shout.
23849	“The scouring fire will come! King Stannis will return!” Joffrey lurched to his feet.
23850	“I’m king! Kill him! Kill him now! I command it.
23851	” He chopped down with his hand, a furious, angry gesture.
23852	and screeched in pain when his arm brushed against one of the sharp metal fangs that surrounded him.
23853	The bright crimson samite of his sleeve turned a darker shade of red as his blood soaked through it.
23854	“Mother!” he wailed.
23855	With every eye on the king, somehow the man on the floor wrested a spear away from one of the gold cloaks, and used it to push himself back to his feet.
23856	“The throne denies him!” he cried.
23857	“He is no king!” Cersei was running toward the throne, but Lord Tywin remained still as stone.
23858	He had only to raise a finger, and Ser Meryn Trant moved forward with drawn sword.
23859	The end was quick and brutal.
23860	The gold cloaks seized the knight by the arms.
23861	“No king!” he cried again as Ser Meryn drove the point of his longsword through his chest.
23862	Joff fell into his mother’s arms.
23863	Three maesters came hurrying forward, to bundle him out through the king’s door.
23864	Then everyone began talking at once.
23865	When the gold cloaks dragged off the dead man, he left a trail of bright blood across the stone floor.
23866	Lord Baelish stroked his beard while Varys whispered in his ear.
23867	Will they dismiss us now? Sansa wondered.
23868	A score of captives still waited, though whether to pledge fealty or shout curses, who could say? Lord Tywin rose to his feet.
23869	“We continue,” he said in a clear strong voice that silenced the murmurs.
23870	“Those who wish to ask pardon for their treasons may do so.
23871	We will have no more follies.
23872	” He moved to the Iron Throne and there seated himself on a step, a mere three feet off the floor.
23873	The light outside the windows was fading by the time the session drew to a close.
23874	Sansa felt limp with exhaustion as she made her way down from the gallery.
23875	She wondered how badly Joffrey had cut himself.
23876	They say the Iron Throne can be perilous cruel to those who were not meant to sit it.
23877	Back in the safety of her own chambers, she hugged a pillow to her face to muffle a squeal of joy.
23878	Oh, gods be good, he did it, he put me aside in front of everyone.
23879	When a serving girl brought her supper, she almost kissed her.
23880	There was hot bread and fresh-churned butter, a thick beef soup, capon and carrots, and peaches in honey.
23881	Even the food tastes sweeter, she thought.
23882	Come dark, she slipped into a cloak and left for the godswood.
23883	Ser Osmund Kettleblack was guarding the drawbridge in his white armor.
23884	Sansa tried her best to sound miserable as she bid him a good evening.
23885	From the way he leered at her, she was not sure she had been wholly convincing.
23886	Dontos waited in the leafy moonlight.
23887	“Why so sad-faced?” Sansa asked him gaily.
23888	“You were there, you heard.
23889	Joff put me aside, he’s done with me, he’s.
23890	” He took her hand.
23891	“Oh, Jonquil, my poor Jonquil, you do not understand.
23892	Done with you? They’ve scarcely begun.
23893	” 484 Her heart sank.
23894	“What do you mean?”The queen will never let you go, never.
23895	You are too valuable a hostage.
23896	And Joffrey.
23897	sweetling, he is still king.
23898	If he wants you in his bed, he will have you, only now it will be bastards he plants in your womb instead of trueborn sons.
23899	”No,” Sansa said, shocked.
23900	“He let me go, he.
23901	” Ser Dontos planted a slobbery kiss on her ear.
23902	“Be brave.
23903	I swore to see you home, and now I can.
23904	The day has been chosen.
23905	”When?” Sansa asked.
23906	“When will we go?”The night of Joffrey’s wedding.
23907	After the feast.
23908	All the necessary arrangements have been made.
23909	The Red Keep will be full of strangers.
23910	Half the court will be drunk and the other half will be helping Joffrey bed his bride.
23911	For a little while, you will be forgotten, and the confusion will be our friend.
23912	”The wedding won’t be for a moon’s turn yet.
23913	Margaery Tyrell is at Highgarden, they’ve only now sent for her.
23914	”You’ve waited so long, be patient a while longer.
23915	Here, I have something for you.
23916	” Ser Dontos fumbled in his pouch and drew out a silvery spider-web, dangling it between his thick fingers.
23917	It was a hair net of fine-spun silver, the strands so thin and delicate the net seemed to weigh no more than a breath of air when Sansa took it in her fingers.
23918	Small gems were set wherever two strands crossed, so dark they drank the moonlight.
23919	“What stones are these?”Black amethysts from Asshai.
23920	The rarest kind, a deep true purple by daylight.
23921	”It’s very lovely,” Sansa said, thinking, It is a ship I need, not a net for my hair.
23922	“Lovelier than you know, sweet child.
23923	It’s magic, you see.
23924	It’s justice you hold.
23925	It’s vengeance for your father.
23926	” Dontos leaned close and kissed her again.
23927	“It’s home.
23928	” CHAPTER SIXTY-SIX THEON Maester Luwin came to him when the first scouts were seen outside the walls.
23929	“My lord prince,” he said, “you must yield.
23930	” Theon stared at the platter of oakcakes, honey, and blood sausage they’d brought him to break his fast.
23931	Another sleepless night had left his nerves raw, and the very sight of food sickened him.
23932	“There has been no reply from my uncle?”None,” the maester said.
23933	“Nor from your father on Pyke.
23934	”Send more birds.
23935	”It will not serve.
23936	By the time the birds reach—”Send them!” Knocking the platter of food aside with a swipe of his arm, he pushed off the blankets and rose from Ned Stark’s bed naked and angry.
23937	“Or do you want me dead? Is that it, Luwin? The truth now.
23938	” The small grey man was unafraid.
23939	“My order serves.
23940	”Yes, but whom?”The realm,” Maester Luwin said, “and Winterfell.
23941	Theon, once I taught you sums and letters, history and warcraft.
23942	And might have taught you more, had you wished to learn.
23943	I will not claim to bear you any great love, no, but I cannot hate you either.
23944	Even if I did, so long as you hold Winterfell I am bound by oath to give you counsel.
23945	So now I counsel you to yield.
23946	” 485 Theon stooped to scoop a puddled cloak off the floor, shook off the rushes, and draped it over his shoulders.
23947	A fire, I’ll have a fire, and clean garb.
23948	Where’s Wex? I’ll not go to my grave in dirty clothes.
23949	“You have no hope of holding here,” the maester went on.
23950	“If your lord father meant to send you aid, he would have done so by now.
23951	It is the Neck that concerns him.
23952	The battle for the north will be fought amidst the ruins of Moat Cailin.
23953	”That may be so,” said Theon.
23954	“And so long as I hold Winterfell, Ser Rodrik and Stark’s lords bannermen cannot march south to take my uncle in the rear.
23955	” I am not so innocent of warcraft as you think, old man.
23956	“I have food enough to stand a year’s siege, if need be.
23957	”There will be no siege.
23958	Perhaps they will spend a day or two fashioning ladders and tying grapnels to the ends of ropes.
23959	But soon enough they will come over your walls in a hundred places at once.
23960	You may be able to hold the keep for a time, but the castle will fall within the hour.
23961	You would do better to open your gates and ask for—”—mercy? I know what kind of mercy they have for me.
23962	”There is a way.
23963	”I am ironborn,” Theon reminded him.
23964	“I have my own way.
23965	What choice have they left me? No, don’t answer, I’ve heard enough of your counsel.
23966	Go and send those birds as I commanded, and tell Lorren I want to see him.
23967	And Wex as well.
23968	I’ll have my mail scoured clean, and my garrison assembled in the yard.
23969	” For a moment he thought the maester was going to defy him.
23970	But finally Luwin bowed stiffly.
23971	“As you command.
23972	” They made a pitifully small assembly:: the ironmen were few, the yard large.
23973	“The northmen will be on us before nightfall,” he told them.
23974	“Ser Rodrik Cassel and all the lords who have come to his call.
23975	I will not run from them.
23976	I took this castle and I mean to hold it, to live or die as Prince of Winterfell.
23977	But I will not command any man to die with me.
23978	If you leave now, before Ser Rodrik’s main force is upon us, there’s still a chance you may win free.
23979	” He unsheathed his longsword and drew a line in the dirt.
23980	“Those who would stay and fight, step forward.
23981	” No one spoke.
23982	The men stood in their mail and fur and boiled leather, as still as if they were made of stone.
23983	A few exchanged looks.
23984	Urzen shuffled his feet.
23985	Dykk Harlaw hawked and spat.
23986	A finger of wind ruffled Endehar’s long fair hair.
23987	Theon felt as though he were drowning.
23988	Why am I surprised? he thought bleakly.
23989	His father had forsaken him, his uncles, his sister, even that wretched creature Reek.
23990	Why should his men prove any more loyal? There was nothing to say, nothing to do.
23991	He could only stand there beneath the great grey walls and the hard white sky, sword in hand, waiting, waiting.
23992	Wex was the first to cross the line.
23993	Three quick steps and he stood at Theon’s side, slouching.
23994	Shamed by the boy, Black Lorren followed, all scowls.
23995	“Who else?” he demanded.
23996	Red Rolfe came forward.
23997	Kromm.
23998	Werlag.
23999	Tymor and his brothers.
24000	Ulf the Ill.
24001	Harrag Sheepstealer.
24002	Four Harlaws and two Botleys.
24003	Kenned the Whale was the last.
24004	Seventeen in all.
24005	Urzen was among those who did not move, and Stygg, and every man of the ten that Asha had brought from Deepwood Motte.
24006	“Go, then,” Theon told them.
24007	“Run to my sister.
24008	She’ll give you all a warm welcome, I have no doubt.
24009	” Stygg had the grace at least to look ashamed.
24010	The rest moved off without a word.
24011	Theon turned to the seventeen who remained.
24012	“Back to the walls.
24013	If the gods should spare us, I shall remember every man of you.
24014	” 486 Black Lorren stayed when the others had gone.
24015	“The castle folk will turn on us soon as the fight begins.
24016	”I know that.
24017	What would you have me do?”Put them out,” said Lorren.
24018	“Every one.
24019	” Theon shook his head.
24020	“Is the noose ready?”It is.
24021	You mean to use it?”Do you know a better way?”Aye.
24022	I’ll take my axe and stand on that drawbridge, and let them come try me.
24023	One at a time, two, three, it makes no matter.
24024	None will pass the moat while I still draw breath.
24025	” He means to die, thought Theon.
24026	It’s not victory he wants, it’s an end worthy of a song.
24027	“We’ll use the noose.
24028	”As you say,” Lorren replied, contempt in his eyes.
24029	Wex helped garb him for battle.
24030	Beneath his black surcoat and golden mantle was a shirt of well-oiled ringmail, and under that a layer of stiff boiled leather.
24031	Once armed and armored, Theon climbed the watchtower at the angle where the eastern and southern walls came together to have a look at his doom.
24032	The northmen were spreading out to encircle the castle.
24033	It was hard to judge their numbers.
24034	A thousand at least:: perhaps twice that many.
24035	Against seventeen.
24036	They’d brought catapults and scorpions.
24037	He saw no siege towers rumbling up the kingsroad, but there was timber enough in the wolfswood to build as many as were required.
24038	Theon studied their banners through Maester Luwin’s Myrish lens tube.
24039	The Cerwyn battle-axe flapped bravely wherever he looked, and there were Tallhart trees as well, and mermen from White Harbor.
24040	Less common were the sigils of Flint and Karstark.
24041	Here and there he even saw the bull moose of the Hornwoods.
24042	But no Glovers, Asha saw to them, no Boltons from the Dreadfort, no Umbers come down from the shadow of the Wall.
24043	Not that they were needed.
24044	Soon enough the boy Cley Cerwyn appeared before the gates carrying a peace banner on a tall staff, to announce that Ser Rodrik Cassel wished to parley with Theon Turncloak.
24045	Turncloak.
24046	The name was bitter as bile.
24047	He had gone to Pyke to lead his father’s longships against Lannisport, he remembered.
24048	“I shall be out shortly,” he shouted down.
24049	“Alone.
24050	” Black Lorren disapproved.
24051	“Only blood can wash out blood,” he declared.
24052	“Knights may keep their truces with other knights, but they are not so careful of their honor when dealing with those they deem outlaw.
24053	” Theon bristled.
24054	“I am the Prince of Winterfell and heir to the Iron Islands.
24055	Now go find the girl and do as I told you.
24056	” Black Lorren gave him a murderous look.
24057	“Aye, Prince.
24058	” He’s turned against me too, Theon realized.
24059	Of late it seemed to him as if the very stones of Winterfell had turned against him.
24060	If I die, I die friendless and abandoned.
24061	What choice did that leave him, but to live? He rode to the gatehouse with his crown on his head.
24062	A woman was drawing water from the well, and Gage the cook stood in the door of the kitchens.
24063	They hid their hatred behind sullen looks and faces blank as slate, yet he could feel it all the same.
24064	When the drawbridge was lowered, a chill wind sighed across the moat.
24065	The touch of it made him shiver.
24066	It is the cold, nothing more, Theon told himself, a shiver, not a tremble.
24067	Even brave men shiver.
24068	Into the teeth of that wind he rode, under the portcullis, over the 487 drawbridge.
24069	The outer gates swung open to let him pass.
24070	As he emerged beneath the walls, he could sense the boys watching from the empty sockets where their eyes had been.
24071	Ser Rodrik waited in the market astride his dappled gelding.
24072	Beside him, the direwolf of Stark flapped from a staff borne by young Cley Cerwyn.
24073	They were alone in the square, though Theon could see archers on the roofs of surrounding houses, spearmen to his right, and to his left a line of mounted knights beneath the merman-and-trident of House Manderly.
24074	Every one of them wants me dead.
24075	Some were boys he’d drunk with, diced with, even wenched with, but that would not save him if he fell into their hands.
24076	“Ser Rodrik.
24077	” Theon reined to a halt.
24078	“It grieves me that we must meet as foes.
24079	”My own grief is that I must wait a while to hang you.
24080	” The old knight spat onto the muddy ground.
24081	“Theon Turncloak.
24082	”I am a Greyjoy of Pyke,” Theon reminded him.
24083	“The cloak my father swaddled me in bore a kraken, not a direwolf.
24084	”For ten years you have been a ward of Stark.
24085	”Hostage and prisoner, I call it.
24086	”Then perhaps Lord Eddard should have kept you chained to a dungeon wall.
24087	Instead he raised you among his own sons, the sweet boys you have butchered, and to my undying shame I trained you in the arts of war.
24088	Would that I had thrust a sword through your belly instead of placing one in your hand.
24089	”I came out to parley, not to suffer your insults.
24090	Say what you have to say, old man.
24091	What would you have of me?”Two things,” the old man said.
24092	“Winterfell, and your life.
24093	Command your men to open the gates and lay down their arms.
24094	Those who murdered no children shall be free to walk away, but you shall be held for King Robb’s justice.
24095	May the gods take pity on you when he returns.
24096	”Robb will never look on Winterfell again,” Theon promised.
24097	“He will break himself on Moat Cailin, as every southron army has done for ten thousand years.
24098	We hold the north now, ser.
24099	”You hold three castles,” replied Ser Rodrik, “and this one I mean to take back, Turncloak.
24100	” Theon ignored that.
24101	“Here are my terms.
24102	You have until evenfall to disperse.
24103	Those who swear fealty to Balon Greyjoy as their king and to myself as Prince of Winterfell will be confirmed in their rights and properties and suffer no harm.
24104	Those who defy us will be destroyed.
24105	” Young Cerwyn was incredulous.
24106	“Are you mad, Greyjoy?” Ser Rodrik shook his head.
24107	“Only vain, lad.
24108	Theon has always had too lofty an opinion of himself, I fear.
24109	” The old man jabbed a finger at him.
24110	“Do not imagine that I need wait for Robb to fight his way up the Neck to deal with the likes of you.
24111	I have near two thousand men with me.
24112	and if the tales be true, you have no more than fifty.
24113	” Seventeen, in truth.
24114	Theon made himself smile.
24115	“I have something better than men.
24116	” And he raised a fist over his head, the signal Black Lorren had been told to watch for.
24117	The walls of Winterfell were behind him, but Ser Rodrik faced them squarely and could not fail to see.
24118	Theon watched his face.
24119	When his chin quivered under those stiff white whiskers, he knew just what the old man was seeing.
24120	He is not surprised, he thought with sadness, but the fear is there.
24121	488 “This is craven,” Ser Rodrik said.
24122	“To use a child so.
24123	this is despicable.
24124	”Oh, I know,” said Theon.
24125	“It’s a dish I tasted myself, or have you forgotten? I was ten when I was taken from my father’s house, to make certain he would raise no more rebellions.
24126	”It is not the same!” Theon’s face was impassive.
24127	“The noose I wore was not made of hempen rope, that’s true enough, but I felt it all the same.
24128	And it chafed, Ser Rodrik.
24129	It chafed me raw.
24130	” He had never quite realized that until now, but as the words came spilling out he saw the truth of them.
24131	“No harm was ever done you.
24132	”And no harm will be done your Beth, so long as you—” Ser Rodrik never gave him the chance to finish.
24133	“Viper,” the knight declared, his face red with rage beneath those white whiskers.
24134	“I gave you the chance to save your men and die with some small shred of honor, Turncloak.
24135	I should have known that was too much to ask of a childkiller.
24136	” His hand went to the hilt of his sword.
24137	“I ought cut you down here and now and put an end to your lies and deceits.
24138	By the gods, I should.
24139	” Theon did not fear a doddering old man, but those watching archers and that line of knights were a different matter.
24140	If the swords came out his chances of getting back to the castle alive were small to none.
24141	“Forswear your oath and murder me, and you will watch your little Beth strangle at the end of a rope.
24142	” Ser Rodrik’s knuckles had gone white, but after a moment he took his hand off the swordhilt.
24143	“Truly, I have lived too long.
24144	”I will not disagree, ser.
24145	Will you accept my terms?”I have a duty to Lady Catelyn and House Stark.
24146	”And your own House? Beth is the last of your blood.
24147	” The old knight drew himself up straight.
24148	“I offer myself in my daughter’s place.
24149	Release her, and take me as your hostage.
24150	Surely the castellan of Winterfell is worth more than a child.
24151	”Not to me.
24152	” A valiant gesture, old man, but I am not that great a fool.
24153	“Not to Lord Manderly or Leobald Tallhart either, I’d wager.
24154	” Your sorry old skin is worth no more to them than any other man’s.
24155	“No, I’ll keep the girl.
24156	and keep her safe, so long as you do as I’ve commanded you.
24157	Her life is in your hands.
24158	”Gods be good, Theon, how can you do this? You know I must attack, have sworn.
24159	”If this host is still in arms before my gate when the sun sets, Beth will hang,” said Theon.
24160	“Another hostage will follow her to the grave at first light, and another at sunset.
24161	Every dawn and every dusk will mean a death, until you are gone.
24162	I have no lack of hostages.
24163	” He did not wait for a reply, but wheeled Smiler around and rode back toward the castle.
24164	He went slowly at first, but the thought of those archers at his back soon drove him to a canter.
24165	The small heads watched him come from their spikes, their tarred and flayed faces looming larger with every yard:: between them stood little Beth Cassel, noosed and crying.
24166	Theon put his heel into Smiler and broke into a hard gallop.
24167	Smiler’s hooves clattered on the drawbridge, like drumbeats.
24168	In the yard he dismounted and handed his reins to Wex.
24169	“It may stay them,” he told Black Lorren.
24170	“We’ll know by sunset.
24171	Take the girl in till then, and keep her somewhere safe.
24172	” Under the layers of leather, steel, and wool, he was slick with sweat.
24173	“I need a cup of wine.
24174	A vat of wine would do even better.
24175	” 489 A fire had been laid in Ned Stark’s bedchamber.
24176	Theon sat beside it and filled a cup with a heavy-bodied red from the castle vaults, a wine as sour as his mood.
24177	They will attack, he thought gloomily, staring at the flames.
24178	Ser Rodrik loves his daughter, but he is still castellan, and most of all a knight.
24179	Had it been Theon with a noose around his neck and Lord Balon commanding the army without, the warhorns would already have sounded the attack, he had no doubt.
24180	He should thank the gods that Ser Rodrik was not ironborn.
24181	The men of the green lands were made of softer stuff, though he was not certain they would prove soft enough.
24182	If not, if the old man gave the command to storm the castle regardless, Winterfell would fall:: Theon entertained no delusions on that count.
24183	His seventeen might kill three, four, five times their own number, but in the end they would be overwhelmed.
24184	Theon stared at the flames over the rim of his wine goblet, brooding on the injustice of it all.
24185	“I rode beside Robb Stark in the Whispering Wood,” he muttered.
24186	He had been frightened that night, but not like this.
24187	It was one thing to go into battle surrounded by friends, and another to perish alone and despised.
24188	Mercy, he thought miserably.
24189	When the wine brought no solace, Theon sent Wex to fetch his bow and took himself to the old inner ward.
24190	There he stood, loosing shaft after shaft at the archery butts until his shoulders ached and his fingers were bloody, pausing only long enough to pull the arrows from the targets for another round.
24191	I saved Bran’s life with this bow, he reminded himself.
24192	Would that I could save my own.
24193	Women came to the well, but did not linger:: whatever they saw on Theon’s face sent them away quickly.
24194	Behind him the broken tower stood, its summit as jagged as a crown where fire had collapsed the upper stories long ago.
24195	As the sun moved, the shadow of the tower moved as well, gradually lengthening, a black arm reaching out for Theon Greyjoy.
24196	By the time the sun touched the wall, he was in its grasp.
24197	If I hang the girl, the northmen will attack at once, he thought as he loosed a shaft.
24198	If I do not hang her, they will know my threats are empty.
24199	He knocked another arrow to his bow.
24200	There is no way out, none.
24201	“If you had a hundred archers as good as yourself, you might have a chance to hold the castle,” a voice said softly.
24202	When he turned, Maester Luwin was behind him.
24203	“Go away,” Theon told him.
24204	“I have had enough of your counsel.
24205	”And life? Have you had enough of that, my lord prince?” He raised the bow.
24206	“One more word and I’ll put this shaft through your heart.
24207	”You won’t.
24208	” Theon bent the bow, drawing the grey goose feathers back to his cheek.
24209	“Care to make a wager?”I am your last hope, Theon.
24210	” I have no hope, he thought.
24211	Yet he lowered the bow half an inch and said, “I will not run.
24212	”I do not speak of running.
24213	Take the black.
24214	”The Night’s Watch?” Theon let the bow unbend slowly and pointed the arrow at the ground.
24215	“Ser Rodrik has served House Stark all his life, and House Stark has always been a friend to the Watch.
24216	He will not deny you.
24217	Open your gates, lay down your arms, accept his terms, and he must let you take the black.
24218	” A brother of the Night’s Watch.
24219	It meant no crown, no sons, no wife.
24220	but it meant life, and life with honor.
24221	Ned Stark’s own brother had chosen the Watch, and Jon Snow as well.
24222	490 I have black garb aplenty, once I tear the krakens off.
24223	Even my horse is black.
24224	I could rise high in the Watch—chief of rangers, likely even Lord Commander.
24225	Let Asha keep the bloody islands, they’re as dreary as she is.
24226	If I served at Eastwatch, I could command my own ship, and there’s fine hunting beyond the Wall.
24227	As for women, what wildling woman wouldn’t want a prince in her bed? A slow smile crept across his face.
24228	A black cloak can’t be turned.
24229	I’d be as good as any man.
24230	“PRINCE THEON!” The sudden shout shattered his daydream.
24231	Kromm was loping across the ward.
24232	“The northmen—” He felt a sudden sick sense of dread.
24233	“Is it the attack?” Maester Luwin clutched his arm.
24234	“There’s still time.
24235	Raise a peace banner—”They’re fighting,” Kromm said urgently.
24236	“More men came up, hundreds of them, and at first they made to join the others.
24237	But now they’ve fallen on them!”Is it Asha?” Had she come to save him after all? But Kromm gave a shake of his head.
24238	“No.
24239	These are northmen, I tell you.
24240	With a bloody man on their banner.
24241	” The flayed man of the Dreadfort.
24242	Reek had belonged to the Bastard of Bolton before his capture, Theon recalled.
24243	It was hard to believe that a vile creature like him could sway the Boltons to change their allegiance, but nothing else made sense.
24244	“I’ll see this for myself,” Theon said.
24245	Maester Luwin trailed after him.
24246	By the time they reached the battlements, dead men and dying horses were strewn about the market square outside the gates.
24247	He saw no battle lines, only a swirling chaos of banners and blades.
24248	Shouts and screams rang through the cold autumn air.
24249	Ser Rodrik seemed to have the numbers, but the Dreadfort men were better led, and had taken the others unawares.
24250	Theon watched them charge and wheel and charge again, chopping the larger force to bloody pieces every time they tried to form up between the houses.
24251	He could hear the crash of iron axeheads on oaken shields over the terrified trumpeting of a maimed horse.
24252	The inn was burning, he saw.
24253	Black Lorren appeared beside him and stood silently for a time.
24254	The sun was low in the west, painting the fields and houses all a glowing red.
24255	A thin wavering cry of pain drifted over the walls, and a warhorn sounded off beyond the burning houses.
24256	Theon watched a wounded man drag himself painfully across the ground, smearing his life’s blood in the dirt as he struggled to reach the well that stood at the center of the market square.
24257	He died before he got there.
24258	He wore a leather jerkin and conical half-helm, but no badge to tell which side he’d fought on.
24259	The crows came in the blue dust, with the evening stars.
24260	“The Dothraki believe the stars are spirits of the valiant dead,” Theon said.
24261	Maester Luwin had told him that, a long time ago.
24262	“Dothraki?”The horselords across the narrow sea.
24263	”Oh.
24264	Them.
24265	” Black Lorren frowned through his beard.
24266	“Savages believe all manner of foolish things.
24267	” As the night grew darker and the smoke spread it was harder to make out what was happening below, but the din of steel gradually diminished to nothing, and the shouts and warhorns gave way to moans and piteous wailing.
24268	Finally a column of mounted men rode out of the drifting smoke.
24269	At their head was a knight in dark armor.
24270	His rounded helm gleamed a sullen red, and a pale pink cloak streamed from his shoulders.
24271	Outside the main gate he reined up, and one of his men shouted for the castle to open.
24272	491 “Are you friend or foe?” Black Lorren bellowed down.
24273	“Would a foe bring such fine gifts?” Red Helm waved a hand, and three corpses were dumped in front of the gates.
24274	A torch was waved above the bodies, so the defenders upon the walls might see the faces of the dead.
24275	“The old castellan,” said Black Lorren.
24276	“With Leobald Tallhart and Cley Cerwyn.
24277	” The boy lord had taken an arrow in the eye, and Ser Rodrik had lost his left arm at the elbow.
24278	Maester Luwin gave a wordless cry of dismay, turned away from the battlements, and fell to his knees sick.
24279	“The great pig Manderly was too craven to leave White Harbor, or we would have brought him as well,” shouted Red Helm.
24280	I am saved, Theon thought.
24281	So why did he feel so empty? This was victory, sweet victory, the deliverance he had prayed for.
24282	He glanced at Maester Luwin.
24283	To think how close I came to yielding, and taking the black.
24284	“Open the gates for our friends.
24285	” Perhaps tonight Theon would sleep without fear of what his dreams might bring.
24286	The Dreadfort men made their way across the moat and through the inner gates.
24287	Theon descended with Black Lorren and Maester Luwin to meet them in the yard.
24288	Pale red pennons trailed from the ends of a few lances, but many more carried battle-axes and greatswords and shields hacked half to splinters.
24289	“How many men did you lose?” Theon asked Red Helm as he dismounted.
24290	“Twenty or thirty.
24291	” The torchlight glittered off the chipped enamel of his visor.
24292	His helm and gorget were wrought in the shape of a man’s face and shoulders, skinless and bloody, mouth open in a silent howl of anguish.
24293	“Ser Rodrik had you five-to-one.
24294	”Aye, but he thought us friends.
24295	A common mistake.
24296	When the old fool gave me his hand, I took half his arm instead.
24297	Then I let him see my face.
24298	” The man put both hands to his helm and lifted it off his head, holding it in the crook of his arm.
24299	“Reek,” Theon said, disquieted.
24300	How did a serving man get such fine armor? The man laughed.
24301	“The wretch is dead.
24302	” He stepped closer.
24303	“The girl’s fault.
24304	If she had not run so far, his horse would not have lamed, and we might have been able to flee.
24305	I gave him mine when I saw the riders from the ridge.
24306	I was done with her by then, and he liked to take his turn while they were still warm.
24307	I had to pull him off her and shove my clothes into his hands—calfskin boots and velvet doublet, silver-chased swordbelt, even my sable cloak.
24308	Ride for the Dreadfort, I told him, bring all the help you can.
24309	Take my horse, he’s swifter, and here, wear the ring my father gave me, so they’ll know you came from me.
24310	He’d learned better than to question me.
24311	By the time they put that arrow through his back, I’d smeared myself with the girl’s filth and dressed in his rags.
24312	They might have hanged me anyway, but it was the only chance I saw.
24313	” He rubbed the back of his hand across his mouth.
24314	“And now, my sweet prince, there was a woman promised me, if I brought two hundred men.
24315	Well, I brought three times as many, and no green boys nor field hands neither, but my father’s own garrison.
24316	” Theon had given his word.
24317	This was not the time to flinch.
24318	Pay him his pound of flesh and deal with him later.
24319	“Harrag,” he said, “go to the kennels and bring Palla out for.
24320	?”Ramsay.
24321	” There was a smile on his plump lips, but none in those pale pale eyes.
24322	“Snow, my wife called me before she ate her fingers, but I say Bolton.
24323	” His smile curdled.
24324	“So you’d offer me a kennel girl for my good service, is that the way of it?” 492 There was a tone in his voice Theon did not like, no more than he liked the insolent way the Dreadfort men were looking at him.
24325	“She was what was promised.
24326	”She smells of dogshit.
24327	I’ve had enough of bad smells, as it happens.
24328	I think I’ll have your bed-warmer instead.
24329	What do you call her? Kyra?”Are you mad?” Theon said angrily.
24330	“I’ll have you—” The Bastard’s backhand caught him square, and his cheekbone shattered with a sickening crunch beneath the lobstered steel.
24331	The world vanished in a red roar of pain.
24332	Sometime later, Theon found himself on the ground.
24333	He rolled onto his stomach and swallowed a mouthful of blood.
24334	Close the gates! he tried to shout, but it was too late.
24335	The Dreadfort men had cut down Red Rolfe and Kenned, and more were pouring through, a river of mail and sharp swords.
24336	There was a ringing in his ears, and horror all around him.
24337	Black Lorren had his sword out, but there were already four of them pressing in on him.
24338	He saw Ulf go down with a crossbow bolt through the belly as he ran for the Great Hall.
24339	Maester Luwin was trying to reach him when a knight on a warhorse planted a spear between his shoulders, then swung back to ride over him.
24340	Another man whipped a torch round and round his head and then lofted it toward the thatched roof of the stables.
24341	“Save me the Freys,” the Bastard was shouting as the flames roared upward, “and burn the rest.
24342	Burn it, burn it all.
24343	” The last thing Theon Greyjoy saw was Smiler, kicking free of the burning stables with his mane ablaze, screaming, rearing.
24344	CHAPTER SIXTY-SEVEN TYRION He dreamed of a cracked stone ceiling and the smells of blood and shit and burnt flesh.
24345	The air was full of acrid smoke.
24346	Men were groaning and whimpering all around him, and from time to time a scream would pierce the air, thick with pain.
24347	When he tried to move, he found that he had fouled his own bedding.
24348	The smoke in the air made his eyes water.
24349	Am I crying? He must not let his father see.
24350	He was a Lannister of Casterly Rock.
24351	A lion, I must be a lion, live a lion, die a lion.
24352	He hurt so much, though.
24353	Too weak to groan, he lay in his own filth and shut his eyes.
24354	Nearby someone was cursing the gods in a heavy, monotonous voice.
24355	He listened to the blasphemies and wondered if he was dying.
24356	After a time the room faded.
24357	He found himself outside the city, walking through a world without color.
24358	Ravens soared through a grey sky on wide black wings, while carrion crows rose from their feasts in furious clouds wherever he set his steps.
24359	White maggots burrowed through black corruption.
24360	The wolves were grey, and so were the silent sisters:: together they stripped the flesh from the fallen.
24361	There were corpses strewn all over the tourney fields.
24362	The sun was a hot white penny, shining down upon the grey river as it rushed around the charred bones of sunken ships.
24363	From the pyres of the dead rose black columns of smoke and white-hot ashes.
24364	My work, thought Tyrion Lannister.
24365	They died at my command.
24366	At first there was no sound in the world, but after a time he began to hear the voices of the dead, soft and terrible.
24367	They wept and moaned, they begged for an end to pain, they cried for help and wanted their mothers.
24368	Tyrion had never known his mother.
24369	He wanted Shae, but she was not there.
24370	He walked alone amidst grey shadows, trying to remember.
24371	The silent sisters were stripping the dead men of their armor and clothes.
24372	All the bright dyes had leached out from the surcoats of the slain:: they were garbed in shades of white and grey, and their blood was black and crusty.
24373	He watched their naked bodies lifted by arm and leg, to be carried swinging to the pyres to join their fellows.
24374	Metal and cloth were thrown in the back of a white wooden wagon, pulled by two tall black horses.
24375	493 So many dead, so very many.
24376	Their corpses hung limply, their faces slack or stiff or swollen with gas, unrecognizable, hardly human.
24377	The garments the sisters took from them were decorated with black hearts, grey lions, dead flowers, and pale ghostly stags.
24378	Their armor was all dented and gashed, the chain-mail riven, broken, slashed.
24379	Why did I kill them all? He had known once, but somehow he had forgotten.
24380	He would have asked one of the silent sisters, but when he tried to speak he found he had no mouth.
24381	Smooth seamless skin covered his teeth.
24382	The discovery terrified him.
24383	How could he live without a mouth? He began to run.
24384	The city was not far.
24385	He would be safe inside the city, away from all these dead.
24386	He did not belong with the dead.
24387	He had no mouth, but he was still a living man.
24388	No, a lion, a lion, and alive.
24389	But when he reached the city walls, the gates were shut against him.
24390	It was dark when he woke again.
24391	At first he could see nothing, but after a time the vague outlines of a bed appeared around him.
24392	The drapes were drawn, but he could see the shape of carved bedposts, and the droop of the velvet canopy over his head.
24393	Under him was the yielding softness of a featherbed, and the pillow beneath his head was goose down.
24394	My own bed, I am in my own bed, in my own bedchamber.
24395	It was warm inside the drapes, under the great heap of furs and blankets that covered him.
24396	He was sweating.
24397	Fever, he thought groggily.
24398	He felt so weak, and the pain stabbed through him when he struggled to lift his hand.
24399	He gave up the effort.
24400	His head felt enormous, as big as the bed, too heavy to raise from the pillow.
24401	His body he could scarcely feel at all.
24402	How did I come here? He tried to remember.
24403	The battle came back in fits and flashes.
24404	The fight along the river, the knight who’d offered up his gauntlet, the bridge of ships.
24405	Ser Mandon.
24406	He saw the dead empty eyes, the reaching hand, the green fire shining against the white enamel plate.
24407	Fear swept over him in a cold rush:: beneath the sheets he could feel his bladder letting go.
24408	He would have cried out, if he’d had a mouth.
24409	No, that was the dream, he thought, his head pounding.
24410	Help me, someone help me.
24411	Jaime, Shae, Mother, someone.
24412	Tysha.
24413	No one heard.
24414	No one came.
24415	Alone in the dark, he fell back into piss-scented sleep.
24416	He dreamed his sister was standing over his bed, with their lord father beside her, frowning.
24417	It had to be a dream, since Lord Tywin was a thousand leagues away, fighting Robb Stark in the west.
24418	Others came and went as well.
24419	Varys looked down on him and sighed, but Littlefinger made a quip.
24420	Bloody treacherous bastard, Tyrion thought venomously, we sent you to Bitterbridge and you never came back.
24421	Sometimes he could hear them talking to one another, but he did not understand the words.
24422	Their voices buzzed in his ears like wasps muffled in thick felt.
24423	He wanted to ask if they’d won the battle.
24424	We must have, else I’d be a head on a spike somewhere.
24425	If I live, we won.
24426	He did not know what pleased him more: the victory, or the fact he had been able to reason it out.
24427	His wits were coming back to him, however slowly.
24428	That was good.
24429	His wits were all he had.
24430	The next time he woke, the draperies had been pulled back, and Podrick Payne stood over him with a candle.
24431	When he saw Tyrion open his eyes he ran off.
24432	No, don’t go, help me, help, he tried to call, but the best he could do was a muffled moan.
24433	I have no mouth.
24434	He raised a hand to his face, his every movement pained and fumbling.
24435	His fingers found stiff cloth where they should have found flesh, lips, teeth.
24436	Linen.
24437	The lower half of his face was bandaged tightly, a mask of hardened plaster with holes for breathing and feeding.
24438	A short while later Pod reappeared.
24439	This time a stranger was with him, a maester chained and robed.
24440	“My lord, you must be still,” the man murmured.
24441	“You are grievous hurt.
24442	You will do yourself great injury.
24443	Are you thirsty?” 494 He managed an awkward nod.
24444	The maester inserted a curved copper funnel through the feeding hole over his mouth and poured a slow trickle down his throat.
24445	Tyrion swallowed, scarcely tasting.
24446	Too late he realized the liquid was milk of the poppy.
24447	By the time the maester removed the funnel from his mouth, he was already spiraling back to sleep.
24448	This time he dreamed he was at a feast, a victory feast in some great hall.
24449	He had a high seat on the dais, and men were lifting their goblets and hailing him as hero.
24450	Marillion was there, the singer who’d journeyed with them through the Mountains of the Moon.
24451	He played his woodharp and sang of the Imp’s daring deeds.
24452	Even his father was smiling with approval.
24453	When the song was over, Jaime rose from his place, commanded Tyrion to kneel, and touched him first on one shoulder and then on the other with his golden sword, and he rose up a knight.
24454	Shae was waiting to embrace him.
24455	She took him by the hand, laughing and teasing, calling him her giant of Lannister.
24456	He woke in darkness to a cold empty room.
24457	The draperies had been drawn again.
24458	Something felt wrong, turned around, though he could not have said what.
24459	He was alone once more.
24460	Pushing back the blankets, he tried to sit, but the pain was too much and he soon subsided, breathing raggedly.
24461	His face was the least part of it.
24462	His right side was one huge ache, and a stab of pain went through his chest whenever he lifted his arm.
24463	What’s happened to me? Even the battle seemed half a dream when he tried to think back on it.
24464	I was hurt more badly than I knew.
24465	Ser Mandon.
24466	The memory frightened him, but Tyrion made himself hold it, turn it in his head, stare at it hard.
24467	He tried to kill me, no mistake.
24468	That part was not a dream.
24469	He would have cut me in half if Pod had not.
24470	Pod, where’s Pod? Gritting his teeth, he grabbed hold of the bed hangings and yanked.
24471	The drapes ripped free of the canopy overhead and tumbled down, half on the rushes and half on him.
24472	Even that small effort had dizzied him.
24473	The room whirled around him, all bare walls and dark shadows, with a single narrow window.
24474	He saw a chest he’d owned, an untidy pile of his clothing, his battered armor.
24475	This is not my bedchamber, he realized.
24476	Not even the Tower of the Hand.
24477	Someone had moved him.
24478	His shout of anger came out as a muffled moan.
24479	They have moved me here to die, he thought as he gave up the struggle and closed his eyes once more.
24480	The room was dank and cold, and he was burning.
24481	He dreamed of a better place, a snug little cottage by the sunset sea.
24482	The walls were lopsided and cracked and the floor had been made of packed earth, but he had always been warm there, even when they let the fire go out.
24483	She used to tease me about that, he remembered.
24484	I never thought to feed the fire, that had always been a servant’s task.
24485	“We have no servants,” she would remind me, and I would say, “You have me, I’m your servant,” and she would say, “A lazy servant.
24486	What do they do with lazy servants in Casterly Rock, my lord?” and he would tell her, “They kiss them.
24487	” That would always make her giggle.
24488	“They do not neither.
24489	They beat them, I bet,” she would say, but he would insist, “No, they kiss them, just like this.
24490	” He would show her how.
24491	“They kiss their fingers first, every one, and they kiss their wrists, yes, and inside their elbows.
24492	Then they kiss their funny ears, all our servants have funny ears.
24493	Stop laughing! And they kiss their cheeks and they kiss their noses with the little bump in them, there, so, like that, and they kiss their sweet brows and their hair and their lips, their.
24494	mmmm.
24495	mouths.
24496	so.
24497	” They would kiss for hours, and spend whole days doing no more than lolling in bed, listening to the waves, and touching each other.
24498	Her body was a wonder to him, and she seemed to find delight in his.
24499	Sometimes she would sing to him.
24500	I loved a maid as fair as summer, with sunlight in her hair.
24501	“I love you, Tyrion,” she would whisper before they went to sleep at night.
24502	“I love your lips.
24503	I love your voice, and the words you say to me, and how you treat me gentle.
24504	I love your face.
24505	” 495 “My face?”Yes.
24506	Yes.
24507	I love your hands, and how you touch me.
24508	Your cock, I love your cock, I love how it feels when it’s in me.
24509	”It loves you too, my lady.
24510	”I love to say your name.
24511	Tyrion Lannister.
24512	It goes with mine.
24513	Not the Lannister, t’other part.
24514	Tyrion and Tysha.
24515	Tysha and Tyrion.
24516	Tyrion.
24517	My lord Tyrion.
24518	” Lies, he thought, all feigned, all for gold, she was a whore, Jaime’s whore, Jaime’s gift, my lady of the lie.
24519	Her face seemed to fade away, dissolving behind a veil of tears, but even after she was gone he could still hear the faint, far-off sound of her voice, calling his name.
24520	“.
24521	my lord, can you hear me? My lord? Tyrion? My lord? My lord?” Through a haze of poppied sleep, he saw a soft pink face leaning over him.
24522	He was back in the dank room with the torn bed hangings, and the face was wrong, not hers, too round, with a brown fringe of beard.
24523	“Do you thirst, my lord? I have your milk, your good milk.
24524	You must not fight, no, don’t try to move, you need your rest.
24525	” He had the copper funnel in one damp pink hand and a flask in the other.
24526	As the man leaned close, Tyrion’s fingers slid underneath his chain of many metals, grabbed, pulled.
24527	The maester dropped the flask, spilling milk of the poppy all over the blanket.
24528	Tyrion twisted until he could feel the links digging into the flesh of the man’s fat neck.
24529	“No.
24530	More,” he croaked, so hoarse he was not certain he had even spoken.
24531	But he must have, for the maester choked out a reply.
24532	“Unhand, please, my lord.
24533	need your milk, the pain.
24534	the chain, don’t, unhand, no.
24535	” The pink face was beginning to purple when Tyrion let go.
24536	The maester reeled back, sucking in air.
24537	His reddened throat showed deep white gouges where the links had pressed.
24538	His eyes were white too.
24539	Tyrion raised a hand to his face and made a ripping motion over the hardened mask.
24540	And again.
24541	And again.
24542	“You.
24543	you want the bandages off, is that it?” the maester said at last.
24544	“But I’m not to.
24545	that would be.
24546	be most unwise, my lord.
24547	You are not yet healed, the queen would.
24548	” The mention of his sister made Tyrion growl.
24549	Are you one of hers, then? He pointed a finger at the maester, then coiled his hand into a fist.
24550	Crushing, choking, a promise, unless the fool did as he was bid.
24551	Thankfully, he understood.
24552	“I.
24553	I will do as my lord commands, to be sure, but.
24554	this is unwise, your wounds.
24555	”Do.
24556	It.
24557	” Louder that time.
24558	Bowing, the man left the room, only to return a few moments later, bearing a long knife with a slender saw-tooth blade, a basin of water, a pile of soft cloths, and several flasks.
24559	By then Tyrion had managed to squirm backward a few inches, so he was half-sitting against his pillow.
24560	The maester bade him be very still as he slid the tip of the knife in under his chin, beneath the mask.
24561	A slip of the hand here, and Cersei will be free of me, he thought.
24562	He could feel the blade sawing through the stiffened linen, only inches above his throat.
24563	Fortunately this soft pink man was not one of his sister’s braver creatures.
24564	After a moment he felt cool air on his cheeks.
24565	There was pain as well, but he did his best to ignore that.
24566	The maester discarded the bandages, still crusty with potion.
24567	“Be still now, I must wash out the wound.
24568	” His touch was gentle, the water warm and soothing.
24569	The wound, Tyrion thought, remembering a sudden flash of bright silver that seemed to pass just below his eyes.
24570	“This is like to sting some,” the maester warned as he wet a cloth with wine that smelled of 496 crushed herbs.
24571	It did more than sting.
24572	It traced a line of fire all the way across Tyrion’s face, and twisted a burning poker up his nose.
24573	His fingers clawed the bedclothes and he sucked in his breath, but somehow he managed not to scream.
24574	The maester was clucking like an old hen.
24575	“It would have been wiser to leave the mask in place until the flesh had knit, my lord.
24576	Still, it looks clean, good, good.
24577	When we found you down in that cellar among the dead and dying, your wounds were filthy.
24578	One of your ribs was broken, doubtless you can feel it, the blow of some mace perhaps, or a fall, it’s hard to say.
24579	And you took an arrow in the arm, there where it joins the shoulder.
24580	It showed signs of mortification, and for a time I feared you might lose the limb, but we treated it with boiling wine and maggots, and now it seems to be healing clean.
24581	”Name,” Tyrion breathed up at him.
24582	“Name.
24583	” The maester blinked.
24584	“Why, you are Tyrion Lannister, my lord.
24585	Brother to the queen.
24586	Do you remember the battle? Sometimes with head wounds—”Your name.
24587	” His throat was raw, and his tongue had forgotten how to shape the words.
24588	“I am Maester Ballabar.
24589	”Ballabar,” Tyrion repeated.
24590	“Bring me.
24591	Looking glass.
24592	”My lord,” the maester said, “I would not counsel.
24593	that might be, ah, unwise, as it were.
24594	your wound.
24595	”Bring it,” he had to say.
24596	His mouth was stiff and sore, as if a punch had split his lip.
24597	“And drink.
24598	Wine.
24599	No poppy.
24600	” The maester rose flush-faced and hurried off.
24601	He came back with a flagon of pale amber wine and a small silvered looking glass in an ornate golden frame.
24602	Sitting on the edge of the bed, he poured half a cup of wine and held it to Tyrion’s swollen lips.
24603	The trickle went down cool, though he could hardly taste it.
24604	“More,” he said when the cup was empty.
24605	Maester Ballabar poured again.
24606	By the end of the second cup, Tyrion Lannister felt strong enough to face his face.
24607	He turned over the glass, and did not know whether he ought to laugh or cry.
24608	The gash was long and crooked, starting a hair under his left eye and ending on the right side of his jaw.
24609	Three-quarters of his nose was gone, and a chunk of his lip.
24610	Someone had sewn the torn flesh together with catgut, and their clumsy stitches were still in place across the seam of raw, red, half-healed flesh.
24611	“Pretty,” he croaked, flinging the glass aside.
24612	He remembered now.
24613	The bridge of boats, Ser Mandon Moore, a hand, a sword coming at his face.
24614	If I had not pulled back, that cut would have taken off the top of my head.
24615	Jaime had always said that Ser Mandon was the most dangerous of the Kingsguard, because his dead empty eyes gave no hint to his intentions.
24616	I should never have trusted any of them.
24617	He’d known that Ser Meryn and Ser Boros were his sister’s, and Ser Osmund later, but he had let himself believe that the others were not wholly lost to honor.
24618	Cersei must have paid him to see that I never came back from the battle.
24619	Why else? I never did Ser Mandon any harm that I know of.
24620	Tyrion touched his face, plucking at the proud flesh with blunt thick fingers.
24621	Another gift from my sweet sister.
24622	The maester stood beside the bed like a goose about to take flight.
24623	“My lord, there, there will most like be a scar.
24624	”Most like?” His snort of laughter turned into a wince of pain.
24625	There would be a scar, to be sure.
24626	Nor was it likely that his nose would be growing back any time soon.
24627	It was not as if his face had ever been fit to look at.
24628	“Teach me, not to, play with, axes.
24629	” His grin felt tight.
24630	“Where, are we? What, what place?” It hurt to talk, but Tyrion had been too long in silence.
24631	497 “Ah, you are in Maegor’s Holdfast, my lord.
24632	A chamber over the Queen’s Ballroom.
24633	Her Grace wanted you kept close, so she might watch over you herself.
24634	” I’ll wager she did.
24635	“Return me,” Tyrion commanded.
24636	“Own bed.
24637	Own chambers.
24638	” Where I will have my own men about me, and my own maester too, if I find one I can trust.
24639	“Your own.
24640	my lord, that would not be possible.
24641	The King’s Hand has taken up residence in your former chambers.
24642	”I.
24643	Am.
24644	King’s Hand.
24645	” He was growing exhausted by the effort of speaking, and confused by what he was hearing.
24646	Maester Ballabar looked distressed.
24647	“No, my lord, I.
24648	you were wounded, near death.
24649	Your lord father has taken up those duties now.
24650	Lord Tywin, he.
24651	”Here?”Since the night of the battle.
24652	Lord Tywin saved us all.
24653	The smallfolk say it was King Renly’s ghost, but wiser men know better.
24654	It was your father and Lord Tyrell, with the Knight of Flowers and Lord Littlefinger.
24655	They rode through the ashes and took the usurper Stannis in the rear.
24656	It was a great victory, and now Lord Tywin has settled into the Tower of the Hand to help His Grace set the realm to rights, gods be praised.
24657	”Gods be praised,” Tyrion repeated hollowly.
24658	His bloody father and bloody Littlefinger and Renly’s ghost? “I want.
24659	” Who do I want? He could not tell pink Ballabar to fetch him Shae.
24660	Who could he send for, who could he trust? Varys? Bronn? Ser Jacelyn? “.
24661	my squire,” he finished.
24662	“Pod.
24663	Payne.
24664	” It was Pod on the bridge of boats, the lad saved my life.
24665	“The boy? The odd boy?”Odd boy.
24666	Podrick.
24667	Payne.
24668	You go.
24669	Send him.
24670	”As you will, my lord.
24671	” Maester Ballabar bobbed his head and hurried out.
24672	Tyrion could feel the strength seeping out of him as he waited.
24673	He wondered how long he had been here, asleep.
24674	Cersei would have me sleep forever, but I won’t be so obliging.
24675	Podrick Payne entered the bedchamber timid as a mouse.
24676	“My lord?” He crept close to the bed.
24677	How can a boy so bold in battle be so frightened in a sickroom? Tyrion wondered.
24678	“I meant to stay by you, but the maester sent me away.
24679	”Send him away.
24680	Hear me.
24681	Talk’s hard.
24682	Need dreamwine.
24683	Dreamwine, not milk of the poppy.
24684	Go to Frenken.
24685	Frenken, not Ballabar.
24686	Watch him make it.
24687	Bring it here.
24688	” Pod stole a glance at Tyrion’s face, and just as quickly averted his eyes.
24689	Well, I cannot blame him for that.
24690	“I want,” Tyrion went on, “mine own.
24691	Guard.
24692	Bronn.
24693	Where’s Bronn?”They made him a knight.
24694	” Even frowning hurt.
24695	“Find him.
24696	Bring him.
24697	”As you say.
24698	My lord.
24699	Bronn.
24700	” Tyrion seized the lad’s wrist.
24701	“Ser Mandon?” The boy flinched.
24702	“I n-never meant to k-k-k-k—”Dead? You’re, certain? Dead?” He shuffled his feet, sheepish.
24703	“Drowned.
24704	”Good.
24705	Say nothing.
24706	Of him.
24707	Of me.
24708	Any of it.
24709	Nothing.
24710	” By the time his squire left, the last of Tyrion’s strength was gone as well.
24711	He lay back and closed his eyes.
24712	Perhaps he would dream of Tysha again.
24713	I wonder how she’d like my face now, he thought bitterly.
24714	498 CHAPTER SIXTY-EIGHT JON When Qhorin Halfhand told him to find some brush for a fire, Jon knew their end was near.
24715	It will be good to feel warm again, if only for a little while, he told himself while he hacked bare branches from the trunk of a dead tree.
24716	Ghost sat on his haunches watching, silent as ever.
24717	Will he howl for me when I’m dead, as Bran’s wolf howled when he fell? Jon wondered.
24718	Will Shaggydog howl, far off in Winterfell, and Grey Wind and Nymeria, wherever they might be? The moon was rising behind one mountain and the sun sinking behind another as Jon struck sparks from flint and dagger, until finally a wisp of smoke appeared.
24719	Qhorin came and stood over him as the first flame rose up flickering from the shavings of bark and dead dry pine needles.
24720	“As shy as a maid on her wedding night,” the big ranger said in a soft voice, “and near as fair.
24721	Sometimes a man forgets how pretty a fire can be.
24722	” He was not a man you’d expect to speak of maids and wedding nights.
24723	So far as Jon knew, Qhorin had spent his whole life in the Watch.
24724	Did he ever love a maid or have a wedding? He could not ask.
24725	Instead he fanned the fire.
24726	When the blaze was all a-crackle, he peeled off his stiff gloves to warm his hands, and sighed, wondering if ever a kiss had felt as good.
24727	The warmth spread through his fingers like melting butter.
24728	The Halfhand eased himself to the ground and sat cross-legged by the fire, the flickering light playing across the hard planes of his face.
24729	Only the two of them remained of the five rangers who had fled the Skirling Pass, back into the blue-grey wilderness of the Frostfangs.
24730	At first Jon had nursed the hope that Squire Dalbridge would keep the wildlings bottled up in the pass.
24731	But when they’d heard the call of a far-off horn every man of them knew the squire had fallen.
24732	Later they spied the eagle soaring through the dusk on great blue-grey wings and Stonesnake unslung his bow, but the bird flew out of range before he could so much as string it.
24733	Ebben spat and muttered darkly of wargs and skinchangers.
24734	They glimpsed the eagle twice more the day after, and heard the hunting horn behind them echoing against the mountains.
24735	Each time it seemed a little louder, a little closer.
24736	When night fell, the Halfhand told Ebben to take the squire’s garron as well as his own, and ride east for Mormont with all haste, back the way they had come.
24737	The rest of them would draw off the pursuit.
24738	“Send Jon,” Ebben had urged.
24739	“He can ride as fast as me.
24740	”Jon has a different part to play.
24741	”He is half a boy still.
24742	”No,” said Qhorin, “he is a man of the Night’s Watch.
24743	” When the moon rose, Ebben parted from them.
24744	Stonesnake went east with him a short way, then doubled back to obscure their tracks, and the three who remained set off toward the southwest.
24745	After that the days and nights blurred one into the other.
24746	They slept in their saddles and stopped only long enough to feed and water the garrons, then mounted up again.
24747	Over bare rock they rode, through gloomy pine forests and drifts of old snow, over icy ridges and across shallow rivers that had no names.
24748	Sometimes Qhorin or Stonesnake would loop back to sweep away their tracks, but it was a futile gesture.
24749	They were watched.
24750	At every dawn and every dusk they saw the eagle soaring between the peaks, no more than a speck in the vastness of the sky.
24751	499 They were scaling a low ridge between two snowcapped peaks when a shadowcat came snarling from its lair, not ten yards away.
24752	The beast was gaunt and half-starved, but the sight of it sent Stonesnake’s mare into a panic:: she reared and ran, and before the ranger could get her back under control she had stumbled on the steep slope and broken a leg.
24753	Ghost ate well that day, and Qhorin insisted that the rangers mix some of the garron’s blood with their oats, to give them strength.
24754	The taste of that foul porridge almost choked Jon, but he forced it down.
24755	They each cut a dozen strips of raw stringy meat from the carcass to chew on as they rode, and left the rest for the shadowcats.
24756	There was no question of riding double.
24757	Stonesnake offered to lay in wait for the pursuit and surprise them when they came.
24758	Perhaps he could take a few of them with him down to hell.
24759	Qhorin refused.
24760	“If any man in the Night’s Watch can make it through the Frostfangs alone and afoot, it is you, brother.
24761	You can go over mountains that a horse must go around.
24762	Make for the Fist.
24763	Tell Mormont what Jon saw, and how.
24764	Tell him that the old powers are waking, that he faces giants and wargs and worse.
24765	Tell him that the trees have eyes again.
24766	” He has no chance, Jon thought when he watched Stonesnake vanish over a snow-covered ridge, a tiny black bug crawling across a rippling expanse of white.
24767	After that, every night seemed colder than the night before, and more lonely.
24768	Ghost was not always with them, but he was never far either.
24769	Even when they were apart, Jon sensed his nearness.
24770	He was glad for that.
24771	The Halfhand was not the most companionable of men.
24772	Qhorin’s long grey braid swung slowly with the motion of his horse.
24773	Often they would ride for hours without a word spoken, the only sounds the soft scrape of horseshoes on stone and the keening of the wind, which blew endlessly through the heights.
24774	When he slept, he did not dream:: not of wolves, nor his brothers, nor anything.
24775	Even dreams cannot live up here, he told himself.
24776	“Is your sword sharp, Jon Snow?” asked Qhorin Halfhand across the flickering fire.
24777	“My sword is Valyrian steel.
24778	The Old Bear gave it to me.
24779	”Do you remember the words of your vow?”Yes.
24780	” They were not words a man was like to forget.
24781	Once said, they could never be unsaid.
24782	They changed your life forever.
24783	“Say them again with me, Jon Snow.
24784	”If you like.
24785	” Their voices blended as one beneath the rising moon, while Ghost listened and the mountains themselves bore witness.
24786	“Night gathers, and now my watch begins.
24787	It shall not end until my death.
24788	I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.
24789	I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.
24790	I shall live and die at my post.
24791	I am the sword in the darkness.
24792	I am the watcher on the walls.
24793	I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men.
24794	I pledge my life and honor to the Night’s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.
24795	” When they were done, there was no sound but the faint crackle of the flames and a distant sigh of wind.
24796	Jon opened and closed his burnt fingers, holding tight to the words in his mind, praying that his father’s gods would give him the strength to die bravely when his hour came.
24797	It would not be long now.
24798	The garrons were near the end of their strength.
24799	Qhorin’s mount would not last another day, Jon suspected.
24800	The flames were burning low by then, the warmth fading.
24801	“The fire will soon go out,” Qhorin said, “but if the Wall should ever fall, all the fires will go out.
24802	” There was nothing Jon could say to that.
24803	He nodded.
24804	“We may escape them yet,” the ranger said.
24805	“Or not.
24806	” 500 “I’m not afraid to die.
24807	” It was only half a lie.
24808	“It may not be so easy as that, Jon.
24809	” He did not understand.
24810	“What do you mean?”If we are taken, you must yield.
24811	”Yield?” He blinked in disbelief.
24812	The wildlings did not make captives of the men they called the crows.
24813	They killed them, except for.
24814	“They only spare oathbreakers.
24815	Those who join them, like Mance Rayder.
24816	”And you.
24817	”No.
24818	” He shook his head.
24819	“Never.
24820	I won’t.
24821	”You will.
24822	I command it of you.
24823	”Command it? But.
24824	”Our honor means no more than our lives, so long as the realm is safe.
24825	Are you a man of the Night’s Watch?”Yes, but—”There is no but, Jon Snow.
24826	You are, or you are not.
24827	” Jon sat up straight.
24828	“I am.
24829	”Then hear me.
24830	If we are taken, you will go over to them, as the wildling girl you captured once urged you.
24831	They may demand that you cut your cloak to ribbons, that you swear them an oath on your father’s grave, that you curse your brothers and your Lord Commander.
24832	You must not balk, whatever is asked of you.
24833	Do as they bid you.
24834	but in your heart, remember who and what you are.
24835	Ride with them, eat with them, fight with them, for as long as it takes.
24836	And watch.
24837	”For what?” Jon asked.
24838	“Would that I knew,” said Qhorin.
24839	“Your wolf saw their diggings in the valley of the Milkwater.
24840	What did they seek, in such a bleak and distant place? Did they find it? That is what you must learn, before you return to Lord Mormont and your brothers.
24841	That is the duty I lay on you, Jon Snow.
24842	”I’ll do as you say,” Jon said reluctantly, “but.
24843	you will tell them, won’t you? The Old Bear, at least? You’ll tell him that I never broke my oath.
24844	” Qhorin Halfhand gazed at him across the fire, his eyes lost in pools of shadow.
24845	“When I see him next.
24846	I swear it.
24847	” He gestured at the fire.
24848	“More wood.
24849	I want it bright and hot.
24850	” Jon went to cut more branches, snapping each one in two before tossing it into the flames.
24851	The tree had been dead a long time, but it seemed to live again in the fire, as fiery dancers woke within each stick of wood to whirl and spin in their glowing gowns of yellow, red, and orange.
24852	“Enough,” Qhorin said abruptly.
24853	“Now we ride.
24854	”Ride?” It was dark beyond the fire, and the night was cold.
24855	“Ride where?”Back.
24856	” Qhorin mounted his weary garron one more time.
24857	“The fire will draw them past, I hope.
24858	Come, brother.
24859	” Jon pulled on his gloves again and raised his hood.
24860	Even the horses seemed reluctant to leave the fire.
24861	The sun was long gone, and only the cold silver shine of the half-moon remained to light their way over the treacherous ground that lay behind them.
24862	He did not know what Qhorin had in mind, but perhaps it was a chance.
24863	He hoped so.
24864	I do not want to play the oathbreaker, even for good reason.
24865	501 They went cautiously, moving as silent as man and horse could move, retracing their steps until they reached the mouth of a narrow defile where an icy little stream emerged from between two mountains.
24866	Jon remembered the place.
24867	They had watered the horses here before the sun went down.
24868	“The water’s icing up,” Qhorin observed as he turned aside, “else we’d ride in the streambed.
24869	But if we break the ice, they are like to see.
24870	Keep close to the cliffs.
24871	There’s a crook a half mile on that will hide us.
24872	” He rode into the defile.
24873	Jon gave one last wistful look to their distant fire, and followed.
24874	The farther in they went, the closer the cliffs pressed to either side.
24875	They followed the moonlit ribbon of stream back toward its source.
24876	Icicles bearded its stony banks, but Jon could still hear the sound of rushing water beneath the thin hard crust.
24877	A great jumble of fallen rock blocked their way partway up, where a section of the cliffface had fallen, but the surefooted little garrons were able to pick their way through.
24878	Beyond, the walls pinched in sharply, and the stream led them to the foot of a tall twisting waterfall.
24879	The air was full of mist, like the breath of some vast cold beast.
24880	The tumbling waters shone silver in the moonlight.
24881	Jon looked about in dismay.
24882	There is no way out.
24883	He and Qhorin might be able to climb the cliffs, but not with the horses.
24884	He did not think they would last long afoot.
24885	“Quickly now,” the Halfhand commanded.
24886	The big man on the small horse rode over the ice-slick stones, right into the curtain of water, and vanished.
24887	When he did not reappear, Jon put his heels into his horse and went after.
24888	His garron did his best to shy away.
24889	The falling water slapped at them with frozen fists, and the shock of the cold seemed to stop Jon’s breath.
24890	Then he was through:: drenched and shivering, but through.
24891	The cleft in the rock was barely large enough for man and horse to pass, but beyond, the walls opened up and the floor turned to soft sand.
24892	Jon could feel the spray freezing in his beard.
24893	Ghost burst through the waterfall in an angry rush, shook droplets from his fur, sniffed at the darkness suspiciously, then lifted a leg against one rocky wall.
24894	Qhorin had already dismounted.
24895	Jon did the same.
24896	“You knew this place was here.
24897	”When I was no older than you, I heard a brother tell how he followed a shadowcat through these falls.
24898	” He unsaddled his horse, removed her bit and bridle, and ran his fingers through her shaggy mane.
24899	“There is a way through the heart of the mountain.
24900	Come dawn, if they have not found us, we will press on.
24901	The first watch is mine, brother.
24902	” Qhorin seated himself on the sand, his back to a wall, no more than a vague black shadow in the gloom of the cave.
24903	Over the rush of falling waters, Jon heard a soft sound of steel on leather that could only mean that the Halfhand had drawn his sword.
24904	He took off his wet cloak, but it was too cold and damp here to strip down any further.
24905	Ghost stretched out beside him and licked his glove before curling up to sleep.
24906	Jon was grateful for his warmth.
24907	He wondered if the fire was still burning outside, or if it had gone out by now.
24908	If the Wall should ever fall, all the fires will go out.
24909	The moon shone through the curtain of falling water to lay a shimmering pale stripe across the sand, but after a time that too faded and went dark.
24910	Sleep came at last, and with it nightmares.
24911	He dreamed of burning castles and dead men rising unquiet from their graves.
24912	It was still dark when Qhorin woke him.
24913	While the Halfhand slept, Jon sat with his back to the cave wall, listening to the water and waiting for the dawn.
24914	At break of day, they each chewed a half-frozen strip of horsemeat, then saddled their garrons once again, and fastened their black cloaks around their shoulders.
24915	During his watch the Halfhand had made a half-dozen torches, soaking bundles of dry moss with the oil he 502 carried in his saddlebag.
24916	He lit the first one now and led the way down into the dark, holding the pale flame up before him.
24917	Jon followed with the horses.
24918	The stony path twisted and turned, first down, then up, then down more steeply.
24919	In spots it grew so narrow it was hard to convince the garrons they could squeeze through.
24920	By the time we come out we will have lost them, he told himself as they went.
24921	Not even an eagle can see through solid stone.
24922	We will have lost them, and we will ride hard for the Fist, and tell the Old Bear all we know.
24923	But when they emerged back into the light long hours later, the eagle was waiting for them, perched on a dead tree a hundred feet up the slope.
24924	Ghost went bounding up the rocks after it, but the bird flapped its wings and took to the air.
24925	Qhorin’s mouth tightened as he followed its flight with his eyes.
24926	“Here is as good a place as any to make a stand,” he declared.
24927	“The mouth of the cave shelters us from above, and they cannot get behind us without passing through the mountain.
24928	Is your sword sharp, Jon Snow?”Yes,” he said.
24929	“We’ll feed the horses.
24930	They’ve served us bravely, poor beasts.
24931	” Jon gave his garron the last of the oats and stroked his shaggy mane while Ghost prowled restlessly amongst the rocks.
24932	He pulled his gloves on tighter and flexed his burnt fingers.
24933	I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
24934	A hunting horn echoed through the mountains, and a moment later Jon heard the baying of hounds.
24935	“They will be with us soon,” announced Qhorin.
24936	“Keep your wolf in hand.
24937	”Ghost, to me,” Jon called.
24938	The direwolf returned reluctantly to his side, tail held stiffly behind him.
24939	The wildlings came boiling over a ridge not half a mile away.
24940	Their hounds ran before them, snarling grey-brown beasts with more than a little wolf in their blood.
24941	Ghost bared his teeth, his fur bristling.
24942	“Easy,” Jon murmured.
24943	“Stay.
24944	” Overhead he heard a rustle of wings.
24945	The eagle landed on an outcrop of rock and screamed in triumph.
24946	The hunters approached warily, perhaps fearing arrows.
24947	Jon counted fourteen, with eight dogs.
24948	Their large round shields were made of skins stretched over woven wicker and painted with skulls.
24949	About half of them hid their faces behind crude helms of wood and boiled leather.
24950	On either wing, archers notched shafts to the strings of small wood-and-horn bows, but did not loose.
24951	The rest seemed to be armed with spears and mauls.
24952	One had a chipped stone axe.
24953	They wore only what bits of armor they had looted from dead rangers or stolen during raids.
24954	Wildlings did not mine or smelt, and there were few smiths and fewer forges north of the Wall.
24955	Qhorin drew his longsword.
24956	The tale of how he had taught himself to fight with his left hand after losing half of his right was part of his legend:: it was said that he handled a blade better now than he ever had before.
24957	Jon stood shoulder to shoulder with the big ranger and pulled Longclaw from its sheath.
24958	Despite the chill in the air, sweat stung his eyes.
24959	Ten yards below the cave mouth the hunters halted.
24960	Their leader came on alone, riding a beast that seemed more goat than horse, from the surefooted way it climbed the uneven slope.
24961	As man and mount grew nearer Jon could hear them clattering:: both were armored in bones.
24962	Cow bones, sheep bones, the bones of goats and aurochs and elk, the great bones of the hairy mammoths.
24963	and human bones as well.
24964	“Rattleshirt,” Qhorin called down, icy-polite.
24965	“To crows I be the Lord o’ Bones.
24966	” The rider’s helm was made from the broken skull of a giant, and all up and down his arms bearclaws had been sewn to his boiled leather.
24967	503 Qhorin snorted.
24968	“I see no lord.
24969	Only a dog dressed in chickenbones, who rattles when he rides.
24970	” The wildling hissed in anger, and his mount reared.
24971	He did rattle, Jon could hear it:: the bones were strung together loosely, so they clacked and clattered when he moved.
24972	“It’s your bones I’ll be rattling soon, Halfhand.
24973	I’ll boil the flesh off you and make a byrnie from your ribs.
24974	I’ll carve your teeth to cast me runes, and eat me oaten porridge from your skull.
24975	”If you want my bones, come get them.
24976	” That, Rattleshirt seemed reluctant to do.
24977	His numbers meant little in the close confines of the rocks where the black brothers had taken their stand:: to winkle them out of the cave the wildlings would need to come up two at a time.
24978	But another of his company edged a horse up beside him, one of the fighting women called spearwives.
24979	“We are four-and-ten to two, crows, and eight dogs to your wolf,” she called.
24980	“Fight or run, you are ours.
24981	”Show them,” commanded Rattleshirt.
24982	The woman reached into a bloodstained sack and drew out a trophy.
24983	Ebben had been bald as an egg, so she dangled the head by an ear.
24984	“He died brave,” she said.
24985	“But he died,” said Rattleshirt, “same like you.
24986	” He freed his battleaxe, brandishing it above his head.
24987	Good steel it was, with a wicked gleam to both blades:: Ebben was never a man to neglect his weapons.
24988	The other wildlings crowded forward beside him, yelling taunts.
24989	A few chose Jon for their mockery.
24990	“Is that your wolf, boy?” a skinny youth called, unlimbering a stone flail.
24991	“He’ll be my cloak before the sun is down.
24992	” On the other side of the line, another spearwife opened her ragged furs to show Jon a heavy white breast.
24993	“Does the baby want his momma? Come, have a suck o’ this, boy.
24994	” The dogs were barking too.
24995	“They would shame us into folly.
24996	” Qhorin gave Jon a long look.
24997	“Remember your orders.
24998	”Belike we need to flush the crows,” Rattleshirt bellowed over the clamor.
24999	“Feather them!”No!” The word burst from Jon’s lips before the bowmen could loose.
25000	He took two quick steps forward.
25001	“We yield!”They warned me bastard blood was craven,” he heard Qhorin Halfhand say coldly behind him.
25002	“I see it is so.
25003	Run to your new masters, coward.
25004	” Face reddening, Jon descended the slope to where Rattleshirt sat his horse.
25005	The wildling stared at him through the eyeholes of his helm, and said, “The free folk have no need of cravens.
25006	”He is no craven.
25007	” One of the archers pulled off her sewn sheepskin helm and shook out a head of shaggy red hair.
25008	“This is the Bastard o’ Winterfell, who spared me.
25009	Let him live.
25010	” Jon met Ygritte’s eyes, and had no words.
25011	“Let him die,” insisted the Lord of Bones.
25012	“The black crow is a tricksy bird.
25013	I trust him not.
25014	” On a rock above them, the eagle flapped its wings and split the air with a scream of fury.
25015	“The bird hates you, Jon Snow,” said Ygritte.
25016	“And well he might.
25017	He was a man, before you killed him.
25018	”I did not know,” said Jon truthfully, trying to remember the face of the man he had slain in the pass.
25019	“You told me Mance would take me.
25020	”And he will,” Ygritte said.
25021	“Mance is not here,” said Rattleshirt.
25022	“Ragwyle, gut him.
25023	” 504 The big spearwife narrowed her eyes and said, “If the crow would join the free folk, let him show us his prowess and prove the truth of him.
25024	”I’ll do whatever you ask.
25025	” The words came hard, but Jon said them.
25026	Rattleshirt’s bone armor clattered loudly as he laughed.
25027	“Then kill the Halfhand, bastard.
25028	”As if he could,” said Qhorin.
25029	“Turn, Snow, and die.
25030	” And then Qhorin’s sword was coming at him and somehow Longclaw leapt upward to block.
25031	The force of impact almost knocked the bastard blade from Jon’s hand, and sent him staggering backward.
25032	You must not balk, whatever is asked of you.
25033	He shifted to a two-hand grip, quick enough to deliver a stroke of his own, but the big ranger brushed it aside with contemptuous ease.
25034	Back and forth they went, black cloaks swirling, the youth’s quickness against the savage strength of Qhorin’s left-hand cuts.
25035	The Halfhand’s longsword seemed to be everywhere at once, raining down from one side and then the other, driving him where he would, keeping him off balance.
25036	Already he could feel his arms growing numb.
25037	Even when Ghost’s teeth closed savagely around the ranger’s calf, somehow Qhorin kept his feet.
25038	But in that instant, as he twisted, the opening was there.
25039	Jon planted and pivoted.
25040	The ranger was leaning away, and for an instant it seemed that Jon’s slash had not touched him.
25041	Then a string of red tears appeared across the big man’s throat, bright as a ruby necklace, and the blood gushed out of him, and Qhorin Halfhand fell.
25042	Ghost’s muzzle was dripping red, but only the point of the bastard blade was stained, the last half inch.
25043	Jon pulled the direwolf away and knelt with one arm around him.
25044	The light was already fading in Qhorin’s eyes.
25045	“.
25046	sharp,” he said, lifting his maimed fingers.
25047	Then his hand fell, and he was gone.
25048	He knew, he thought numbly.
25049	He knew what they would ask of me.
25050	He thought of Samwell Tarly then, of Grenn and Dolorous Edd, of Pyp and Toad back at Castle Black.
25051	Had he lost them all, as he had lost Bran and Rickon and Robb? Who was he now? What was he? “Get him up.
25052	” Rough hands dragged him to his feet.
25053	Jon did not resist.
25054	“Do you have a name?” Ygritte answered for him.
25055	“His name is Jon Snow.
25056	He is Eddard Stark’s blood, of Winterfell.
25057	” Ragwyle laughed.
25058	“Who would have thought it? Qhorin Halfhand slain by some lordling’s by-blow.
25059	”Gut him.
25060	” That was Rattleshirt, still ahorse.
25061	The eagle flew to him and perched atop his bony helm, screeching.
25062	“He yielded,” Ygritte reminded them.
25063	“Aye, and slew his brother,” said a short homely man in a rust-eaten iron half-helm.
25064	Rattleshirt rode closer, bones clattering.
25065	“The wolf did his work for him.
25066	It were foully done.
25067	The Halfhand’s death was mine.
25068	”We all saw how eager you were to take it,” mocked Ragwyle.
25069	“He is a warg,” said the Lord of Bones, “and a crow.
25070	I like him not.
25071	”A warg he may be,” Ygritte said, “but that has never frightened us.
25072	” Others shouted agreement.
25073	Behind the eyeholes of his yellowed skull Rattleshirt’s stare was malignant, but he yielded grudgingly.
25074	These are a free folk indeed, thought Jon.
25075	They burned Qhorin Halfhand where he’d fallen, on a pyre made of pine needles, brush, and broken branches.
25076	Some of the wood was still green, and it burned slow and smoky, 505 sending a black plume up into the bright hard blue of the sky.
25077	Afterward Rattleshirt claimed some charred bones, while the others threw dice for the ranger’s gear.
25078	Ygritte won his cloak.
25079	“Will we return by the Skirling Pass?” Jon asked her.
25080	He did not know if he could face those heights again, or if his garron could survive a second crossing.
25081	“No,” she said.
25082	“There’s nothing behind us.
25083	” The look she gave him was sad.
25084	“By now Mance is well down the Milkwater, marching on your Wall.
25085	” CHAPTER SIXTY-NINE BRAN The ashes fell like a soft grey snow.
25086	He padded over dry needles and brown leaves, to the edge of the wood where the pines grew thin.
25087	Beyond the open fields he could see the great piles of man-rock stark against the swirling flames.
25088	The wind blew hot and rich with the smell of blood and burnt meat, so strong he began to slaver.
25089	Yet as one smell drew them onward, others warned them back.
25090	He sniffed at the drifting smoke.
25091	Men, many men, many horses, and fire, fire, fire.
25092	No smell was more dangerous, not even the hard cold smell of iron, the stuff of man-claws and hardskin.
25093	The smoke and ash clouded his eyes, and in the sky he saw a great winged snake whose roar was a river of flame.
25094	He bared his teeth, but then the snake was gone.
25095	Behind the cliffs tall fires were eating up the stars.
25096	All through the night the fires crackled, and once there was a great roar and a crash that made the earth jump under his feet.
25097	Dogs barked and whined and horses screamed in terror.
25098	Howls shuddered through the night:: the howls of the man-pack, wails of fear and wild shouts, laughter and screams.
25099	No beast was as noisy as man.
25100	He pricked up his ears and listened, and his brother growled at every sound.
25101	They prowled under the trees as a piney wind blew ashes and embers through the sky.
25102	In time the flames began to dwindle, and then they were gone.
25103	The sun rose grey and smoky that morning.
25104	Only then did he leave the trees, stalking slow across the fields.
25105	His brother ran with him, drawn to the smell of blood and death.
25106	They padded silent through the dens the men had built of wood and grass and mud.
25107	Many and more were burned and many and more were collapsed:: others stood as they had before.
25108	Yet nowhere did they see or scent a living man.
25109	Crows blanketed the bodies and leapt into the air screeching when his brother and he came near.
25110	The wild dogs slunk away before them.
25111	Beneath the great grey cliffs a horse was dying noisily, struggling to rise on a broken leg and screaming when he fell.
25112	His brother circled round him, then tore out his throat while the horse kicked feebly and rolled his eyes.
25113	When he approached the carcass his brother snapped at him and laid back his ears, and he cuffed him with a forepaw and bit his leg.
25114	They fought amidst the grass and dirt and falling ashes beside the dead horse, until his brother rolled on his back in submission, tail tucked low.
25115	One more bite at his upturned throat:: then he fed, and let his brother feed, and licked the blood off his black fur.
25116	The dark place was pulling at him by then, the house of whispers where all men were blind.
25117	He could feel its cold fingers on him.
25118	The stony smell of it was a whisper up the nose.
25119	He struggled against the pull.
25120	He did not like the darkness.
25121	He was wolf.
25122	He was hunter and stalker and slayer, and he belonged with his brothers and sisters in the deep woods, running free beneath a starry sky.
25123	He sat on his haunches, raised his head, and howled.
25124	I will not go, he cried.
25125	I am wolf, I will not go.
25126	Yet even so the darkness thickened, until it covered his eyes and filled his nose and stopped his ears, so he could not see or smell or hear or run, and the 506 grey cliffs were gone and the dead horse was gone and his brother was gone and all was black and still and black and cold and black and dead and black.
25127	“Bran,” a voice was whispering softly.
25128	“Bran, come back.
25129	Come back now, Bran.
25130	Bran.
25131	” He closed his third eye and opened the other two, the old two, the blind two.
25132	In the dark place all men were blind.
25133	But someone was holding him.
25134	He could feel arms around him, the warmth of a body snuggled close.
25135	He could hear Hodor singing “Hodor, hodor, hodor,” quietly to himself.
25136	“Bran?” It was Meera’s voice.
25137	“You were thrashing, making terrible noises.
25138	What did you see?”Winterfell.
25139	” His tongue felt strange and thick in his mouth.
25140	One day when I come back I won’t know how to talk anymore.
25141	“It was Winterfell.
25142	It was all on fire.
25143	There were horse smells, and steel, and blood.
25144	They killed everyone, Meera.
25145	” He felt her hand on his face, stroking back his hair.
25146	“You’re all sweaty,” she said.
25147	“Do you need a drink?”A drink,” he agreed.
25148	She held a skin to his lips, and Bran swallowed so fast the water ran out of the corner of his mouth.
25149	He was always weak and thirsty when he came back.
25150	And hungry too.
25151	He remembered the dying horse, the taste of blood in his mouth, the smell of burnt flesh in the morning air.
25152	“How long?”Three days,” said Jojen.
25153	The boy had come up soft-foot, or perhaps he had been there all along:: in this blind black world, Bran could not have said.
25154	“We were afraid for you.
25155	”I was with Summer,” Bran said.
25156	“Too long.
25157	You’ll starve yourself.
25158	Meera dribbled a little water down your throat, and we smeared honey on your mouth, but it is not enough.
25159	”I ate,” said Bran.
25160	“We ran down an elk and had to drive off a treecat that tried to steal him.
25161	” The cat had been tan-and-brown, only half the size of the direwolves, but fierce.
25162	He remembered the musky smell of him, and the way he had snarled down at them from the limb of the oak.
25163	“The wolf ate,” Jojen said.
25164	“Not you.
25165	Take care, Bran.
25166	Remember who you are.
25167	” He remembered who he was all too well:: Bran the boy, Bran the broken.
25168	Better Bran the beastling.
25169	Was it any wonder he would sooner dream his Summer dreams, his wolf dreams? Here in the chill damp darkness of the tomb his third eye had finally opened.
25170	He could reach Summer whenever he wanted, and once he had even touched Ghost and talked to Jon.
25171	Though maybe he had only dreamed that.
25172	He could not understand why Jojen was always trying to pull him back now.
25173	Bran used the strength of his arms to squirm to a sitting position.
25174	“I have to tell Osha what I saw.
25175	Is she here? Where did she go?” The wildling woman herself gave answer.
25176	“Nowhere, m’lord.
25177	I’ve had my fill o’ blundering in the black.
25178	” He heard the scrape of a heel on stone, turned his head toward the sound, but saw nothing.
25179	He thought he could smell her, but he wasn’t sure.
25180	All of them stank alike, and he did not have Summer’s nose to tell one from the other.
25181	“Last night I pissed on a king’s foot,” Osha went on.
25182	“Might be it was morning, who can say? I was sleeping, but now I’m not.
25183	” They all slept a lot, not only Bran.
25184	There was nothing else to do.
25185	Sleep and eat and sleep again, and sometimes talk a little.
25186	but not too much, and only in whispers, just to be safe.
25187	Osha might have liked it better if they had never talked at all, but there was no way to quiet Rickon, or to stop Hodor from muttering, “Hodor, hodor, hodor,” endlessly to himself.
25188	507 “Osha,” Bran said, “I saw Winterfell burning.
25189	” Off to his left, he could hear the soft sound of Rickon’s breathing.
25190	“A dream,” said Osha.
25191	“A wolf dream,” said Bran.
25192	“I smelled it too.
25193	Nothing smells like fire, or blood.
25194	”Whose blood?”Men, horses, dogs, everyone.
25195	We have to go see.
25196	”This scrawny skin of mine’s the only one I got,” said Osha.
25197	“That squid prince catches hold o’ me, they’ll strip it off my back with a whip.
25198	” Meera’s hand found Bran’s in the darkness and gave his fingers a squeeze.
25199	“I’ll go if you’re afraid.
25200	” Bran heard fingers fumbling at leather, followed by the sound of steel on flint.
25201	Then again.
25202	A spark flew, caught.
25203	Osha blew softly.
25204	A long pale flame awoke, stretching upward like a girl on her toes.
25205	Osha’s face floated above it.
25206	She touched the flame with the head of a torch.
25207	Bran had to squint as the pitch began to burn, filling the world with orange glare.
25208	The light woke Rickon, who sat up yawning.
25209	When the shadows moved, it looked for an instant as if the dead were rising as well.
25210	Lyanna and Brandon, Lord Rickard Stark their father, Lord Edwyle his father, Lord Willam and his brother Artos the Implacable, Lord Donnor and Lord Beron and Lord Rodwell, oneeyed Lord Jonnel, Lord Barth and Lord Brandon and Lord Cregan who had fought the Dragonknight.
25211	On their stone chairs they sat with stone wolves at their feet.
25212	This was where they came when the warmth had seeped out of their bodies:: this was the dark hall of the dead, where the living feared to tread.
25213	And in the mouth of the empty tomb that waited for Lord Eddard Stark, beneath his stately granite likeness, the six fugitives huddled round their little cache of bread and water and dried meat.
25214	“Little enough left,” Osha muttered as she blinked down on their stores.
25215	“I’d need to go up soon to steal food in any case, or we’d be down to eating Hodor.
25216	”Hodor,” Hodor said, grinning at her.
25217	“Is it day or night up there?” Osha wondered.
25218	“I’ve lost all count o’ such.
25219	”Day,” Bran told her, “but it’s dark from all the smoke.
25220	”M’lord is certain?” Never moving his broken body, he reached out all the same, and for an instant he was seeing double.
25221	There stood Osha holding the torch, and Meera and Jojen and Hodor, and the double row of tall granite pillars and long dead lords behind them stretching away into darkness.
25222	but there was Winterfell as well, grey with drifting smoke, the massive oak-andiron gates charred and askew, the drawbridge down in a tangle of broken chains and missing planks.
25223	Bodies floated in the moat, islands for the crows.
25224	“Certain,” he declared.
25225	Osha chewed on that a moment.
25226	“I’ll risk a look then.
25227	I want the lot o’ you close behind.
25228	Meera, get Bran’s basket.
25229	”Are we going home?” Rickon asked excitedly.
25230	“I want my horse.
25231	And I want applecakes and butter and honey, and Shaggy.
25232	Are we going where Shaggydog is?”Yes,” Bran promised, “but you have to be quiet.
25233	” Meera strapped the wicker basket to Hodor’s back and helped lift Bran into it, easing his useless legs through the holes.
25234	He had a queer flutter in his belly.
25235	He knew what awaited them above, but that did not make it any less fearful.
25236	As they set off, he turned to give his father 508 one last look, and it seemed to Bran that there was a sadness in Lord Eddard’s eyes, as if he did not want them to go.
25237	We have to, he thought.
25238	It’s time.
25239	Osha carried her long oaken spear in one hand and the torch in the other.
25240	A naked sword hung down her back, one of the last to bear Mikken’s mark.
25241	He had forged it for Lord Eddard’s tomb, to keep his ghost at rest.
25242	But with Mikken slain and the ironmen guarding the armory, good steel had been hard to resist, even if it meant grave-robbing.
25243	Meera had claimed Lord Rickard’s blade, though she complained that it was too heavy.
25244	Brandon took his namesake’s, the sword made for the uncle he had never known.
25245	He knew he would not be much use in a fight, but even so the blade felt good in his hand.
25246	But it was only a game, and Bran knew it.
25247	Their footsteps echoed through the cavernous crypts.
25248	The shadows behind them swallowed his father as the shadows ahead retreated to unveil other statues:: no mere lords, these, but the old Kings in the North.
25249	On their brows they wore stone crowns.
25250	Torrhen Stark, the King Who Knelt.
25251	Edwyn the Spring King.
25252	Theon Stark, the Hungry Wolf.
25253	Brandon the Burner and Brandon the Shipwright.
25254	Jorah and Jonos, Brandon the Bad, Walton the Moon King, Edderion the Bridegroom, Eyron, Benjen the Sweet and Benjen the Bitter, King Edrick Snowbeard.
25255	Their faces were stern and strong, and some of them had done terrible things, but they were Starks every one, and Bran knew all their tales.
25256	He had never feared the crypts:: they were part of his home and who he was, and he had always known that one day he would lie here too.
25257	But now he was not so certain.
25258	If I go up, will I ever come back down? Where will I go when I die? “Wait,” Osha said when they reached the twisting stone stairs that led up to the surface, and down to the deeper levels where kings more ancient still sat their dark thrones.
25259	She handed Meera the torch.
25260	“I’ll grope my way up.
25261	” For a time they could hear the sound of her footfalls, but they grew softer and softer until they faded away entirely.
25262	“Hodor,” said Hodor nervously.
25263	Bran had told himself a hundred times how much he hated hiding down here in the dark, how much he wanted to see the sun again, to ride his horse through wind and rain.
25264	But now that the moment was upon him, he was afraid.
25265	He’d felt safe in the darkness:: when you could not even find your own hand in front of your face, it was easy to believe that no enemies could ever find you either.
25266	And the stone lords had given him courage.
25267	Even when he could not see them, he had known they were there.
25268	It seemed a long while before they heard anything again.
25269	Bran had begun to fear that something had happened to Osha.
25270	His brother was squirming restlessly.
25271	“I want to go home!” he said loudly.
25272	Hodor bobbed his head and said, “Hodor.
25273	” Then they heard the footsteps again, growing louder, and after a few minutes Osha emerged into the light, looking grim.
25274	“Something is blocking the door.
25275	I can’t move it.
25276	”Hodor can move anything,” said Bran.
25277	Osha gave the huge stableboy an appraising look.
25278	“Might be he can.
25279	Come on, then.
25280	” The steps were narrow, so they had to climb in single file.
25281	Osha led.
25282	Behind came Hodor, with Bran crouched low on his back so his head wouldn’t hit the ceiling.
25283	Meera followed with the torch, and Jojen brought up the rear, leading Rickon by the hand.
25284	Around and around they went, and up and up.
25285	Bran thought he could smell smoke now, but perhaps that was only the torch.
25286	509 The door to the crypts was made of ironwood.
25287	It was old and heavy, and lay at a slant to the ground.
25288	Only one person could approach it at a time.
25289	Osha tried once more when she reached it, but Bran could see that it was not budging.
25290	“Let Hodor try.
25291	” They had to pull Bran from his basket first, so he would not get squished.
25292	Meera squatted beside him on the steps, one arm thrown protectively across his shoulders, as Osha and Hodor traded places.
25293	“Open the door, Hodor,” Bran said.
25294	The huge stableboy put both hands flat on the door, pushed, and grunted.
25295	“Hodor?” He slammed a fist against the wood, and it did not so much as jump.
25296	“Hodor.
25297	”Use your back,” urged Bran.
25298	“And your legs.
25299	” Turning, Hodor put his back to the wood and shoved.
25300	Again.
25301	Again.
25302	“Hodor!” He put one foot on a higher step so he was bent under the slant of the door and tried to rise.
25303	This time the wood groaned and creaked.
25304	“Hodor!” The other foot came up a step, and Hodor spread his legs apart, braced, and straightened.
25305	His face turned red, and Bran could see cords in his neck bulging as he strained against the weight above him.
25306	“Hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor HODOR!” From above came a dull rumble.
25307	Then suddenly the door jerked upward and a shaft of daylight fell across Bran’s face, blinding him for a moment.
25308	Another shove brought the sound of shifting stone, and then the way was open.
25309	Osha poked her spear through and slid out after it, and Rickon squirmed through Meera’s legs to follow.
25310	Hodor shoved the door open all the way and stepped to the surface.
25311	The Reeds had to carry Bran up the last few steps.
25312	The sky was a pale grey, and smoke eddied all around them.
25313	They stood in the shadow of the First Keep, or what remained of it.
25314	One whole side of the building had torn loose and fallen away.
25315	Stone and shattered gargoyles lay strewn across the yard.
25316	They fell just where I did, Bran thought when he saw them.
25317	Some of the gargoyles had broken into so many pieces it made him wonder how he was alive at all.
25318	Nearby some crows were pecking at a body crushed beneath the tumbled stone, but he lay facedown and Bran could not say who he was.
25319	The First Keep had not been used for many hundreds of years, but now it was more of a shell than ever.
25320	The floors had burned inside it, and all the beams.
25321	Where the wall had fallen away, they could see right into the rooms, even into the privy.
25322	Yet behind, the broken tower still stood, no more burned than before.
25323	Jojen Reed was coughing from the smoke.
25324	“Take me home!” Rickon demanded.
25325	“I want to be home!” Hodor stomped in a circle.
25326	“Hodor,” he whimpered in a small voice.
25327	They stood huddled together with ruin and death all around them.
25328	“We made noise enough to wake a dragon,” Osha said, “but there’s no one come.
25329	The castle’s dead and burned, just as Bran dreamed, but we had best—” She broke off suddenly at a noise behind them, and whirled with her spear at the ready.
25330	Two lean dark shapes emerged from behind the broken tower, padding slowly through the rubble.
25331	Rickon gave a happy shout of “Shaggy!” and the black direwolf came bounding toward him.
25332	Summer advanced more slowly, rubbed his head up against Bran’s arm, and licked his face.
25333	“We should go,” said Jojen.
25334	“So much death will bring other wolves besides Summer and Shaggydog, and not all on four feet.
25335	”Aye, soon enough,” Osha agreed, “but we need food, and there may be some survived this.
25336	Stay together.
25337	Meera, keep your shield up and guard our backs.
25338	” It took the rest of the morning to make a slow circuit of the castle.
25339	The great granite walls remained, blackened here and there by fire but otherwise untouched.
25340	But within, all was death and destruction.
25341	The doors of the Great Hall were charred and smoldering, and inside the rafters had given way and the whole roof had crashed down onto the floor.
25342	The green and 510 yellow panes of the glass gardens were all in shards, the trees and fruits and flowers torn up or left exposed to die.
25343	Of the stables, made of wood and thatch, nothing remained but ashes, embers, and dead horses.
25344	Bran thought of his Dancer, and wanted to weep.
25345	There was a shallow steaming lake beneath the Library Tower, and hot water gushing from a crack in its side.
25346	The bridge between the Bell Tower and the rookery had collapsed into the yard below, and Maester Luwin’s turret was gone.
25347	They saw a dull red glow shining up through the narrow cellar windows beneath the Great Keep, and a second fire still burning in one of the storehouses.
25348	Osha called softly through the blowing smoke as they went, but no one answered.
25349	They saw one dog worrying at a corpse, but he ran when he caught the scents of the direwolves:: the rest had been slain in the kennels.
25350	The maester’s ravens were paying court to some of the corpses, while the crows from the broken tower attended others.
25351	Bran recognized Poxy Tym, even though someone had taken an axe to his face.
25352	One charred corpse, outside the ashen shell of Mother’s sept, sat with his arms drawn up and his hands balled into hard black fists, as if to punch anyone who dared approach him.
25353	“If the gods are good,” Osha said in a low angry voice, “the Others will take them that did this work.
25354	”It was Theon,” Bran said blackly.
25355	“No.
25356	Look.
25357	” She pointed across the yard with her spear.
25358	“That’s one of his ironmen.
25359	And there.
25360	And that’s Greyjoy’s warhorse, see? The black one with the arrows in him.
25361	” She moved among the dead, frowning.
25362	“And here’s Black Lorren.
25363	” He had been hacked and cut so badly that his beard looked a reddish-brown now.
25364	“Took a few with him, he did.
25365	” Osha turned over one of the other corpses with her foot.
25366	“There’s a badge.
25367	A little man, all red.
25368	”The flayed man of the Dreadfort,” said Bran.
25369	Summer howled, and darted away.
25370	“The godswood.
25371	” Meera Reed ran after the direwolf, her shield and frog spear to hand.
25372	The rest of them trailed after, threading their way through smoke and fallen stones.
25373	The air was sweeter under the trees.
25374	A few pines along the edge of the wood had been scorched, but deeper in the damp soil and green wood had defeated the flames.
25375	“There is a power in living wood,” said Jojen Reed, almost as if he knew what Bran was thinking, “a power strong as fire.
25376	” On the edge of the black pool, beneath the shelter of the heart tree, Maester Luwin lay on his belly in the dirt.
25377	A trail of blood twisted back through damp leaves where he had crawled.
25378	Summer stood over him, and Bran thought he was dead at first, but when Meera touched his throat, the maester moaned.
25379	“Hodor?” Hodor said mournfully.
25380	“Hodor?” Gently, they eased Luwin onto his back.
25381	He had grey eyes and grey hair, and once his robes had been grey as well, but they were darker now where the blood had soaked through.
25382	“Bran,” he said softly when he saw him sitting tall on Hodor’s back.
25383	“And Rickon too.
25384	” He smiled.
25385	“The gods are good.
25386	I knew.
25387	”Knew?” said Bran uncertainly.
25388	“The legs, I could tell.
25389	the clothes fit, but the muscles in his legs.
25390	poor lad.
25391	” He coughed, and blood came up from inside him.
25392	“You vanished.
25393	in the woods.
25394	how, though?”We never went,” said Bran.
25395	“Well, only to the edge, and then doubled back.
25396	I sent the wolves on to make a trail, but we hid in Father’s tomb.
25397	” 511 “The crypts.
25398	” Luwin chuckled, a froth of blood on his lips.
25399	When the maester tried to move, he gave a sharp gasp of pain.
25400	Tears filled Bran’s eyes.
25401	When a man was hurt you took him to the maester, but what could you do when your maester was hurt? “We’ll need to make a litter to carry him,” said Osha.
25402	“No use,” said Luwin.
25403	“I’m dying, woman.
25404	”You can’t,” said Rickon angrily.
25405	“No you can’t.
25406	” Beside him, Shaggydog bared his teeth and growled.
25407	The maester smiled.
25408	“Hush now, child, I’m much older than you.
25409	I can.
25410	die as I please.
25411	”Hodor, down,” said Bran.
25412	Hodor went to his knees beside the maester.
25413	“Listen,” Luwin said to Osha, “the princes.
25414	Robb’s heirs.
25415	Not.
25416	not together.
25417	do you hear?” The wildling woman leaned on her spear.
25418	“Aye.
25419	Safer apart.
25420	But where to take them? I’d thought, might be these Cerwyns.
25421	” Maester Luwin shook his head, though it was plain to see what the effort cost him.
25422	“Cerwyn boy’s dead.
25423	Ser Rodrik, Leobald Tallhart, Lady Hornwood.
25424	all slain.
25425	Deepwood fallen, Moat Cailin, soon Torrhen’s Square.
25426	Ironmen on the Stony Shore.
25427	And east, the Bastard of Bolton.
25428	”Then where?” asked Osha.
25429	“White Harbor.
25430	the Umbers.
25431	I do not know.
25432	war everywhere.
25433	each man against his neighbor, and winter coming.
25434	such folly, such black mad folly.
25435	” Maester Luwin reached up and grasped Bran’s forearm, his fingers closing with a desperate strength.
25436	“You must be strong now.
25437	Strong.
25438	”I will be,” Bran said, though it was hard.
25439	Ser Rodrik killed and Maester Luwin, everyone, everyone.
25440	“Good,” the maester said.
25441	“A good boy.
25442	Your.
25443	your father’s son, Bran.
25444	Now go.
25445	” Osha gazed up at the weirwood, at the red face carved in the pale trunk.
25446	“And leave you for the gods?”I beg.
25447	” The maester swallowed.
25448	“A.
25449	a drink of water, and.
25450	another boon.
25451	If you would.
25452	”Aye.
25453	” She turned to Meera.
25454	“Take the boys.
25455	” Jojen and Meera led Rickon out between them.
25456	Hodor followed.
25457	Low branches whipped at Bran’s face as they pushed between the trees, and the leaves brushed away his tears.
25458	Osha joined them in the yard a few moments later.
25459	She said no word of Maester Luwin.
25460	“Hodor must stay with Bran, to be his legs,” the wildling woman said briskly.
25461	“I will take Rickon with me.
25462	”We’ll go with Bran,” said Jojen Reed.
25463	“Aye, I thought you might,” said Osha.
25464	“Believe I’ll try the East Gate, and follow the kingsroad a ways.
25465	”We’ll take the Hunter’s Gate,” said Meera.
25466	“Hodor,” said Hodor.
25467	They stopped at the kitchens first.
25468	Osha found some loaves of burned bread that were still edible, and even a cold roast fowl that she ripped in half.
25469	Meera unearthed a crock of honey 512 and a big sack of apples.
25470	Outside, they made their farewells.
25471	Rickon sobbed and clung to Hodor’s leg until Osha gave him a smack with the butt end of her spear.
25472	Then he followed her quick enough.
25473	Shaggydog stalked after them.
25474	The last Bran saw of them was the direwolf’s tail as it vanished behind the broken tower.
25475	The iron portcullis that closed the Hunter’s Gate had been warped so badly by heat it could not be raised more than a foot.
25476	They had to squeeze beneath its spikes, one by one.
25477	“Will we go to your lord father?” Bran asked as they crossed the drawbridge between the walls.
25478	“To Greywater Watch?” Meera looked to her brother for the answer.
25479	“Our road is north,” Jojen announced.
25480	At the edge of the wolfswood, Bran turned in his basket for one last glimpse of the castle that had been his life.
25481	Wisps of smoke still rose into the grey sky, but no more than might have risen from Winterfell’s chimneys on a cold autumn afternoon.
25482	Soot stains marked some of the arrow loops, and here and there a crack or a missing merlon could be seen in the curtain wall, but it seemed little enough from this distance.
25483	Beyond, the tops of the keeps and towers still stood as they had for hundreds of years, and it was hard to tell that the castle had been sacked and burned at all.
25484	The stone is strong, Bran told himself, the roots of the trees go deep, and under the ground the Kings of Winter sit their thrones.
25485	So long as those remained, Winterfell remained.
25486	It was not dead, just broken.
25487	Like me, he thought.
25488	I’m not dead either.

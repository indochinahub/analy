03006	” “What, me as well?” said Tormund.
03007	“No, you especially,” said Mance.
03008	“I eat in no hall where I’m not welcome.
03009	” Tormund got to his feet.
03010	“Me and the hens are leaving.
03011	” He snatched another chicken off the brazier, shoved it into a pocket sewn in the lining of his cloak, said “Har,” and left licking his fingers.
03012	The others followed him out, all but the woman Dalla.
03013	“Sit, if you like,” Rayder said when they were gone.
03014	“Are you hungry? Tormund left us two birds at least.
03015	” “I would be pleased to eat, Your Grace.
03016	And thank you.
03017	” “Your Grace?” The king smiled.
03018	“That’s not a style one often hears from the lips of free folk.
03019	I’m Mance to most, The Mance to some.
03020	Will you take a horn of mead?” “Gladly,” said Jon.
03021	The king poured himself as Dalla cut the well-crisped hens apart and brought them each a half.
03022	Jon peeled off his gloves and ate with his fingers, sucking every morsel of meat off the bones.
03023	“Tormund spoke truly,” said Mance Rayder as he ripped apart a loaf of bread.
03024	“The black crow is a tricksy bird, that’s so.
03025	but I was a crow when you were no bigger than the babe in Dalla’s belly, Jon Snow.
03026	So take care not to play tricksy with me.
03027	” “As you say, Your—Mance.
03028	” The king laughed.
03029	“Your Mance! Why not? I promised you a tale before, of how I knew you.
03030	Have you puzzled it out yet?” Jon shook his head.
03031	“Did Rattleshirt send word ahead?” “By wing? We have no trained ravens.
03032	No, I knew your face.
03033	I’ve seen it before.
03034	Twice.
03035	” It made no sense at first, but as Jon turned it over in his mind, dawn broke.
03036	“When you were a brother of the Watch.
03037	” “Very good! Yes, that was the first time.
03038	You were just a boy, and I was all in black, one of a dozen riding escort to old Lord Commander Qorgyle when he came down to see your father at Winterfell.
03039	I was walking the wall around the yard when I came on you and your brother Robb.
03040	It had snowed the night before, and the two of you had built a great mountain above the gate and were waiting for someone likely to pass underneath.
03041	” “I remember,” said Jon with a startled laugh.
03042	A young black brother on the wallwalk, yes.
03043	“You swore not to tell.
03044	” “And kept my vow.
03045	That one, at least.

03049	html “We dumped the snow on Fat Tom.
03050	He was Father’s slowest guardsman.
03051	” Tom had chased them around the yard afterward, until all three were red as autumn apples.
03052	“But you said you saw me twice.
03053	When was the other time?” “When King Robert came to Winterfell to make your father Hand,” the King-beyond-the-Wall said lightly.
03054	Jon’s eyes widened in disbelief.
03055	“That can’t be so.
03056	” “It was.
03057	When your father learned the king was coming, he sent word to his brother Benjen on the Wall, so he might come down for the feast.
03058	There is more commerce between the black brothers and the free folk than you know, and soon enough word came to my ears as well.
03059	It was too choice a chance to resist.
03060	Your uncle did not know me by sight, so I had no fear from that quarter, and I did not think your father was like to remember a young crow he’d met briefly years before.
03061	I wanted to see this Robert with my own eyes, king to king, and get the measure of your uncle Benjen as well.
03062	He was First Ranger by then, and the bane of all my people.
03063	So I saddled my fleetest horse, and rode.
03064	” “But,” Jon objected, “the Wall.
03065	” “The Wall can stop an army, but not a man alone.
03066	I took a lute and a bag of silver, scaled the ice near Long Barrow, walked a few leagues south of the New Gift, and bought a horse.
03067	All in all I made much better time than Robert, who was traveling with a ponderous great wheelhouse to keep his queen in comfort.
03068	A day south of Winterfell I came up on him and fell in with his company.
03069	Freeriders and hedge knights are always attaching themselves to royal processions, in hopes of finding service with the king, and my lute gained me easy acceptance.
03070	” He laughed.
03071	“I know every bawdy song that’s ever been made, north or south of the Wall.
03072	So there you are.
03073	The night your father feasted Robert, I sat in the back of his hall on a bench with the other freeriders, listening to Orland of Oldtown play the high harp and sing of dead kings beneath the sea.
03074	I betook of your lord father’s meat and mead, had a look at Kingslayer and Imp.
03075	and made passing note of Lord Eddard’s children and the wolf pups that ran at their heels.
03076	” “Bael the Bard,” said Jon, remembering the tale that Ygritte had told him in the Frostfangs, the night he’d almost killed her.
03077	“Would that I were.
03078	I will not deny that Bael’s exploit inspired mine own.
03079	but I did not steal either of your sisters that I recall.
03080	Bael wrote his own songs, and lived them.
03081	I only sing the songs that better men have made.
03082	More mead?” “No,” said Jon.
03083	“if you had been discovered.
03084	taken.
03085	” “Your father would have had my head off.
03086	” The king gave a shrug.
03087	“Though once I had eaten at his board I was protected by guest right.
03088	The laws of hospitality are as old as the First Men, and sacred as a heart tree.
03089	” He gestured at the board between them, the broken bread and chicken bones.
03090	“Here you are the guest, and safe from harm at my hands.
03091	this night, at least.
03092	So tell me truly, Jon Snow.
03093	Are you a craven who turned your cloak from fear, or is there another reason that brings you to my tent?” Guest right or no, Jon Snow knew he walked on rotten ice here.
03094	One false step and he might plunge through, into water cold enough to stop his heart.
03095	Weigh every word before you speak it, he told himself.
03096	He took a long draught of mead to buy time for his answer.

03101	” Mance Rayder smiled, as Jon had hoped he would.
03102	The king was plainly a man who liked the sound of his own voice.
03103	“You will have heard stories of my desertion, I have no doubt.
03104	” “Some say it was for a crown.
03105	Some say for a woman.
03106	Others that you had the wildling blood.
03107	” “The wildling blood is the blood of the First Men, the same blood that flows in the veins of the Starks.
03108	As to a crown, do you see one?” “I see a woman.
03109	” He glanced at Dalla.
03110	Mance took her by the hand and pulled her close.
03111	“My lady is blameless.
03112	I met her on my return from your father’s castle.
03113	The Halfhand was carved of old oak, but I am made of flesh, and I have a great fondness for the charms of women.
03114	which makes me no different from three-quarters of the Watch.
03115	There are men still wearing black who have had ten times as many women as this poor king.
03116	You must guess again, Jon Snow.
03117	” Jon considered a moment.
03118	“The Halfhand said you had a passion for wildling music.
03119	” “I did.
03120	I do.
03121	That’s closer to the mark, yes.
03122	But not a hit.
03123	” Mance Rayder rose, unfastened the clasp that held his cloak, and swept it over the bench.
03124	“It was for this.
03125	” “A cloak?” “The black wool cloak of a Sworn Brother of the Night’s Watch,” said the King-beyond-the-Wall.
03126	“One day on a ranging we brought down a fine big elk.
03127	We were skinning it when the smell of blood drew a shadowcat out of its lair.
03128	I drove it off, but not before it shredded my cloak to ribbons.
03129	Do you see? Here, here, and here?” He chuckled.
03130	“It shredded my arm and back as well, and I bled worse than the elk.
03131	My brothers feared I might die before they got me back to Maester Mullin at the Shadow Tower, so they carried me to a wildling village where we knew an old wisewoman did some healing.
03132	She was dead, as it happened, but her daughter saw to me.
03133	Cleaned my wounds, sewed me up, and fed me porridge and potions until I was strong enough to ride again.
03134	And she sewed up the rents in my cloak as well, with some scarlet silk from Asshai that her grandmother had pulled from the wreck of a cog washed up on theFrozenShore.
03135	It was the greatest treasure she had, and her gift to me.
03136	” He swept the cloak back over his shoulders.
03137	“But at theShadowTower , I was given a new wool cloak from stores, black and black, and trimmed with black, to go with my black breeches and black boots, my black doublet and black mail.
03138	The new cloak had no frays nor rips nor tears.
03139	and most of all, no red.
03140	The men of the Night’s Watch dressed in black, Ser Denys Mallister reminded me sternly, as if I had forgotten.
03141	My old cloak was fit for burning now, he said.
03142	“I left the next morning.
03143	for a place where a kiss was not a crime, and a man could wear any cloak he chose.
03144	” He closed the clasp and sat back down again.
03145	“And you, Jon Snow?” Jon took another swallow of mead.
03146	There is only one tale that he might believe.
03147	“You say you were at Winterfell, the night my father feasted King Robert.
03148	” “I did say it, for I was.
03149	” “Then you saw us all.

03154	You saw them walk the center aisle with every eye upon them and take their seats at the table just below the dais where the king and queen were seated.
03155	” “I remember.
03156	” “And did you see where I was seated, Mance?” He leaned forward.
03157	“Did you see where they put the bastard?” Mance Rayder looked at Jon’s face for a long moment.
03158	“I think we had best find you a new cloak,” the king said, holding out his hand.
03159	Chapter Eight Daenerys Across the still blue water came the slow steady beat of drums and the soft swish of oars from the galleys.
03160	The great cog groaned in their wake, the heavy lines stretched taut between.
03161	Balerion ’s sails hung limp, drooping forlorn from the masts.
03162	Yet even so, as she stood upon the forecastle watching her dragons chase each other across a cloudless blue sky, Daenerys Targaryen was as happy as she could ever remember being.
03163	Her Dothraki called the seathe poison water , distrusting any liquid that their horses could not drink.
03164	On the day the three ships had lifted anchor at Qarth, you would have thought they were sailing to hell instead of Pentos.
03165	Her brave young bloodriders had stared off at the dwindling coastline with huge white eyes, each of the three determined to show no fear before the other two, while her handmaids Irri and Jhiqui clutched the rail desperately and retched over the side at every little swell.
03166	The rest of Dany’s tiny khalasar remained below decks, preferring the company of their nervous horses to the terrifying landless world about the ships.
03167	When a sudden squall had enveloped them six days into the voyage, she heard them through the hatches:: the horses kicking and screaming, the riders praying in thin quavery voices each timeBalerion heaved or swayed.
03168	No squall could frighten Dany, though.
03169	Daenerys Stormborn , she was called, for she had come howling into the world on distant Dragonstone as the greatest storm in the memory of Westeros howled outside, a storm so fierce that it ripped gargoyles from the castle walls and smashed her father’s fleet to kindling.
03170	The narrow sea was often stormy, and Dany had crossed it half a hundred times as a girl, running from one Free City to the next half a step ahead of the Usurper’s hired knives.
03171	She loved the sea.
03172	She liked the sharp salty smell of the air, and the vastness of horizons bounded only by a vault of azure sky above.
03173	It made her feel small, but free as well.
03174	She liked the dolphins that sometimes swam along beside Balerion , slicing through the waves like silvery spears, and the flying fish they glimpsed now and again.
03175	She even liked the sailors, with all their songs and stories.
03176	Once on a voyage to Braavos, as she’d watched the crew wrestle down a great green sail in a rising gale, she had even thought how fine it would be to be a sailor.
03177	But when she told her brother, Viserys had twisted her hair until she cried.
03178	“You are blood of the dragon,” he had screamed at her.
03179	“Adragon , not some smelly fish.
03180	” He was a fool about that, and so much else, Dany thought.
03181	If he had been wiser and more patient, it would be him sailing west to take the throne that was his by rights.
03182	Viserys had been stupid and vicious, she had come to realize, yet sometimes she missed him all the same.
03183	Not the cruel weak man he had become by the end, but the brother who had sometimes let her creep into his bed, the boy who told her tales of the Seven Kingdoms, and talked of how much better their lives would be once he claimed his crown.

03187	html The captain appeared at her elbow.
03188	“Would that thisBalerion could soar as her namesake did, Your Grace,” he said in bastard Valyrian heavily flavored with accents of Pentos.
03189	“Then we should not need to row, nor tow, nor pray for wind.
03190	” “Just so, Captain,” she answered with a smile, pleased to have won the man over.
03191	Captain Groleo was an old Pentoshi like his master, Illyrio Mopatis, and he had been nervous as a maiden about carrying three dragons on his ship.
03192	Half a hundred buckets of seawater still hung from the gunwales, in case of fires.
03193	At first Groleo had wanted the dragons caged and Dany had consented to put his fears at ease, but their misery was so palpable that she soon changed her mind and insisted they be freed.
03194	Even Captain Groleo was glad of that, now.
03195	There had been one small fire, easily extinguished:: against that,Balerion suddenly seemed to have far fewer rats than she’d had before, when she sailed under the nameSaduleon.
03196	And her crew, once as fearful as they were curious, had begun to take a queer fierce pride in “their” dragons.
03197	Every man of them, from captain to cook’s boy, loved to watch the three fly.
03198	though none so much as Dany.
03199	They are my children, she told herself,and if the maegispoke truly, they are the only children I am ever like to have.
03200	Viserion’s scales were the color of fresh cream, his horns, wing bones, and spinal crest a dark gold that flashed bright as metal in the sun.
03201	Rhaegal was made of the green of summer and the bronze of fall.
03202	They soared above the ships in wide circles, higher and higher, each trying to climb above the other.
03203	Dragons always preferred to attack from above, Dany had learned.
03204	Should either get between the other and the sun, he would fold his wings and dive screaming, and they would tumble from the sky locked together in a tangled scaly ball, jaws snapping and tails lashing.
03205	The first time they had done it, she feared that they meant to kill each other, but it was only sport.
03206	No sooner would they splash into the sea than they would break apart and rise again, shrieking and hissing, the salt water steaming off them as their wings clawed at the air.
03207	Drogon was aloft as well, though not in sight:: he would be miles ahead, or miles behind, hunting.
03208	He was always hungry, her Drogon.
03209	Hungry and growing fast.
03210	Another year, or perhaps two, and he may be large enough to ride.
03211	Then I shall have no need of ships to cross the great salt sea.
03212	But that time was not yet come.
03213	Rhaegal and Viserion were the size of small dogs, Drogon only a little larger, and any dog would have outweighed them:: they were all wings and neck and tail, lighter than they looked.
03214	And so Daenerys Targaryen must rely on wood and wind and canvas to bear her home.
03215	The wood and the canvas had served her well enough so far, but the fickle wind had turned traitor.
03216	For six days and six nights they had been becalmed, and now a seventh day had come, and still no breath of air to fill their sails.
03217	Fortunately, two of the ships that Magister Illyrio had sent after her were trading galleys, with two hundred oars apiece and crews of strong-armed oarsmen to row them.
03218	But the great cogBalerion was a song of a different key:: a ponderous broad-beamed sow of a ship with immense holds and huge sails, but helpless in a calm.
03219	Vhagar andMeraxes had let out lines to tow her, but it made for painfully slow going.
03220	All three ships were crowded, and heavily laden.
03221	“I cannot see Drogon,” said Ser Jorah Mormont as he joined her on the forecastle.
03222	“Is he lost again?” “We are the ones who are lost, ser.
03223	Drogon has no taste for this wet creeping, no more than I do.
03224	” Bolder than the other two, her black dragon had been the first to try his wings above the water, the first Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.

03227	html to flutter from ship to ship, the first to lose himself in a passing cloud.
03228	and the first to kill.
03229	The flying fish no sooner broke the surface of the water than they were enveloped in a lance of flame, snatched up, and swallowed.
03230	“How big will he grow?” Dany asked curiously.
03231	“Do you know?” “In the Seven Kingdoms, there are tales of dragons who grew so huge that they could pluck giant krakens from the seas.
03232	” Dany laughed.
03233	“That would be a wondrous sight to see.
03234	” “It is only a tale,Khaleesi ,” said her exile knight.
03235	“They talk of wise old dragons living a thousand years as well.
03236	” “Well, how longdoes a dragon live?” She looked up as Viserion swooped low over the ship, his wings beating slowly and stirring the limp sails.
03237	Ser Jorah shrugged.
03238	“A dragon’s natural span of days is many times as long as a man’s, or so the songs would have us believe.
03239	but the dragons the Seven Kingdoms knew best were those of House Targaryen.
03240	They were bred for war, and in war they died.
03241	It is no easy thing to slay a dragon, but it can be done.
03242	” The squire Whitebeard, standing by the figurehead with one lean hand curled about his tall hardwood staff, turned toward them and said, “Balerion the Black Dread was two hundred years old when he died during the reign of Jaehaerys the Conciliator.
03243	He was so large he could swallow an aurochs whole.
03244	A dragon never stops growing, Your Grace, so long as he has food and freedom.
03245	” His name was Arstan, but Strong Belwas had named him Whitebeard for his pale whiskers, and most everyone called him that now.
03246	He was taller than Ser Jorah, though not so muscular:: his eyes were a pale blue, his long beard as white as snow and as flne as silk.
03247	“Freedom?” asked Dany, curious.
03248	“What do you mean?” “In King’s Landing, your ancestors raised an immense domed castle for their dragons.
03249	The Dragonpit, it is called.
03250	It still stands atop the Hill of Rhaenys, though all in ruins now.
03251	That was where the royal dragons dwelt in days of yore, and a cavernous dwelling it was, with iron doors so wide that thirty knights could ride through them abreast.
03252	Yet even so, it was noted that none of the pit dragons ever reached the size of their ancestors.
03253	The maesters say it was because of the walls around them, and the great dome above their heads.
03254	” “If walls could keep us small, peasants would all be tiny and kings as large as giants,” said Ser Jorah.
03255	“I’ve seen huge men born in hovels, and dwarfs who dwelt in castles.
03256	” “Men are men,” Whitebeard replied.
03257	“Dragons are dragons.
03258	” Ser Jorah snorted his disdain.
03259	“How profound.
03260	” The exile knight had no love for the old man, he’d made that plain from the first.
03261	“What do you know of dragons, anyway?” “Little enough, that’s true.
03262	Yet I served for a time in King’s Landing in the days when King Aerys sat the Iron Throne, and walked beneath the dragonskulls that looked down from the walls of his throne room.
03263	” “Viserys talked of those skulls,” said Dany.
03264	“The Usurper took them down and hid them away.
03265	He could not bear them looking down on him upon his stolen throne.
03266	” She beckoned Whitebeard closer.
03267	“Did you ever meet my royal father?” King Aerys II had died before his daughter was born.

03271	html “I had that great honor, Your Grace.
03272	” “Did you find him good and gentle?” Whitebeard did his best to hide his feelings, but they were there, plain on his face.
03273	“His Grace was.
03274	often pleasant.
03275	” “Often?” Dany smiled.
03276	“But not always?” “He could be very harsh to those he thought his enemies.
03277	” “A wise man never makes an enemy of a king,” said Dany.
03278	“Did you know my brother Rhaegar as well?” “It was said that no man ever knew Prince Rhaegar, truly.
03279	I had the privilege of seeing him in tourney, though, and often heard him play his harp with its silver strings.
03280	” Ser Jorah snorted.
03281	“Along with a thousand others at some harvest feast.
03282	Next you’ll claim you squired for him.
03283	” “I make no such claim, ser.
03284	Myles Mooton was Prince Rhaegar’s squire, and Richard Lonmouth after him.
03285	When they won their spurs, he knighted them himself, and they remained his close companions.
03286	Young Lord Connington was dear to the prince as well, but his oldest friend was Arthur Dayne.
03287	” “The Sword of the Morning!” said Dany, delighted.
03288	“Viserys used to talk about his wondrous white blade.
03289	He said Ser Arthur was the only knight in the realm who was our brother’s peer.
03290	” Whitebeard bowed his head.
03291	“It is not my place to question the words of Prince Viserys.
03292	” “King,” Dany corrected.
03293	“He was a king, though he never reigned.
03294	Viserys, the Third of His Name.
03295	But what do you mean?” His answer had not been one that she’d expected.
03296	“Ser Jorah named Rhaegar the last dragon once.
03297	He had to have been a peerless warrior to be called that, surely?” “Your Grace,” said Whitebeard, “the Prince of Dragonstone was a most puissant warrior, but.
03298	” “Go on,” she urged.
03299	“You may speak freely to me.
03300	” “As you command.
03301	” The old man leaned upon his hardwood staff, his brow furrowed.
03302	“A warrior without peer.
03303	those are fine words, Your Grace, but words win no battles.
03304	” “Swords win battles,” Ser Jorah said bluntly.
03305	“And Prince Rhaegar knew how to use one.
03306	” “He did, ser, but.
03307	I have seen a hundred tournaments and more wars than I would wish, and however strong or fast or skilled a knight may be, there are others who can match him.
03308	A man will win one tourney, and fall quickly in the next.
03309	A slick spot in the grass may mean defeat, or what you ate for supper the night before.
03310	A change in the wind may bring the gift of victory.
03311	” He glanced at Ser Jorah.

03318	html Arstan had seen Ser Jorah fight at Lannisport, Dany knew, in the tourney Mormont had won with a lady’s favor knotted round his arm.
03319	He had won the lady too:: Lynesse of House Hightower, his second wife, highborn and beautiful.
03320	but she had ruined him, and abandoned him, and the memory of her was bitter to him now.
03321	“Be gentle, my knight.
03322	” She put a hand on Jorah’s arm.
03323	“Arstan had no wish to give offense, I’m certain.
03324	” “As you say,Khaleesi.
03325	” Ser Jorah’s voice was grudging.
03326	Dany turned back to the squire.
03327	“I know little of Rhaegar.
03328	Only the tales Viserys told, and he was a little boy when our brother died.
03329	What was he truly like?” The old man considered a moment.
03330	“Able.
03331	That above all.
03332	Determined, deliberate, dutiful, single-minded.
03333	There is a tale told of him.
03334	but doubtless Ser Jorah knows it as well.
03335	” “I would hear it from you.
03336	” “As you wish,” said Whitebeard.
03337	“As a young boy, the Prince of Dragonstone was bookish to a fault.
03338	He was reading so early that men said Queen Rhaella must have swallowed some books and a candle whilst he was in her womb.
03339	Rhaegar took no interest in the play of other children.
03340	The maesters were awed by his wits, but his father’s knights would jest sourly that Baelor the Blessed had been born again.
03341	Until one day Prince Rhaegar found something in his scrolls that changed him.
03342	No one knows what it might have been, only that the boy suddenly appeared early one morning in the yard as the knights were donning their steel.
03343	He walked up to Ser Willem Darry, the master-at-arms, and said, ‘I will require sword and armor.
03344	It seems I must be a warrior.
03345	’ ” “And he was!” said Dany, delighted.
03346	“He was indeed.
03347	” Whitebeard bowed.
03348	“My pardons, Your Grace.
03349	We speak of warriors, and I see that Strong Belwas has arisen.
03350	I must attend him.
03351	” Dany glanced aft.
03352	The eunuch was climbing through the hold amidships, nimble for all his size.
03353	Belwas was squat but broad, a good fifteen stone of fat and muscle, his great brown gut crisscrossed by faded white scars.
03354	He wore baggy pants, a yellow silk bellyband, and an absurdly tiny leather vest dotted with iron studs.
03355	“Strong Belwas is hungry!” he roared at everyone and no one in particular.
03356	“Strong Belwas will eat now!” Turning, he spied Arstan on the forecastle.
03357	“Whitebeard! You will bring food for Strong Belwas!” “You may go,” Dany told the squire.
03358	He bowed again, and moved off to tend the needs of the man he served.
03359	Ser Jorah watched with a frown on his blunt honest face.
03360	Mormont was big and burly, strong of jaw and thick of shoulder.
03361	Not a handsome man by any means, but as true a friend as Dany had ever known.
03362	“You would be wise to take that old man’s words well salted,” he told her when Whitebeard was out of earshot.
03363	“A queen must listen to all,” she reminded him.
03364	“The highborn and the low, the strong and the weak, the noble and the venal.
03365	One voice may speak you false, but in many there is always truth to be found.
03366	” She had read that in a book.
03367	“Hear my voice then, Your Grace,” the exile said.
03368	“This Arstan Whitebeard is playing you false.
03369	He is too old to be a squire, and too well spoken to be serving that oaf of a eunuch.

03373	html That does seem queer, Dany had to admit.
03374	Strong Belwas was an ex-slave, bred and trained in the fighting pits of Meereen.
03375	Magister Illyrio had sent him to guard her, or so Belwas claimed, and it was true that she needed guarding.
03376	The Usurper on his Iron Throne had offered land and lordship to any man who killed her.
03377	One attempt had been made already, with a cup of poisoned wine.
03378	The closer she came to Westeros, the more likely another attack became.
03379	Back in Qarth, the warlock Pyat Pree had sent a Sorrowful Man after her to avenge the Undying she’d burned in their House of Dust.
03380	Warlocks never forgot a wrong, it was said, and the Sorrowful Men never failed to kill.
03381	Most of the Dothraki would be against her as well.
03382	Khal Drogo’sko s ledkhalasar s of their own now, and none of them would hesitate to attack her own little band on sight, to slay and slave her people and drag Dany herself back to Vaes Dothrak to take her proper place among the withered crones of thedosh khaleen.
03383	Shehoped that Xaro Xhoan Daxos was not an enemy, but the Qartheen merchant had coveted her dragons.
03384	And there was Quaithe of the Shadow, that strange woman in the red lacquer mask with all her cryptic counsel.
03385	Was she an enemy too, or only a dangerous friend? Dany could not say.
03386	Ser Jorah saved me from the poisoner, and Arstan Whitebeard from the manticore.
03387	Perhaps Strong Belwas will save me from the next.
03388	He was huge enough, with arms like small trees and a great curvedarakh so sharp he might have shaved with it, in the unlikely event of hair sprouting on those smooth brown cheeks.
03389	Yet he was childlike as well.
03390	As a protector, he leaves much to be desired.
03391	Thankfully, I have Ser Jorah and my bloodriders.
03392	And my dragons, never forget.
03393	In time, the dragons would be her most formidable guardians, just as they had been for Aegon the Conqueror and his sisters three hundred years ago.
03394	Just now, though, they brought her more danger than protection.
03395	In all the world there were but three living dragons, and those were hers:: they were a wonder, and a terror, and beyond price.
03396	She was pondering her next words when she felt a cool breath on the back of her neck, and a loose strand of her silver-gold hair stirred against her brow.
03397	Above, the canvas creaked and moved, and suddenly a great cry went up from all overBalerion.
03398	“Wind!” the sailors shouted.
03399	“The wind returns, the wind! ” Dany looked up to where the great cog’s sails rippled and belled as the lines thrummed and tightened and sang the sweet song they had missed so for six long days.
03400	Captain Groleo rushed aft, shouting commands.
03401	The Pentoshi were scrambling up the masts, those that were not cheering.
03402	Even Strong Belwas let out a great bellow and did a little dance.
03403	“The gods are good!” Dany said.
03404	“You see, Jorah? We are on our way once more.
03405	” “Yes,” he said, “but to what, my queen?” All day the wind blew, steady from the east at first, and then in wild gusts.
03406	The sun set in a blaze of red.
03407	I am still half a world from Westeros , Dany reminded herself,but every hour brings me closer.
03408	She tried to imagine what it would feel like, when she first caught sight of the land she was born to rule.
03409	It will be as fair a shore as I have ever seen, I know it.
03410	How could it be otherwise? But later that night, asBalerion plunged onward through the dark and Dany sat crosslegged on her bunk in the captain’s cabin, feeding her dragons—“Even upon the sea,” Groleo had said, so graciously, “queens take precedence over captains”—a sharp knock came upon the door.
03411	Irri had been sleeping at the foot of her bunk (it was too narrow for three, and tonight was Jhiqui’s turn to share the soft featherbed with herkhaleesi ), but the handmaid roused at the knock and went to the door.
03412	Dany pulled up a coverlet and tucked it in under her arms.
03413	She was naked, and had not expected a caller at this hour.
03414	“Come,” she said when she saw Ser Jorah standing without, beneath a swaying Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.

03417	html lantern.
03418	The exile knight ducked his head as he entered.
03419	“Your Grace.
03420	I am sorry to disturb your sleep.
03421	” “I was not sleeping, ser.
03422	Come and watch.
03423	” She took a chunk of salt pork out of the bowl in her lap and held it up for her dragons to see.
03424	All three of them eyed it hungrily.
03425	Rhaegal spread green wings and stirred the air, and Viserion’s neck swayed back and forth like a long pale snake’s as he followed the movement of her hand.
03426	“Drogon,” Dany said softly, “dracarys.
03427	” And she tossed the pork in the air.
03428	Drogon moved quicker than a striking cobra.
03429	Flame roared from his mouth, orange and scarlet and black, searing the meat before it began to fall.
03430	As his sharp black teeth snapped shut around it, Rhaegal’s head darted close, as if to steal the prize from his brother’s jaws, but Drogon swallowed and screamed, and the smaller green dragon could onlyhiss in frustration.
03431	“Stop that, Rhaegal,” Dany said in annoyance, giving his head a swat.
03432	“You had the last one.
03433	I’ll have no greedy dragons.
03434	” She smiled at Ser Jorah.
03435	“I won’t need to char their meat over a brazier any longer.
03436	” “So I see.
03437	Dracarys ?” All three dragons turned their heads at the sound of that word and Viserion let loose with a blast of pale gold flame that made Ser Jorah take a hasty step backward.
03438	Dany giggled.
03439	“Be careful with that word, ser, or they’re like to singe your beard off.
03440	It means ‘dragonfire’ in High Valyrian.
03441	I wanted to choose a command that no one was like to utter by chance.
03442	” Mormont nodded.
03443	“Your Grace,” he said, “I wonder if I might have a few private words?” “Of course.
03444	Irri, leave us for a bit.
03445	” She put a hand on Jhiqui’s bare shoulder and shook the other handmaid awake.
03446	“You as well, sweetling.
03447	Ser Jorah needs to talk to me.
03448	” “Yes,Khaleesi.
03449	” Jhiqui tumbled from the bunk, naked and yawning, her thick black hair tumbled about her head.
03450	She dressed quickly and left with Irri, closing the door behind them.
03451	Dany gave the dragons the rest of the salt pork to squabble over, and patted the bed beside her.
03452	“Sit, goodser, and tell me what is troubling you.
03453	” “Three things.
03454	” Ser Jorah sat.
03455	“Strong Belwas.
03456	This Arstan Whitebeard.
03457	And Illyrio Mopatis, who sent them.
03458	” Again?Dany pulled the coverlet higher and tugged one end over her shoulder.
03459	“And why is that?” “The warlocks in Qarth told you that you would be betrayed three times,” the exile knight reminded her, as Viserion and Rhaegal began to snap and claw at each other.
03460	“Once for blood and once for gold and once for love.
03461	” Dany was not like to forget.
03462	“Mirri Maz Duur was the first.
03463	” “Which means two traitors yet remain.
03464	and now these two appear.
03465	I find that troubling, yes.
03466	Never forget, Robert offered a lordship to the man who slays you.
03467	” Dany leaned forward and yanked Viserion’s tail, to pull him off his green brother.
03468	Her blanket fell away from her chest as she moved.
03469	She grabbed it hastily and covered herself again.

03474	“But his son rules in his place.
03475	” Ser Jorah lifted his gaze, and his dark eyes met her own.
03476	“A dutiful son pays his father’s debts.
03477	Even blood debts.
03478	” “This boy Joffrey might want me dead.
03479	if he recalls that I’m alive.
03480	What has that to do with Belwas and Arstan Whitebeard? The old man does not even wear a sword.
03481	You’ve seen that.
03482	” “Aye.
03483	And I have seen how deftly he handles that staff of his.
03484	Recall how he killed that manticore in Qarth? It might as easily have been your throat he crushed.
03485	” “Might have been, but was not,” she pointed out.
03486	“It was a stinging manticore meant to slay me.
03487	He saved my life.
03488	” “Khaleesi, has it occurred to you that Whitebeard and Belwas might have been in league with the assassin? It might all have been a ploy to win your trust.
03489	” Her sudden laughter made Drogonhiss , and sent Viserion flapping to his perch above the porthole.
03490	“The ploy worked well.
03491	” The exile knight did not return her smile.
03492	“These are Illyrio’s ships, Illyrio’s captains, Illyrio’s sailors.
03493	and Strong Belwas and Arstan are his men as well, not yours.
03494	” “Magister Illyrio has protected me in the past.
03495	Strong Belwas says that he wept when he heard my brother was dead.
03496	” “Yes,” said Mormont, “but did he weep for Viserys, or for the plans he had made with him?” “His plans need not change.
03497	Magister Illyrio is a friend to House Targaryen, and wealthy.
03498	” “He was not born wealthy.
03499	In the world as I have seen it, no man grows rich by kindness.
03500	The warlocks said the second treason would be forgold.
03501	What does Illyrio Mopatis love more than gold?” “His skin.
03502	” Across the cabin Drogon stirred restlessly, steam rising from his snout.
03503	“Mirri Maz Duur betrayed me.
03504	I burned her for it.
03505	” “Mirri Maz Duur was in your power.
03506	In Pentos, you shall be in Illyrio’s power.
03507	It is not the same.
03508	I know the magister as well as you.
03509	He is a devious man, and clever—” “I need clever men about me if I am to win the Iron Throne.
03510	” Ser Jorah snorted.
03511	“That wineseller who tried to poison you was a clever man as well.
03512	Clever men hatch ambitious schemes.
03513	” Dany drew her legs up beneath the blanket.
03514	“You will protect me.
03515	You, and my bloodriders.
03516	” “Four men?Khaleesi , you believe you know Illyrio Mopatis, very well.
03517	Yet you insist on surrounding yourself with men you donot know, like this puffed-up eunuch and the world’s oldest squire.
03518	Take a lesson from Pyat Pree and Xaro Xhoan Daxos.
03519	” He means well, Dany reminded herself.
03520	He does all he does for love.

03525	Every man I take into my service is a risk, I understand that, but how am I to win the Seven Kingdoms without such risks? Am I to conquer Westeros with one exile knight and three Dothraki bloodriders?” His jaw set stubbornly.
03526	“Your path is dangerous, I will not deny that.
03527	But if you blindly trust in every liar and schemer who crosses it, you will end as your brothers did.
03528	” His obstinacy made her angry.
03529	He treats me like some child.
03530	“Strong Belwas could not scheme his way to breakfast.
03531	And what lies has Arstan Whitebeard told me?” “He is not what he pretends to be.
03532	He speaks to you more boldly than any squire would dare.
03533	” “He spoke frankly at my command.
03534	He knew my brother.
03535	” “A great many men knew your brother.
03536	Your Grace, in Westeros the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard sits on the small council, and serves the king with his wits as well as his steel.
03537	If I am the first of your Queensguard, I pray you, hear me out.
03538	I have a plan to put to you.
03539	” “What plan? Tell me.
03540	” “Illyrio Mopatis wants you back in Pentos, under his roof.
03541	Very well, go to him.
03542	but in your own time, and not alone.
03543	Let us see how loyal and obedient these new subjects of yours truly are.
03544	Command Groleo to change course for Slaver’s Bay.
03545	” Dany was not certain she liked the sound of that at all.
03546	Everything she’d ever heard of the flesh marts in the great slave cities of Yunkai, Meereen, and Astapor was dire and frightening.
03547	“What is there for me in Slaver’s Bay?” “An army,” said Ser Jorah.
03548	“If Strong Belwas is so much to your liking you can buy hundreds more like him out of the fighting pits of Meereen.
03549	but it is Astapor I’d set my sails for.
03550	In Astapor you can buy Unsullied.
03551	” “The slaves in the spiked bronze hats?” Dany had seen Unsullied guards in the Free Cities, posted at the gates of magisters, archons, and dynasts.
03552	“Why should I want Unsullied? They don’t even ride horses, and most of them are fat.
03553	” “The Unsullied you may have seen in Pentos and Myr were household guards.
03554	That’s soft service, and eunuchs tend to plumpness in any case.
03555	Food is the only vice allowed them.
03556	To judge all Unsullied by a few old household slaves is like judging all squires by Arstan Whitebeard, Your Grace.
03557	Do you know the tale of the Three Thousand of Qohor?” “No.
03558	” The coverlet slipped off Dany’s shoulder, and she tugged it back into place.
03559	“It was four hundred years ago or more, when the Dothraki first rode out of the east, sacking and burning every town and city in their path.
03560	Thekhal who led them was named Temmo.
03561	Hiskhalasar was not so big as Drogo’s, but it was big enough.
03562	Fifty thousand, at the least.
03563	Half of them braided warriors with bells ringing in their hair.
03564	“The Qohorik knew he was coming.
03565	They strengthened their walls, doubled the size of their own guard, and hired two free companies besides, the Bright Banners and the Second Sons.
03566	And almost as an afterthought, they sent a man to Astapor to buy three thousand Unsullied.
03567	It was a long march back to Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.

03569	com/abclit.
03570	html Qohor, however, and as they approached they saw the smoke and dust and heard the distant din of battle.
03571	“By the time the Unsullied reached the city the sun had set.
03572	Crows and wolves were feasting beneath the walls on what remained of the Qohorik heavy horse.
03573	The Bright Banners and Second Sons had fled, as sellswords are wont to do in the face of hopeless odds.
03574	With dark falling, the Dothraki had retired to their own camps to drink and dance and feast, but none doubted that they would return on the morrow to smash the city gates, storm the walls, and rape, loot, and slave as they pleased.
03575	“But when dawn broke and Temmo and his bloodriders led theirkhalasar out of camp, they found three thousand Unsullied drawn up before the gates with the Black Goat standard flying over their heads.
03576	So small a force could easily have been flanked, but you know Dothraki.
03577	These were men on foot, and men on foot are fit only to be ridden down.
03578	“The Dothraki charged.
03579	The Unsullied locked their shields, lowered their spears, and stood firm.
03580	Against twenty thousand screamers with bells in their hair, they stood firm.
03581	“Eighteen times the Dothraki charged, and broke themselves on those shields and spears like waves on a rocky shore.
03582	Thrice Temmo sent his archers wheeling past and arrows fell like rain upon the Three Thousand, but the Unsullied merely lifted their shields above their heads until the squall had passed.
03583	In the end only six hundred of them remained.
03584	but more than twelve thousand Dothraki lay dead upon that field, including Khal Temmo, his bloodriders, hisko s, and all his sons.
03585	On the morning of the fourth day, the newkhal led the survivors past the city gates in a stately procession.
03586	One by one, each man cut off his braid and threw it down before the feet of the Three Thousand.
03587	“Since that day, the city guard of Qohor has been made up solely of Unsullied, every one of whom carries a tall spear from which hangs a braid of human hair.
03588	“Thatis what you will find in Astapor, Your Grace.
03589	Put ashore there, and continue on to Pentos overland.
03590	It will take longer, yes.
03591	but when you break bread with Magister Illyrio, you will have a thousand swords behind you, not just four.
03592	” There is wisdom in this, yes, Dany thought,but.
03593	”How am I to buy a thousand slave soldiers? All I have of value is the crown the Tourmaline Brotherhood gave me.
03594	” “Dragons will be as great a wonder in Astapor as they were in Qarth.
03595	It may be that the slavers will shower you with gifts, as the Qartheen did.
03596	If not.
03597	these ships carry more than your Dothraki and their horses.
03598	They took on trade goods at Qarth, I’ve been through the holds and seen for myself.
03599	Bolts of silk and bales of tiger skin, amber and jade carvings, saffron, myrrh.
03600	slaves are cheap, Your Grace.
03601	Tiger skins are costly.
03602	” “Those areIllyrio’s tiger skins,” she objected.
03603	“And Illyrio is a friend to House Targaryen.
03604	” “All the more reason not to steal his goods.
03605	” “What use are wealthy friends if they will not put their wealth at your disposal, my queen? If Magister Illyrio would deny you, he is only Xaro Xhoan Daxos with four chins.
03606	And if he is sincere in his devotion to your cause, he will not begrudge you three shiploads of trade goods.
03607	What better use for his tiger skins than to buy you the beginnings of an army?” Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.

03610	html That’s true.
03611	Dany felt a rising excitement.
03612	“There will be dangers on such a long march.
03613	” “There are dangers at sea as well.
03614	Corsairs and pirates hunt the southern route, and north of Valyria theSmokingSea is demon-haunted.
03615	The next storm could sink or scatter us, a kraken could pull us under.
03616	or we might find ourselves becalmed again, and die of thirst as we wait for the wind to rise.
03617	A march will have different dangers, my queen, but none greater.
03618	” “What if Captain Groleo refuses to change course, though? And Arstan, Strong Belwas, what will they do?” Ser Jorah stood.
03619	“Perhaps it’s time you found that out.
03620	” “Yes,” she decided.
03621	“I’ll do it!” Dany threw back the coverlets and hopped from the bunk.
03622	“I’ll see the captain at once, command him to set course for Astapor.
03623	” She bent over her chest, threw open the lid, and seized the first garment to hand, a pair of loose sandsilk trousers.
03624	“Hand me my medallion belt,” she commanded Jorah as she pulled the sandsilk up over her hips.
03625	“And my vest—” she started to say, turning.
03626	Ser Jorah slid his arms around her.
03627	“Oh,” was all Dany had time to say as he pulled her close and pressed his lips down on hers.
03628	He smelled of sweat and salt and leather, and the iron studs on his jerkin dug into her naked breasts as he crushed her hard against him.
03629	One hand held her by the shoulder while the other slid down her spine to the small of her back, and her mouth opened for his tongue, though she never told it to.
03630	His beard is scratchy , she thought,but his mouth is sweet.
03631	The Dothraki wore no beards, only long mustaches, and only Khal Drogo had ever kissed her before.
03632	He should not be doing this.

03634	It was a long kiss, though how long Dany could not have said.

03640	I should have kissed you in the red waste, every night and every day.
03641	You were made to be kissed, often and well.
03642	” His eyes were on her breasts.
03643	Dany covered them with her hands, before her nipples could betray her.
03644	“I.

03646	I am your queen.

03657	And I tell you truly, Daenerys, there is no man in all the world who will ever be half so true to you as me.
03658	” Chapter Nine Bran The ridge slanted sharply from the earth, a long fold of stone and soil shaped like a claw.
03659	Trees clung to its lower slopes, pines and hawthorn and ash, but higher up the ground was bare, the ridgeline stark against the cloudy sky.
03660	He could feel the high stone calling him.
03661	Up he went, loping easy at first, then faster and higher, his strong legs eating up the incline.
03662	Birds burst from the branches overhead as he raced by, clawing and flapping their way into the sky.
03663	He could hear the wind sighing up amongst the leaves, the squirrels chittering to one another, even the sound a pinecone made as it tumbled to the forest floor.
03664	The smells were a song around him, a song that filled the good green world.
03665	Gravel flew from beneath his paws as he gained the last few feet to stand upon the crest.
03666	The sun hung above the tall pines huge and red, and below him the trees and hills went on and on as far as he could see or smell.
03667	A kite was circling far above, dark against the pink sky.
03668	Prince.
03669	The man-sound came into his head suddenly, yet he could feel the rightness of it.
03670	Prince of the green, prince of the wolfswood.
03671	He was strong and swift and fierce, and all that lived in the good green world went in fear of him.
03672	Far below, at the base of the woods, something moved amongst the trees.
03673	A flash of grey, quick-glimpsed and gone again, but it was enough to make his ears prick up.
03674	Down there beside a swift green brook, another form slipped by, running.
03675	Wolves , he knew.
03676	His little cousins, chasing down some prey.
03677	Now the prince could see more of them, shadows on fleet grey paws.
03678	A pack.
03679	He had a pack as well, once.
03680	Five they had been, and a sixth who stood aside.
03681	Somewhere down inside him were the sounds the men had given them to tell one from the other, but it was not by their sounds he knew them.
03682	He remembered their scents, his brothers and his sisters.
03683	They all had smelled alike, had smelled ofpack , but each was different too.
03684	His angry brother with the hot green eyes was near, the prince felt, though he had not seen him for many hunts.
03685	Yet with every sun that set he grew more distant, and he had been the last.
03686	The others were far scattered, like leaves blown by the wild wind.
03687	Sometimes he could sense them, though, as if they were still with him, only hidden from his sight by a boulder or a stand of trees.
03688	He could not smell them, nor hear their howls by night, yet he felt their presence at his back.
03689	all but the sister they had lost.
03690	His tail drooped when he remembered her.
03691	Four now, not five.
03692	Four and one more, the white who has no voice.
03693	These woods belonged to them, the snowy slopes and stony hills, the great green pines and the golden leaf oaks, the rushing streams and blue lakes fringed with fingers of white frost.
03694	But his sister had left the wilds, to walk in the halls of man-rock where other hunters ruled, and once within those halls it was hard to find the path back out.
03695	The wolf prince remembered.
03696	The wind shifted suddenly.
03697	Deer, and fear, and blood.
03698	The scent of prey woke the hunger in him.
03699	The prince sniffed the air again, Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.

03702	html turning, and then he was off, bounding along the ridgetop with jaws half-parted.
03703	The far side of the ridge was steeper than the one he’d come up, but he flew surefoot over stones and roots and rotting leaves, down the slope and through the trees, long strides eating up the ground.
03704	The scent pulled him onward, ever faster.
03705	The deer was down and dying when he reached her, ringed by eight of his small grey cousins.
03706	The heads of the pack had begun to feed, the male first and then his female, taking turns tearing flesh from the red underbelly of their prey.
03707	The others waited patiently, all but the tail, who paced in a wary circle a few strides from the rest, his own tail tucked low.
03708	He would eat the last of all, whatever his brothers left him.
03709	The prince was downwind, so they did not sense him until he leapt up upon a fallen log six strides from where they fed.
03710	The tail saw him first, gave a piteous whine, and slunk away.
03711	His pack brothers turned at the sound and bared their teeth, snarling, all but the head male and female.
03712	The direwolf answered the snarls with a low warning growl and showed them his own teeth.
03713	He was bigger than his cousins, twice the size of the scrawny tail, half again as large as the two pack heads.
03714	He leapt down into their midst, and three of them broke, melting away into the brush.
03715	Another came at him, teeth snapping.
03716	He met the attack head on, caught the wolf’s leg in his jaws when they met, and flung him aside yelping and limping.
03717	And then there was only the head wolf to face, the great grey male with his bloody muzzle fresh from the prey’s soft belly.
03718	There was white on his muzzle as well, to mark him as an old wolf, but when his mouth opened, red slaver ran from his teeth.
03719	He has no fear, the prince thought,no more than me.
03720	It would be a good fight.
03721	They went for each other.
03722	Long they fought, rolling together over roots and stones and fallen leaves and the scattered entrails of the prey, tearing at each other with tooth and claw, breaking apart, circling each round the other, and bolting in to fight again.
03723	The prince was larger, and much the stronger, but his cousin had a pack.
03724	The female prowled around them closely, snuffing and snarling, and would interpose herself whenever her mate broke off bloodied.
03725	From time to time the other wolves would dart in as well, to snap at a leg or an ear when the prince was turned the other way.
03726	One angered him so much that he whirled in a black fury and tore out the attacker’s throat.
03727	After that the others kept their distance.
03728	And as the last red light was filtering through green boughs and golden, the old wolf lay down weary in the dirt, and rolled over to expose his throat and belly.
03729	It was submission.
03730	The prince sniffed at him and licked the blood from fur and torn flesh.
03731	When the old wolf gave a soft whimper, the direwolf turned away.
03732	He was very hungry now, and the prey was his.
03733	“Hodor.
03734	” The sudden sound made him stop and snarl.
03735	The wolves regarded him with green and yellow eyes, bright with the last light of day.
03736	None of them had heard it.
03737	It was a queer wind that blew only in his ears.
03738	He buried his jaws in the deer’s belly and tore off a mouthful of flesh.
03739	“Hodor, hodor.
03740	” No, he thought.
03741	No, I won’t.
03742	It was a boy’s thought, not a direwolf’s.
03743	The woods were darkening all about him, until only the shadows of the trees remained, and the glow of his cousins’ eyes.

03747	html those and behind those eyes, he saw a big man’s grinning face, and a stone vault whose walls were spotted with niter.
03748	The rich warm taste of blood faded on his tongue.
03749	No, don’t, don’t, I want to eat, I want to, I want.
03750	“Hodor, hodor, hodor, hodor, hodor,” Hodor chanted as he shook him softly by the shoulders, back and forth and back and forth.
03751	He was trying to be gentle, he always tried, but Hodor was seven feet tall and stronger than he knew, and his huge hands rattled Bran’s teeth together.
03752	“NO!” he shouted angrily.
03753	“Hodor, leave off, I’m here, I’mhere.
03754	” Hodor stopped, looking abashed.
03755	“Hodor?” The woods and wolves were gone.
03756	Bran was back again, down in the damp vault of some ancient watchtower that must have been abandoned thousands of years before.
03757	It wasn’t much of a tower now.
03758	Even the tumbled stones were so overgrown with moss and ivy that you could hardly see them until you were right on top of them.
03759	“TumbledownTower”, Bran had named the place:: it was Meera who found the way down into the vault, however.
03760	“You were gone too long.
03761	” Jojen Reed was thirteen, only four years older than Bran.
03762	Jojen wasn’t much bigger either, no more than two inches or maybe three, but he had a solemn way of talking that made him seem older and wiser than he really was.
03763	At Winterfell, Old Nan had dubbed him “little grandfather.
03764	” Bran frowned at him.
03765	“I wanted to eat.
03766	” “Meera will be back soon with supper.
03767	” “I’m sick of frogs.
03768	” Meera was a frogeater from the Neck, so Bran couldn’t reallyblame her for catching so many frogs, he supposed, but even so.
03769	“I wanted to eat the deer.
03770	” For a moment he remembered the taste of it, the blood and the raw rich meat, and his mouth watered.
03771	I won the fight for it.
03772	I won.
03773	“Did you mark the trees?” Bran flushed.
03774	Jojen was always telling him to do things when he opened his third eye and put on Summer’s skin.
03775	To claw the bark of a tree, to catch a rabbit and bring it back in his jaws uneaten, to push some rocks in a line.
03776	Stupid things.
03777	“I forgot,” he said.
03778	“You always forget.
03779	” It was true.
03780	Hemeant to do the things that Jojen asked, but once he was a wolf they never seemed important.
03781	There were always things to see and things to smell, a whole green world to hunt.
03782	And he couldrun! There was nothing better than running, unless it was running after prey.
03783	“I was a prince, Jojen,” he told the older boy.
03784	“I was the prince of the woods.
03785	” “You are a prince,” Jojen reminded him softly.
03786	“You remember, don’t you? Tell me who you are.
03787	” “Youknow.
03788	” Jojen was his friend and his teacher, but sometimes Bran just wanted to hit him.
03789	“I want you to say the words.
03790	Tell me who you are.
03791	” “Bran,” he said sullenly.
03792	Bran the Broken.
03793	“Brandon Stark.
03794	”The cripple boy.
03795	“The Prince of Winterfell.

03801	How can you be the prince of someplace you might never see again? “And who is Summer?” Jojen prompted.
03802	“My direwolf.
03803	” He smiled.
03804	“Prince of the green.
03805	” “Bran the boy and Summer the wolf.
03806	You are two, then?” “Two,” he sighed, “and one.
03807	” He hated Jojen when he got stupid like this.
03808	At Winterfell he wanted me to dream my wolf dreams, and now that I know how he’s always calling me back.
03809	“Remember that, Bran.
03810	Rememberyourself , or the wolf will consume you.
03811	When you join, it is not enough to run and hunt and howl in Summer’s skin.
03812	” It is for me, Bran thought.
03813	He liked Summer’s skin better than his own.
03814	What good is it to be a skinchanger if you can’t wear the skin you like? “Will you remember? And next time, mark the tree.
03815	Any tree, it doesn’t matter, so long as you do it.
03816	” “I will.
03817	I’ll remember.
03818	I could go back and do it now, if you like.
03819	I won’t forget this time.
03820	”But I’ll eat my deer first, and fight with those little wolves some more.
03821	Jojen shook his head.
03822	“No.
03823	Best stay, and eat.
03824	With your own mouth.
03825	A warg cannot live on what his beast consumes.
03826	” How would you know?Bran thought resentfully.
03827	You’ve never been a warg, you don’t know what it’s like.
03828	Hodor jerked suddenly to his feet, almost hitting his head on the barrel-vaulted ceiling.
03829	“HODOR!” he shouted, rushing to the door.
03830	Meera pushed it open just before he reached it, and stepped through into their refuge.
03831	“Hodor, hodor,” the huge stableboy said, grinning.
03832	Meera Reed was sixteen, a woman grown, but she stood no higher than her brother.
03833	All the crannogmen were small, she told Bran once when he asked why she wasn’t taller.
03834	Brown-haired, green-eyed, and flat as a boy, she walked with a supple grace that Bran could only watch and envy.
03835	Meera wore a long sharp dagger, but her favorite way to fight was with a slender three-pronged frog spear in one hand and a woven net in the other.
03836	“Who’s hungry?” she asked, holding up her catch: two small silvery trout and six fat green frogs.
03837	“I am,” said Bran.
03838	But not for frogs.
03839	Back at Winterfell before all the bad things had happened, the Walders used to say that eating frogs would turn your teeth green and make moss grow under your arms.
03840	He wondered if the Walders were dead.
03841	He hadn’t seen their corpses at Winterfell.
03842	but there had been alot of corpses, and they hadn’t looked inside the buildings.
03843	“We’ll just have to feed you, then.
03844	Will you help me clean the catch, Bran?” He nodded.
03845	It was hard to sulk with Meera.
03846	She was much more cheerful than her brother, and always seemed to know how to make him smile.
03847	Nothing ever scared her or made her angry.
03848	Well, except Jojen, sometimes.
03849	Jojen Reed could scare most anyone.
03850	He dressed all in green, his eyes were Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.

03853	html murky as moss, and he had green dreams.
03854	What Jojen dreamed came true.
03855	Except he dreamed me dead, and I’m not.
03856	Only he was, in a way.
03857	Jojen sent Hodor out for wood and built them a small fire while Bran and Meera were cleaning the fish and frogs.
03858	They used Meera’s helm for a cooking pot, chopping up the catch into little cubes and tossing in some water and some wild onions Hodor had found to make a froggy stew.
03859	It wasn’t as good as deer, but it wasn’t bad either, Bran decided as he ate.
03860	“Thank you, Meera,” he said.
03861	“My lady.
03862	” “You are most welcome, Your Grace.
03863	” “Come the morrow,” Jojen announced, “we had best move on.
03864	” Bran could see Meera tense.
03865	“Have you had a green dream?” “No,” he admitted.
03866	“Why leave, then?” his sister demanded.
03867	“TumbledownTower’s a good place for us.
03868	No villages near, the woods are full of game, there’s fish and frogs in the streams and lakes.
03869	and who is ever going to find us here?” “This is not the place we are meant to be.
03870	” “It is safe, though.
03871	” “Itseems safe, I know,” said Jojen, “but for how long? There was a battle at Winterfell, we saw the dead.
03872	Battles mean wars.
03873	If some army should take us unawares.
03874	” “It might be Robb’s army,” said Bran.
03875	“Robb will come back from the south soon, I know he will.
03876	He’ll come back with all his banners and chase the ironmen away.
03877	” “Your maester said naught of Robb when he lay dying,” Jojen reminded him.
03878	“Ironmen on the Stony Shore, he said, and,east, the Bastard ofBolton.
03879	Moat Cailin and Deepwood Motte fallen, the heir to Cerwyn dead, and the castellan of Torrhen’s Square.
03880	War everywhere , he said,each man against his neighbor.
03881	” “We have plowed this field before,” his sister said.
03882	“You want to make for the Wall, and your three-eyed crow.
03883	That’s well and good, but the Wall is a very long way and Bran has no legs but Hodor.
03884	If we were mounted.
03885	” “If we were eagles we might fly,” said Jojen sharply, “but we have no wings, no more than we have horses.
03886	” “There are horses to be had,” said Meera.
03887	“Even in the deep of the wolfswood there are foresters, crofters, hunters.
03888	Some will have horses.
03889	” “And if they do, should we steal them? Are we thieves? The last thing we need is men hunting us.
03890	” “We could buy them,” she said.
03891	“Trade for them.
03892	” “Look at us, Meera.
03893	A crippled boy with a direwolf, a simpleminded giant, and two crannogmen a thousand leagues from the Neck.
03894	We will be known.
03895	And word will spread.

03899	html dead, he is safe.
03900	Alive, he becomes prey for those who want him dead for good and true.
03901	” Jojen went to the fire to prod the embers with a stick.
03902	“Somewhere to the north, the three-eyed crow awaits us.
03903	Bran has need of a teacher wiser than me.
03904	” “How, Jojen?” his sister asked.
03905	“How?” “Afoot,” he answered.
03906	“A step at a time.
03907	” “The road from Greywater to Winterfell went on forever, and we were mounted then.
03908	You want us to travel a longer road on foot, without even knowing where it ends.
03909	Beyond the Wall, you say.
03910	I haven’t been there, no more than you, but I know that Beyond the Wall’s a big place, Jojen.
03911	Are there many three-eyed crows, or only one? How do we find him?” “Perhaps he will find us.
03912	” Before Meera could find a reply to that, they heard the sound:: the distant howl of a wolf, drifting through the night.
03913	“Summer?” asked Jojen, listening.
03914	“No.
03915	” Bran knew the voice of his direwolf.
03916	“Are you certain?” said the little grandfather.
03917	“Certain.
03918	” Summer had wandered far afield today, and would not be back till dawn.
03919	Maybe Jojen dreams green, but he can’t tell a wolf from a direwolf.
03920	He wondered why they all listened to Jojen so much.
03921	He was not a prince like Bran, nor big and strong like Hodor, nor as good a hunter as Meera, yet somehow it was always Jojen telling them what to do.
03922	“We should steal horses like Meera wants,” Bran said, “and ride to the Umbers up at Last Hearth.
03923	” He thought a moment.
03924	“Or we could steal a boat and sail down the White Knife toWhiteHarbor town.
03925	That fat Lord Manderly rules there, he was friendly at the harvest feast.
03926	He wanted to build ships.
03927	Maybe he built some, and we could sail to Riverrun and bring Robb home with all his army.
03928	Then it wouldn’t matter who knew I was alive.
03929	Robb wouldn’t let anyone hurt us.
03930	” “Hodor!” burped Hodor.
03931	“Hodor, hodor.
03932	” He was the only one who liked Bran’s plan, though.
03933	Meera just smiled at him and Jojen frowned.
03934	They never listened to what he wanted, even though Bran was a Stark and a prince besides, and the Reeds of the Neck were Stark bannermen.
03935	“Hoooodor,” said Hodor, swaying.
03936	“Hooooooodor, hoooooodor, hoDOR, hoDOR, hoDOR.
03937	” Sometimes he liked to do this, just saying his name different ways, over and over and over.
03938	Other times, he would stay so quiet you forgot he was there.
03939	There was never any knowing with Hodor.
03940	“HODOR, HODOR, HODOR!” he shouted.
03941	He is not going to stop, Bran realized.
03942	“Hodor,” he said, “why don’t you go outside and train with your sword?” The stableboy had forgotten about his sword, but now he remembered.
03943	“Hodor!” he burped.
03944	He went for his blade.
03945	They had three tomb swords taken from the crypts of Winterfell where Bran and his brother Rickon had hidden from Theon Greyjoy’s ironmen.
03946	Bran claimed his uncle Brandon’s sword, Meera the one she found upon the knees of his grandfather Lord Rickard.
03947	Hodor’s blade was much older, a huge heavy piece of iron, dull from centuries of neglect and well spotted with rust.
03948	He could Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.

03952	There was a rotted tree near the tumbled stones that he had hacked half to pieces.
03953	Even when he went outside they could hear him through the walls, bellowing “HODOR!” as he cut and slashed at his tree.
03954	Thankfully the wolfswood was huge, and there was not like to be anyone else around to hear.
03955	“Jojen, what did you mean about a teacher?” Bran asked.
03956	“You’remy teacher.
03957	I know I never marked the tree, but I will the next time.
03958	My third eye is open like you wanted.
03959	” “So wide open that I fear you may fall through it, and live all the rest of your days as a wolf of the woods.
03960	” “I won’t, I promise.
03961	” “The boy promises.
03962	Will the wolf remember? You run with Summer, you hunt with him, kill with him.
03963	but you bend to his will more than him to yours.
03964	” “I just forget,” Bran complained.
03965	“I’m only nine.
03966	I’ll be better when I’m older.
03967	Even Florian the Fool and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight weren’t great knights when they werenine.
03968	” “That is true,” said Jojen, “and a wise thing to say, if the days were still growing longer.
03969	but they aren’t.
03970	You are a summer child, I know.
03971	Tell me the words of House Stark.

03973	” Just saying it made Bran feel cold.
03974	Jojen gave a solemn nod.
03975	“I dreamed of a winged wolf bound to earth by chains of stone, and came to Winterfell to free him.
03976	The chains are off you now, yet still you do not fly.
03977	” “Thenyou teach me.
03978	” Bran still feared the three-eyed crow who haunted his dreams sometimes, pecking endlessly at the skin between his eyes and telling him to fly.
03979	“You’re a greenseer.
03980	” “No,” said Jojen, “only a boy who dreams.
03981	The greenseers were more than that.
03982	They were wargs as well, asyou are, and the greatest of them could wear the skins ofany beast that flies or swims or crawls, and could look through the eyes of the weirwoods as well, and see the truth that lies beneath the world.
03983	“The gods give many gifts, Bran.
03984	My sister is a hunter.
03985	It is given to her to run swiftly, and stand so still she seems to vanish.
03986	She has sharp ears, keen eyes, a steady hand with net and spear.
03987	She can breathe mud and fly through trees.
03988	I could not do these things, no more than you could.
03989	To me the gods gave the green dreams, and to you.
03990	you could be more than me, Bran.
03991	You are the winged wolf, and there is no saying how far and high you might fly.
03992	if you had someone to teach you.
03993	How can I help you master a gift I do not understand? We remember the First Men in the Neck, and the children of the forest who were their friends.
03994	but so much is forgotten, and so much we never knew.
03995	” Meera took Bran by the hand.
03996	“If we stay here, troubling no one, you’ll be safe until the war ends.
03997	You will not learn, though, except what my brother can teach you, and you’ve heard what he says.
03998	If we leave this place to seek refuge at Last Hearth or beyond the Wall, we risk being taken.
03999	You are only a boy, I know, but you are our prince as well, our lord’s son and our king’s true heir.
04000	We have sworn you our faith by earth and water, bronze and iron, ice and fire.
04001	The risk is yours, Bran, as is the gift.
04002	The choice should be yours too, I think.
04003	We are your servants to command.
04004	” She grinned.
04005	“At least in this.

04009	html “You mean,” Bran said, “you’ll do whatI say? Truly?” “Truly, my prince,” the girl replied, “so consider well.
04010	” Bran tried to think it through, the way his father might have.
04011	The Greatjon’s uncles Hother Whoresbane and Mors Crowfood were fierce men, but he thought they would be loyal.
04012	And the Karstarks, them too.
04013	Karhold was a strong castle, Father always said.
04014	We would be safe with the Umbers or the Karstarks.
04015	Or they could go south to fat Lord Manderly.
04016	At Winterfell, he’d laughed a lot, and never seemed to look at Bran with so much pity as the other lords.
04017	Castle Cerwyn was closer thanWhiteHarbor , but Maester Luwin had said that Cley Cerwyn was dead.
04018	The Umbers and the Karstarks and the Manderlys may all be dead as well , he realized.
04019	As he would be, if he was caught by the ironmen or the Bastard of Bolton.
04020	If they stayed here, hidden down beneathTumbledownTower , no one would find them.
04021	He would stay alive.
04022	And crippled.
04023	Bran realized he was crying.
04024	Stupid baby , he thought at himself.
04025	No matter where he went, to Karhold orWhiteHarbor or Greywater Watch, he’d be a cripple when he got there.
04026	He balled his hands into fists.
04027	“I want to fly,” he told them.
04028	“Please.
04029	Take me to the crow.
04030	” Chapter Ten Davos When he came up on deck, the long point of Driftmark was dwindling behind them while Dragonstone rose from the sea ahead.
04031	A pale grey wisp of smoke blew from the top of the mountain to mark where the island lay.
04032	Dragonmont is restless this morning , Davos thought,or else Melisandre is burning someone else.
04033	Melisandre had been much in his thoughts asShayala’s Dance made her way acrossBlackwaterBay and through the Gullet, tacking against perverse contrary winds.
04034	The great fire that burned atop the Sharp Point watchtower at the end of Massey’s Hook reminded him of the ruby she wore at her throat, and when the world turned red at dawn and sunset the drifting clouds turned the same color as the silks and satins of her rustling gowns.
04035	She would be waiting on Dragonstone as well, waiting in all her beauty and all her power, with her god and her shadows and his king.
04036	The red priestess had always seemed loyal to Stannis, until now.
04037	She has broken him, as a man breaks a horse.
04038	She would ride him to power if she could, and for that she gave my sons to the fire.
04039	I will cut the living heart from her breast and see how it burns.
04040	He touched the hilt of the fine long Lysene dirk that the captain had given him.
04041	The captain had been very kind to him.
04042	His name was Khorane Sathmantes, a Lyseni like Salladhor Saan, whose ship this was.
04043	He had the pale blue eyes you often saw onLys , set in a bony weatherworn face, but he had spent many years trading in the Seven Kingdoms.
04044	When he learned that the man he had plucked from the sea was the celebrated onion knight, he gave him the use of his own cabin and his own clothes, and a pair of new boots that almost fit.
04045	He insisted that Davos share his provisions as well, though that turned out badly.
04046	His stomach could not tolerate the snails and lampreys and other rich food Captain Khorane so relished, and after his first meal at the captain’s table he spent the rest of the day with one end or the other dangling over the rail.

04050	html Dragonstone loomed larger with every stroke of the oars.
04051	Davos could see the shape of the mountain now, and on its side the great black citadel with its gargoyles and dragon towers.
04052	The bronze figurehead at the bow ofShayala’s Dance sent up wings of salt spray as it cut the waves.
04053	He leaned his weight against the rail, grateful for its support.
04054	His ordeal had weakened him.
04055	If he stood too long his legs shook, and sometimes he fell prey to uncontrollable fits of coughing and brought up gobs of bloody phlegm.
04056	It is nothing , he told himself.
04057	Surely the gods did not bring me safe through flre and sea only to kill me with a flux.
04058	As he listened to the pounding of the oarmaster’s drum, the thrum of the sail, and the rhythmic swish and creak of the oars, he thought back to his younger days, when these same sounds woke dread in his heart on many a misty morn.
04059	They heralded the approach of old Ser Tristimun’s sea watch, and the sea watch was death to smugglers when Aerys Targaryen sat the Iron Throne.
04060	But that was another lifetime, he thought.
04061	That was before the onion ship, before Storm’s End, before Stannis shortened my fingers.
04062	That was before the war or the red comet, before I was a Seaworth or a knight.
04063	I was a different man in those days, before Lord Stannis raised me high.
04064	Captain Khorane had told him of the end of Stannis’s hopes, on the night the river burned.
04065	The Lannisters had taken him from the flank, and his fickle bannermen had abandoned him by the hundreds in the hour of his greatest need.
04066	“King Renly’s shade was seen as well,” the captain said, “slaying right and left as he led the lion lord’s van.
04067	It’s said his green armor took a ghostly glow from the wildfire, and his antlers ran with golden flames.
04068	” Renly’s shade.
04069	Davos wondered if his sons would return as shades as well.
04070	He had seen too many queer things on the sea to say that ghosts did not exist.
04071	“Did none keep faith?” he asked.
04072	“Some few,” the captain said.
04073	“The queen’s kin, them in chief.
04074	We took off many who wore the fox-and-flowers, though many more were left ashore, with all manner of badges.
04075	Lord Florent is the King’s Hand on Dragonstone now.
04076	” The mountain grew taller, crowned all in pale smoke.
04077	The sail sang, the drum beat, the oars pulled smoothly, and before very long the mouth of the harbor opened before them.
04078	So empty , Davos thought, remembering how it had been before, with the ships crowding every quay and rocking at anchor off the breakwater.
04079	He could see Salladhor Saan’s flagshipValyrian moored at the quay whereFury and her sisters had once tied up.
04080	The ships on either side of her had striped Lysene hulls as well.
04081	In vain he looked for any sign ofLady Marya orWraith.
04082	They pulled down the sail as they entered the harbor, to dock on oars alone.
04083	The captain came to Davos as they were tying up.
04084	“My prince will wish to see you at once.
04085	” A fit of coughing seized Davos as he tried to answer.
04086	He clutched the rail for support and spat over the side.
04087	“The king,” he wheezed.
04088	“I must go to the king.
04089	”For where the king is, I will find Melisandre.
04090	“No one goes to the king,” Khorane Sathmantes replied firmly.
04091	“Salladhor Saan will tell you.
04092	Him first.
04093	” Davos was too weak to defy him.
04094	He could only nod.
04095	Salladhor Saan was not aboard hisValyrian.
04096	They found him at another quay a quarter mile distant, down in the hold of a big-bellied Pentoshi cog namedBountiful Harvest , counting cargo with two eunuchs.
04097	One held a lantern, the other a wax tablet and stylus.
04098	“Thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-nine,” the old rogue was saying when Davos and the captain came down the hatch.
04099	Today he wore a wine-colored Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.

04102	html tunic and high boots of bleached white leather inlaid with silver scrollwork.
04103	Pulling the stopper from a jar, he sniffed, sneezed, and said, “A coarse grind, and of the second quality, my nose declares.
04104	The bill of lading is saying forty-three jars.
04105	Where have the others gotten to, I am wondering? These Pentoshi, do they think I am not counting?” When he saw Davos he stopped suddenly.
04106	“Is it pepper stinging my eyes, or tears? Is this the knight of the onions who stands before me? No, how can it be, my dear friend Davos died on the burning river, all agree.
04107	Why has he come to haunt me?” “I am no ghost, Salla.
04108	” “What else? My onion knight was never so thin or so pale as you.
04109	” Salladhor Saan threaded his way between the jars of spice and bolts of cloth that filled the hold of the merchanter, wrapped Davos in a fierce embrace, then kissed him once on each cheek and a third time on his forehead.
04110	“You are still warm, ser, and I feel your heart thumpety-thumping.
04111	Can it be true? The sea that swallowed you has spit you up again.
04112	” Davos was reminded of Patchface, Princess Shireen’s lackwit fool.
04113	He had gone into the sea as well, and when he came out he was mad.
04114	Am I mad as well? He coughed into a gloved hand and said, “I swam beneath the chain and washed ashore on a spear of the merling king.
04115	I would have died there, if Shayala’s Dance had not come upon me.
04116	” Salladhor Saan threw an arm around the captain’s shoulders.
04117	“This was well done, Khorane.
04118	You will be having a fine reward, I am thinking.
04119	Meizo Mahr, be a good eunuch and take my friend Davos to the owner’s cabin.
04120	Fetch him some hot wine with cloves, I am misliking the sound of that cough.
04121	Squeeze some lime in it as well.
04122	And bring white cheese and a bowl of those cracked green olives we counted earlier! Davos, I will join you soon, once I have bespoken our good captain.
04123	You will be forgiving me, I know.
04124	Do not eat all the olives, or I must be cross with you!” Davos let the elder of the two eunuchs escort him to a large and lavishly furnished cabin at the stem of the ship.
04125	The carpets were deep, the windows stained glass, and any of the great leather chairs would have seated three of Davos quite comfortably.
04126	The cheese and olives arrived shortly, and a cup of steaming hot red wine.
04127	He held it between his hands and sipped it gratefully.
04128	The warmth felt soothing as it spread through his chest.
04129	Salladhor Saan appeared not long after.
04130	“You must be forgiving me for the wine, my friend.
04131	These Pentoshi would drink their own water if it were purple.
04132	” “It will help my chest,” said Davos.
04133	“Hot wine is better than a compress, my mother used to say.
04134	” “You shall be needing compresses as well, I am thinking.
04135	Sitting on a spear all this long time, oh my.
04136	How are you finding that excellent chair? He has fat cheeks, does he not?” “Who?” asked Davos, between sips of hot wine.
04137	“Illyrio Mopatis.
04138	A whale with whiskers, I am telling you truly.
04139	These chairs were built to his measure, though he is seldom bestirring himself from Pentos to sit in them.
04140	A fat man always sits comfortably, I am thinking, for he takes his pillow with him wherever he goes.
04141	” “How is it you come by a Pentoshi ship?” asked Davos.
04142	“Have you gone pirate again, my lord?” He set his empty cup aside.
04143	“Vile calumny.
04144	Who has suffered more from pirates than Salladhor Saan? I ask only what is due me.

04148	html Much gold is owed, oh yes, but I am not without reason, so in place of coin I have taken a handsome parchment, very crisp.
04149	It bears the name and seal of Lord Alester Florent, the Hand of the King.
04150	I am made Lord of Blackwater Bay, and no vessel may be crossing my lordly waters without my lordly leave, no.
04151	And when these outlaws are trying to steal past me in the night to avoid my lawful duties and customs, why, they are no better than smugglers, so I am well within my rights to seize them.
04152	” The old pirate laughed.
04153	“I cut off no man’s fingers, though.
04154	What good are bits of fingers? The ships I am taking, the cargoes, a few ransoms, nothing unreasonable.
04155	” He gave Davos a sharp look.
04156	“You are unwell, my friend.
04157	That cough.
04158	and so thin, I am seeing your bones through your skin.
04159	And yet I am not seeing your little bag of fingerbones.
04160	” Old habit made Davos reach for the leather pouch that was no longer there.
04161	“I lost it in the river.
04162	”My luck.
04163	“The river was terrible,” Salladhor Saan said solemnly.
04164	“Even from the bay, I was seeing, and shuddering.
04165	” Davos coughed, spat, and coughed again.
04166	“I sawBlack Betha burning, andFury as well,” he finally managed, hoarsely.
04167	“Did none of our ships escape the fire?” Part of him still hoped.
04168	“Lord Steffon, Ragged Jenna, Swift Sword, Laughing Lord, and some others were upstream of the pyromancers’pissing, yes.
04169	They did not burn, but with the chain raised, neither could they be flying.
04170	Some few were surrendering.
04171	Most rowed far up the Blackwater, away from the battling, and then were sunk by their crews so they would not be falling into Lannister hands.
04172	Ragged Jenna andLaughing Lord are still playing pirate on the river, I have heard, but who can say if it is so?” “Lady Marya?” Davos asked.
04173	“Wraith?” Salladhor Saan put a hand on Davos’s forearm and gave a squeeze.
04174	“No.
04175	Of them, no.
04176	I am sorry, my friend.
04177	They were good men, your Dale and Allard.
04178	But this comfort I can give you—your young Devan was among those we took off at the end.
04179	The brave boy never once left the king’s side, or so they say.
04180	” For a moment he felt almost dizzy, his relief was so palpable.
04181	He had been afraid to ask about Devan.
04182	“The Mother is merciful.
04183	I must go to him, Salla.
04184	I must see him.
04185	” “Yes,” said Salladhor Saan.
04186	“And you will be wanting to sail toCape Wrath , I know, to see your wife and your two little ones.
04187	You must be having a new ship, I am thinking.
04188	” “His Grace will give me a ship,” said Davos.
04189	The Lyseni shook his head.
04190	“Of ships, His Grace has none, and Salladhor Saan has many.
04191	The king’s ships burned up on the river, but not mine.
04192	You shall have one, old friend.
04193	You will sail for me, yes? You will dance into Braavos and Myr and Volantis in the black of night, all unseen, and dance out again with silks and spices.
04194	We will be having fat purses, yes.
04195	” “You are kind, Salla, but my duty’s to my king, not your purse.
04196	The war will go on.
04197	Stannis is still the rightful heir by all the laws of the Seven Kingdoms.
04198	” “All the laws are not helping when all the ships burn up, I am thinking.
04199	And your king, well, you will be finding him changed, I am fearing.
04200	Since the battle, he sees no one, but broods in his Stone Drum.
04201	Queen Selyse keeps court for him with her uncle the Lord Alester, who is naming himself the Hand.

04207	There is no gold, not even a little bit to pay faithful Salladhor Saan what is owed him, and only those knights that we took off at the end, and no ships but my little brave few.
04208	” A sudden racking cough bent Davos over.
04209	Salladhor Saan moved to help him, but he waved him off, and after a moment he recovered.
04210	“No one?” he wheezed.
04211	“What do you mean, he sees no one?” His voice sounded wet and thick, even in his own ears, and for a moment the cabin swam dizzily around him.
04212	“No one buther ,” said Salladhor Saan, and Davos did not have to ask who he meant.
04213	“My friend, you tire yourself.
04214	It is a bed you are needing, not Salladhor Saan.
04215	A bed and many blankets, with a hot compress for your chest and more wine and cloves.
04216	” Davos shook his head.
04217	“I will be fine.
04218	Tell me, Salla, I must know.
04219	No one but Melisandre?” The Lyseni gave him a long doubtful look, and continued reluctantly.
04220	“The guards keep all others away, even his queen and his little daughter.
04221	Servants bring meals that no one eats.
04222	” He leaned forward and lowered his voice.
04223	“Queer talking I have heard, of hungry fires within the mountain, and how Stannis and the red woman go down together to watch the flames.
04224	There are shafts, they say, and secret stairs down into the mountain’s heart, into hot places where only she may walk unburned.
04225	It is enough and more to give an old man such terrors that sometimes he can scarcely find the strength to eat.
04226	” Melisandre.
04227	Davos shivered.
04228	“The red woman did this to him,” he said.
04229	“She sent the fire to consume us, to punish Stannis for setting her aside, to teach him that he could not hope to win without her sorceries.
04230	” The Lyseni chose a plump olive from the bowl between them.
04231	“You are not the first to be saying this, my friend.
04232	But if I am you, I am not saying it so loudly.
04233	Dragonstone crawls with these queen’s men, oh yes, and they have sharp ears and sharper knives.
04234	” He popped the olive into his mouth.
04235	“I have a knife myself.
04236	Captain Khorane made me a gift of it.
04237	” He pulled out the dirk and laid it on the table between them.
04238	“A knife to cut out Melisandre’s heart.
04239	If she has one.
04240	” Salladhor Saan spit out an olive pit.
04241	“Davos, good Davos, you must not be saying such things, even in jest.
04242	” “No jest.
04243	I mean to kill her.
04244	”If she can be killed by mortal weapons.
04245	Davos was not certain that she could.
04246	He had seen old Maester Cressen slip poison into her wine, with his own eyes he had seen it, but when they both drank from the poisoned cup it was the maester who died, not the red priestess.
04247	A knife in the heart, though.
04248	even demons can be killed by cold iron, the singers say.
04249	“These are dangerous talkings, my friend,” Salladhor Saan warned him.
04250	“I am thinking you are still sick from the sea.
04251	The fever has cooked your wits, yes.
04252	Best you are taking to your bed for a long resting, until you are stronger.
04253	” Until my resolve weakens, you mean.
04254	Davos got to his feet.
04255	He did feel feverish and a little dizzy, but it did not matter.
04256	“You are a treacherous old rogue, Salladhor Saan, but a good friend all the same.
04257	” The Lyseni stroked his pointed silver beard.
04258	“So with this great friend you will be staying, yes?” “No, I will be going.

04264	Where will you be going?” “To the castle.
04265	My bed is there, and my son.
04266	” “And the red woman,” Salladhor Saan said suspiciously.
04267	“She is in the castle also.
04268	” “Her too.
04269	” Davos slid the dirk back into its sheath.
04270	“You are an onion smuggler, what do you know of skulkings and stabbings? And you are ill, you cannot even hold the dirk.
04271	Do you know what will be happening to you, if you are caught? While we were burning on the river, the queen was burning traitors.
04272	Servants of the dark , she named them, poor men, and the red woman sang as the fires were lit.
04273	” Davos was unsurprised.
04274	I knew , he thought,I knew before he told me.
04275	“She took Lord Sunglass from the dungeons,” he guessed, “and Hubard Rambton’s sons.
04276	” “Just so, and burned them, as she will burn you.
04277	If you kill the red woman, they will burn you for revenge, and if you fail to kill her, they will burn you for the trying.
04278	She will sing and you will scream, and then you will die.
04279	And you have only just come back to life!” “And this is why,” said Davos.
04280	“To do this thing.
04281	To make an end of Melisandre of Asshai and all her works.
04282	Why else would the sea have spit me out? You knowBlackwaterBay as well as I do, Salla.
04283	No sensible captain would ever take his ship through the spears of the merling king and risk ripping out his bottom.
04284	Shayala’s Dance should never have come near me.
04285	” “A wind,” insisted Salladhor Saan loudly, “an ill wind, is all.
04286	A wind drove her too far to the south.
04287	” “And who sent the wind? Salla, the Mother spoke to me.
04288	” The old Lyseni blinked at him.
04289	“Your mother is dead.
04290	” “TheMother.
04291	She blessed me with seven sons, and yet I let them burn her.
04292	She spoke to me.
04293	Wecalled the fire, she said.
04294	We called the shadows too.
04295	I rowed Melisandre into the bowels of Storm’s End and watched her birth a horror.
04296	” He saw it still in his nightmares, the gaunt black hands pushing against her thighs as it wriggled free of her swollen womb.
04297	“She killed Cressen and Lord Renly and a brave man named Cortnay Penrose, and she killed my sons as well.
04298	Now it is time someone killed her.
04299	” “Someone,” said Salladhor Saan.
04300	“Yes, just so, someone.
04301	But not you.
04302	You are weak as a child, and no warrior.
04303	Stay, I beg you, we will talk more and you will eat, and perhaps we will sail to Braavos and hire a Faceless Man to do this thing, yes? But you, no, you must sit and eat.
04304	” He is making this much harder, thought Davos wearily,and it was perishingly hard to begin with.
04305	“I have vengeance in my belly, Salla.
04306	It leaves no room for food.
04307	Let me go now.
04308	For our friendship, wish me luck and let me go.
04309	” Salladhor Saan pushed himself to his feet.
04310	“You are no true friend, I am thinking.
04311	When you are dead, who will be bringing your ashes and bones back to your lady wife and telling her that she has lost a husband and four sons? Only sad old Salladhor Saan.
04312	But so be it, brave ser knight, go rushing to your grave.
04313	I will gather your bones in a sack and give them to the sons you leave behind, to wear in little bags around their necks.
04314	” He waved an angry hand, with rings on every finger.
04315	“Go, go, go, go, go.

04319	html Davos did not want to leave like this.
04320	“Salla—” “GO.
04321	Or stay, better, but if you are going, go.
04322	” He went.
04323	His walk up from theBountiful Harvest to the gates of Dragonstone was long and lonely.
04324	The dockside streets where soldiers and sailors and smallfolk had thronged were empty and deserted.
04325	Where once he had stepped around squealing pigs and naked children, rats scurried.
04326	His legs felt like pudding beneath him, and thrice the coughing racked him so badly that he had to stop and rest.
04327	No one came to help him, nor even peered through a window to see what was the matter.
04328	The windows were shuttered, the doors barred, and more than half the houses displayed some mark of mourning.
04329	Thousands sailed up the Blackwater Rush, and hundreds came back , Davos reflected.
04330	My sons did not die alone.
04331	May the Mother have mercy on them all.
04332	When he reached the castle gates, he found them shut as well.
04333	Davos pounded on the iron-studded wood with his fist.
04334	When there was no answer, he kicked at it, again and again.
04335	Finally a crossbowman appeared atop the barbican, peering down between two towering gargoyles.
04336	“Who goes there?” He craned his head back and cupped his hands around his mouth.
04337	“Ser Davos Seaworth, to see His Grace.
04338	” “Are you drunk? Go away and stop that pounding.
04339	” Salladhor Saan had warned him.
04340	Davos tried a different tack.
04341	“Send for my son, then.
04342	Devan, the king’s squire.
04343	” The guard frowned.
04344	“Who did you say you were?” “Davos,” he shouted.
04345	“The onion knight.
04346	” The head vanished, to return a moment later.
04347	“Be off with you.
04348	The onion knight died on the river.
04349	His ship burned.
04350	” “His ship burned,” Davos agreed, “but he lived, and here he stands.
04351	Is Jate still captain of the gate?” “Who?” “Jate Blackberry.
04352	He knows me well enough.
04353	” “I never heard of him.
04354	Most like he’s dead.
04355	” “Lord Chyttering, then.
04356	” “That one I know.
04357	He burned on the Blackwater.
04358	” “Hookface Will? Hal the Hog?” “Dead and dead,” the crossbowman said, but his face betrayed a sudden doubt.
04359	“You wait there.
04360	” He vanished again.

04364	html Davos waited.
04365	Gone, all gone , he thought dully, remembering how fat Hal’s white belly always showed beneath his grease-stained doublet, the long scar the fish hook had left across Will’s face, the way Jate always doffed his cap at the women, be they five or fifty, highborn or low.
04366	Drowned or burned, with my sons and a thousand others, gone to make a king in hell.
04367	Suddenly the crossbowman was back.
04368	“Go round to the sally port and they’ll admit you.
04369	” Davos did as he was bid.
04370	The guards who ushered him inside were strangers to him.
04371	They carried spears, and on their breasts they wore the fox-and-flowers sigil of House Florent.
04372	They escorted him not to the Stone Drum, as he’d expected, but under the arch of the Dragon’s Tail and down to Aegon’s Garden.
04373	“Wait here,” their sergeant told him.
04374	“Does His Grace know that I’ve returned?” asked Davos.
04375	“Bugger all if I know.
04376	Wait, I said.
04377	” The man left, taking his spearmen with him.
04378	Aegon’s Garden had a pleasant piney smell to it, and tall dark trees rose on every side.
04379	There were wild roses as well, and towering thorny hedges, and a boggy spot where cranberries grew.
04380	Why have they brought me here?Davos wondered.
04381	Then he heard a faint ringing of bells, and a child’s giggle, and suddenly the fool Patchface popped from the bushes, shambling along as fast as he could go with the Princess Shireen hot on his heels.
04382	“You come back now,” she was shouting after him.
04383	“Patches, you come back.
04384	” When the fool saw Davos, he jerked to a sudden halt, the bells on his antlered tin helmet going ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling.
04385	Hopping from one foot to the other, he sang, “Fool’s blood, king’s blood, blood on the maiden’s thigh, but chains for the guests and chains for the bridegroom, aye aye aye.
04386	” Shireen almost caught him then, but at the last instant he hopped over a patch of bracken and vanished among the trees.
04387	The princess was right behind him.
04388	The sight of them made Davos smile.
04389	He had turned to cough into his gloved hand when another small shape crashed out of the hedge and bowled right into him, knocking him off his feet.
04390	The boy went down as well, but he was up again almost at once.
04391	“What are you doing here?” he demanded as he brushed himself off.
04392	Jet-black hair fell to his collar, and his eyes were a startling blue.
04393	“You shouldn’t get in my way when I’m running.
04394	” “No,” Davos agreed.
04395	“I shouldn’t.
04396	” Another fit of coughing seized him as he struggled to his knees.
04397	“Are you unwell?” The boy took him by the arm and pulled him to his feet.
04398	“Should I summon the maester?” Davos shook his head.
04399	“A cough.
04400	It will pass.
04401	” The boy took him at his word.
04402	“We were playing monsters and maidens, “ he explained.
04403	“I was the monster.
04404	It’s a childish game but my cousin likes it.
04405	Do you have a name?” “Ser Davos Seaworth.
04406	” The boy looked him up and down dubiously.
04407	“Are you certain? You don’t look very knightly.

04411	html “I am the knight of the onions, my lord.
04412	” The blue eyes blinked.
04413	“The one with the black ship?” “You know that tale?” “You brought my uncle Stannis fish to eat before I was born, when Lord Tyrell had him under siege.
04414	” The boy drew himself up tall.
04415	“I am Edric Storm,” he announced.
04416	“King Robert’s son.
04417	” “Of course you are.
04418	” Davos had known that almost at once.
04419	The lad had the prominent ears of a Florent, but the hair, the eyes, the jaw, the cheekbones, those were all Baratheon.
04420	“Did you know my father?” Edric Storm demanded.
04421	“I saw him many a time while calling on your uncle at court, but we never spoke.
04422	” “My father taught me to fight,” the boy said proudly.
04423	“He came to see me almost every year, and sometimes we trained together.
04424	On my last name day he sent me a warhammer just like his, only smaller.
04425	They made me leave it at Storm’s End, though.
04426	Is it true my uncle Stannis cut off your fingers?” “Only the last joint.
04427	I still have fingers, only shorter.
04428	” “Show me.
04429	” Davos peeled his glove off.
04430	The boy studied his hand carefully.
04431	“He did not shorten your thumb?” “No.
04432	” Davos coughed.
04433	“No, he left me that.
04434	” “He should not have chopped any of your fingers,” the lad decided.
04435	“That was ill done.
04436	” “I was a smuggler.
04437	” “Yes, but you smuggled him fish and onions.
04438	” “Lord Stannis knighted me for the onions, and took my fingers for the smuggling.
04439	” He pulled his glove back on.
04440	“My father would not have chopped your fingers.
04441	” “As you say, my lord.
04442	”Robert was a different man than Stannis, true enough.
04443	The boy is like him.
04444	Aye, and like Renly as well.
04445	That thought made him anxious.
04446	The boy was about to say something more when they heard steps.
04447	Davos turned.
04448	Ser Axell Florent was coming down the garden path with a dozen guards in quilted jerkins.
04449	On their breasts they wore the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.
04450	Queen’s men , Davos thought.
04451	A cough came on him suddenly.
04452	Ser Axell was short and muscular, with a barrel chest, thick arms, bandy legs, and hair growing from his ears.
04453	The queen’s uncle, he had served as castellan of Dragonstone for a decade, and had always treated Davos courteously, knowing he enjoyed the favor of Lord Stannis.
04454	But there was neither courtesy nor warmth in his tone as he said, “Ser Davos, and undrowned.

04459	Have you come to take me to the king?” “I have come to take you to the dungeon.
04460	” Ser Axell waved his men forward.
04461	“Seize him, and take his dirk.
04462	He means to use it on our lady.
04463	” Chapter Eleven Jaime Jaime was the first to spy the inn.
04464	The main building hugged the south shore where the river bent, its long low wings outstretched along the water as if to embrace travelers sailing downstream.
04465	The lower story was grey stone, the upper whitewashed wood, the roof slate.
04466	He could see stables as well, and an arbor heavy with vines.
04467	“No smoke from the chimneys,” he pointed out as they approached.
04468	“Nor lights in the windows.
04469	” “The inn was still open when last I passed this way,” said Ser Cleos Frey.
04470	“They brewed a fine ale.
04471	Perhaps there is still some to be had in the cellars.
04472	” “There may be people,” Brienne said.
04473	“Hiding.
04474	Or dead.
04475	” “Frightened of a few corpses, wench?” Jaime said.
04476	She glared at him.
04477	“My name is—” “—Brienne, yes.
04478	Wouldn’t you like to sleep in a bed for a night, Brienne? We’d be safer than on the open river, and it might be prudent to find what’s happened here.
04479	” She gave no answer, but after a moment she pushed at the tiller to angle the skiff in toward the weathered wooden dock.
04480	Ser Cleos scrambled to take down the sail.
04481	When they bumped softly against the pier, he climbed out to tie them up.
04482	Jaime clambered after him, made awkward by his chains.
04483	At the end of the dock, a flaking shingle swung from an iron post, painted with the likeness of a king upon his knees, his hands pressed together in the gesture of fealty.
04484	Jaime took one look and laughed aloud.
04485	“We could not have found a better inn.
04486	” “Is this some special place?” the wench asked, suspicious.
04487	Ser Cleos answered.
04488	“This is theInn of the Kneeling Man, my lady.
04489	It stands upon the very spot where the last King in the North knelt before Aegon the Conqueror to offer his submission.
04490	That’s him on the sign, I suppose.
04491	” “Torrhen had brought his power south after the fall of the two kings on the Field of Fire,” said Jaime, “but when he saw Aegon’s dragon and the size of his host, he chose the path of wisdom and bent his frozen knees.
04492	” He stopped at the sound of a horse’s whinny.
04493	“Horses in the stable.
04494	One at least.
04495	”And one is all I need to put the wench behind me.
04496	“Let’s see who’s home, shall we?” Without waiting for an answer, Jaime went clinking down the dock, put a shoulder to the door, shoved it open.
04497	and found himself eye to eye with a loaded crossbow.
04498	Standing behind it was a chunky boy of fifteen.
04499	“Lion, fish, or wolf?” the lad demanded.
04500	“We were hoping for capon.
04501	” Jaime heard his companions entering behind him.
04502	“The crossbow is a Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.

04506	” “It’ll put a bolt through your heart all the same.
04507	” “Perhaps.
04508	But before you can wind it again my cousin here will spill your entrails on the floor.
04509	” “Don’t be scaring the lad, now,” Ser Cleos said.
04510	“We mean no harm,” the wench said.
04511	“And we have coin to pay for food and drink.
04512	” She dug a silver piece from her pouch.
04513	The boy looked suspiciously at the coin, and then at Jaime’s manacles.
04514	“Why’s this one in irons?” “Killed some crossbowmen,” said Jaime.
04515	“Do you have ale?” “Yes.
04516	” The boy lowered the crossbow an inch.
04517	“Undo your swordbelts and let them fall, and might be we’ll feed you.
04518	” He edged around to peer through the thick, diamond-shaped windowpanes and see if any more of them were outside.
04519	“That’s a Tully sail.
04520	” “We come from Riverrun.
04521	” Brienne undid the clasp on her belt and let it clatter to the floor.
04522	Ser Cleos followed suit.
04523	A sallow man with a pocked doughy face stepped through the cellar door, holding a butcher’s heavy cleaver.
04524	“Three, are you? We got horsemeat enough for three.
04525	The horse was old and tough, but the meat’s still fresh.
04526	” “Is there bread?” asked Brienne.
04527	“Hardbread and stale oatcakes.
04528	” Jaime grinned.
04529	“Now there’s an honest innkeep.
04530	They’ll all serve you stale bread and stringy meat, but most don’t own up to it so freely.
04531	” “I’m no innkeep.
04532	I buried him out back, with his women.
04533	” “Did you kill them?” “Would I tell you if I did?” The man spat.
04534	“Likely it were wolves’ work, or maybe lions, what’s the difference? The wife and I found them dead.
04535	The way we see it, the place is ours now.
04536	” “Where is this wife of yours?” Ser Cleos asked.
04537	The man gave him a suspicious squint.
04538	“And why would you be wanting to know that? She’s not here.
04539	no more’n you three will be, unless I like the taste of your silver.
04540	” Brienne tossed the coin to him.
04541	He caught it in the air, bit it, and tucked it away.
04542	“She’s got more,” the boy with the crossbow announced.
04543	“So she does.

04548	html The lad raised the crossbow to his shoulder, gave them one last sullen look, and vanished into the cellar.
04549	“Your son?” Ser Cleos asked.
04550	“Just a boy the wife and me took in.
04551	We had two sons, but the lions killed one and the other died of the flux.
04552	The boy lost his mother to the Bloody Mummers.
04553	These days, a man needs someone to keep watch while he sleeps.
04554	” He waved the cleaver at the tables.
04555	“Might as well sit.
04556	” The hearth was cold, but Jaime picked the chair nearest the ashes and stretched out his long legs under the table.
04557	The clink of his chains accompanied his every movement.
04558	An irritating sound.
04559	Before this is done, I’ll wrap these chains around the wench’s throat, see how she likes them then.
04560	The man who wasn’t an innkeep charred three huge horse steaks and fried the onions in bacon grease, which almost made up for the stale oatcakes.
04561	Jaime and Cleos drank ale, Brienne a cup of cider.
04562	The boy kept his distance, perching atop the cider barrel with his crossbow across his knees, cocked and loaded.
04563	The cook drew a tankard of ale and sat with them.
04564	“What news from Riverrun?” he asked Ser Cleos, taking him for their leader.
04565	Ser Cleos glanced at Brienne before answering.
04566	“Lord Hoster is failing, but his son holds the fords of the Red Fork against the Lannisters.
04567	There have been battles.
04568	” “Battles everywhere.
04569	Where are you bound, ser?” “King’s Landing.
04570	” Ser Cleos wiped grease off his lips.
04571	Their host snorted.
04572	“Then you’re three fools.
04573	Last I heard, King Stannis was outside the city walls.
04574	They say he has a hundred thousand men and a magic sword.
04575	” Jaime’s hands wrapped around the chain that bound his wrists, and he twisted it taut, wishing for the strength to snap it in two.
04576	Then I’d show Stannis where to sheathe his magic sword.
04577	“I’d stay well clear of that kingsroad, if I were you,” the man went on.
04578	“it’s worse than bad, I hear.
04579	Wolves and lions both, and bands of broken men preying on anyone they can catch.
04580	” “Vermin,” declared Ser Cleos with contempt.
04581	“Such would never dare to trouble armed men.
04582	” “Begging your pardon, ser, but I see one armed man, traveling with a woman and a prisoner in chains.
04583	” Brienne gave the cook a dark look.
04584	The wench does hate being reminded that she’s a wench , Jaime reflected, twisting at the chains again.
04585	The links were cold and hard against his flesh, the iron implacable.
04586	The manacles had chafed his wrists raw.
04587	“I mean to follow the Trident to the sea,” the wench told their host.
04588	“We’ll find mounts at Maidenpool and ride by way of Duskendale and Rosby.
04589	That should keep us well away from the worst of the fighting.
04590	” Their host shook his head.
04591	“You’ll never reach Maidenpool by river.
04592	Not thirty miles from here a couple boats burned and sank, and the channel’s been silting up around them.
04593	There’s a nest of outlaws there preying on anyone tries to come by, and more of the same downriver around the Skipping Stones andRed DeerIsland.
04594	And the lightning lord’s been seen in these parts as well.

04600	“Lord Beric, as it please you, ser.
04601	They call him that ’cause he strikes so sudden, like lightning from a clear sky.
04602	It’s said he cannot die.
04603	” They all die when you shove a sword through them, Jaime thought.
04604	“Does Thoros of Myr still ride with him?” “Aye.
04605	The red wizard.
04606	I’ve heard tell he has strange powers.
04607	” Well, he had the power to match Robert Baratheon drink for drink, and there were few enough who could say that.
04608	Jaime had once heard Thoros tell the king that he became a red priest because the robes hid the winestains so well.
04609	Robert had laughed so hard he’d spit ale all over Cersei’s silken mantle.
04610	“Far be it from me to make objection,” he said, “but perhaps the Trident is not our safest course.
04611	” “I’d say that’s so,” their cook agreed.
04612	“Even if you get pastRed Deer island and don’t meet up with Lord Beric and the red wizard, there’s still the ruby ford before you.
04613	Last I heard, it was the Leech Lord’s wolves held the ford, but that was some time past.
04614	By now it could be lions again, or Lord Beric, or anyone.
04615	” “Or no one,” Brienne suggested.
04616	“If m’lady cares to wager her skin on that I won’t stop her.
04617	but if I was you, I’d leave this here river, cut overland.
04618	If you stay off the main roads and shelter under the trees of a night, hidden as it were.
04619	well, I still wouldn’t want to go with you, but you might stand a mummer’s chance.
04620	” The big wench was looking doubtful.
04621	“We would need horses.
04622	” “There are horses here,” Jaime pointed out.
04623	“I heard one in the stable.
04624	” “Aye, there are,” said the innkeep, who wasn’t an innkeep.
04625	“Three of them, as it happens, but they’re not for sale.
04626	” Jaime had to laugh.
04627	“Of course not.
04628	But you’ll show them to us anyway.
04629	” Brienne scowled, but the man who wasn’t an innkeep met her eyes without blinking, and after a moment, reluctantly, she said, “Show me,” and they all rose from the table.
04630	The stables had not been mucked out in a long while, from the smell of them.
04631	Hundreds of fat black flies swarmed amongst the straw, buzzing from stall to stall and crawling over the mounds of horse dung that lay everywhere, but there were only the three horses to be seen.
04632	They made an unlikely trio:: a lumbering brown plow horse, an ancient white gelding blind in one eye, and a knight’s palfrey, dapple grey and spirited.
04633	“They’re not for sale at any price,” their alleged owner announced.
04634	“How did you come by these horses?” Brienne wanted to know.
04635	“The dray was stabled here when the wife and me come on the inn,” the man said, “along with the one you just ate.

04642	The saddlecloth had originally been checkered pink and black, but now it was mostly brown.
04643	Jaime did not recognize the original colors, but he recognized bloodstains easily enough.
04644	“Well, her owner won’t be coming to claim her anytime soon.

04646	“Give him a gold piece for the grey, if he’ll include the saddle,” he advised Brienne.
04647	“A silver for the plow horse.
04648	He ought to pay us for taking the white off his hands.
04649	” “Don’t speak discourteously of your horse, ser.
04650	” The wench opened the purse Lady Catelyn had given her and took out three golden coins.
04651	“I will pay you a dragon for each.
04652	” He blinked and reached for the gold, then hesitated and drew his hand back.
04653	“I don’t know.
04654	I can’t ride no golden dragon if I need to get away.
04655	Nor eat one if I’m hungry.
04656	” “You can have our skiff as well,” she said.
04657	“Sail up the river or down, as you like.
04658	” “Let me have a taste o’ that gold.
04659	” The man took one of the coins from her palm and bit it.
04660	“Hm.
04661	Real enough, I’d say.
04662	Three dragons and the skiff?” “He’s robbing you blind, wench,” Jaime said amiably.
04663	“I’ll want provisions too,” Brienne told their host, ignoring Jaime.
04664	“Whatever you have that you can spare.
04665	” “There’s more oatcakes.
04666	” The man scooped the other two dragons from her palm and jingled them in his fist, smiling at the sound they made.
04667	“Aye, and smoked salt fish, but that will cost you silver.
04668	My beds will be costing as well.
04669	You’ll be wanting to stay the night.
04670	” “No,” Brienne said at once.
04671	The man frowned at her.
04672	“Woman, you don’t want to go riding at night through strange country on horses you don’t know.
04673	You’re like to blunder into some bog or break your horse’s leg.
04674	” “The moon will be bright tonight,” Brienne said.
04675	“We’ll have no trouble finding our way.
04676	” Their host chewed on that.
04677	“If you don’t have the silver, might be some coppers would buy you them beds, and a coverlet or two to keep you warm.
04678	It’s not like I’m turning travelers away, if you get my meaning.
04679	” “That sounds more than fair,” said Ser Cleos.
04680	“The coverlets is fresh washed, too.
04681	My wife saw to that before she had to go off.
04682	Not a flea to be found neither, you have my word on that.
04683	” He jingled the coins again, smiling.
04684	Ser Cleos was plainly tempted.
04685	“A proper bed would do us all good, my lady,” he said to Brienne.
04686	“We’d make better time on the morrow once refreshed.
04687	” He looked to his cousin for support.
04688	“No, coz, the wench is right.
04689	We have promises to keep, and long leagues before us.
04690	We ought ride on.
04691	” “But,” said Cleos, “you said yourself—” “Then.
04692	”When I thought the inn deserted.
04693	“Now I have a full belly, and a moonlight ride will be just the Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.

04696	html thing.
04697	” He smiled for the wench.
04698	“But unless you mean to throw me over the back of that plow horse like a sack of flour, someone had best do something about these irons.
04699	It’s difficult to ride with your ankles chained together.
04700	” Brienne frowned at the chain.
04701	The man who wasn’t an innkeep rubbed his jaw.
04702	“There’s a smithy round back of the stable.
04703	” “Show me,” Brienne said.
04704	“Yes,” said Jaime, “and the sooner the better.
04705	There’s far too much horse shit about here for my taste.
04706	I would hate to step in it.
04707	” He gave the wench a sharp look, wondering if she was bright enough to take his meaning.
04708	He hoped she might strike the irons off his wrists as well, but Brienne was still suspicious.
04709	She split the ankle chain in the center with a half-dozen sharp blows from the smith’s hammer delivered to the blunt end of a steel chisel.
04710	When he suggested that she break the wrist chain as well, she ignored him.
04711	“Six miles downriver you’ll see a burned village,” their host said as he was helping them saddle the horses and load their packs.
04712	This time he directed his counsel at Brienne.
04713	“The road splits there.
04714	If you turn south, you’ll come on Ser Warren’s stone towerhouse.
04715	Ser Warren went off and died, so I couldn’t say who holds it now, but it’s a place best shunned.
04716	You’d do better to follow the track through the woods, south by east.
04717	” “We shall,” she answered.
04718	“You have my thanks.
04719	” More to the point, he has your gold.
04720	Jaime kept the thought to himself.
04721	He was tired of being disregarded by this huge ugly cow of a woman.
04722	She took the plow horse for herself and assigned the palfrey to Ser Cleos.
04723	As threatened, Jaime drew the one-eyed gelding, which put an end to any thoughts he might have had of giving his horse a kick and leaving the wench in his dust.
04724	The man and the boy came out to watch them leave.
04725	The man wished them luck and told them to come back in better times, while the lad stood silent, his crossbow under his arm.
04726	“Take up the spear or maul,” Jaime told him, “they’ll serve you better.
04727	” The boy stared at him distrustfully.
04728	So much for friendly advice.
04729	He shrugged, turned his horse, and never looked back.
04730	Ser Cleos was all complaints as they rode out, still in mourning for his lost featherbed.
04731	They rode east, along the bank of the moonlit river.
04732	The Red Fork was very broad here, but shallow, its banks all mud and reeds.
04733	Jaime’s mount plodded along placidly, though the poor old thing had a tendency to want to drift off to the side of his good eye.
04734	It felt good to be mounted once more.
04735	He had not been on a horse since Robb Stark’s archers had killed his destrier under him in the Whispering Wood.
04736	When they reached the burned village, a choice of equally unpromising roads confronted them:: narrow tracks, deeply rutted by the carts of farmers hauling their grain to the river.
04737	One wandered off toward the southeast and soon vanished amidst the trees they could see in the distance, while the other, straighter and stonier, arrowed due south.
04738	Brienne considered them briefly, and then swung her horse onto the southern road.
04739	Jaime was pleasantly surprised:: it was the same choice he would have made.
04740	“But this is the road the innkeep warned us against,” Ser Cleos objected.

04744	html “He was no innkeep.
04745	” She hunched gracelessly in the saddle, but seemed to have a sure seat nonetheless.
04746	“The man took too great an interest in our choice of route, and those woods.
04747	such places are notorious haunts of outlaws.
04748	He may have been urging us into a trap.
04749	” “Clever wench.
04750	” Jaime smiled at his cousin.
04751	“Our host has friends down that road, I would venture.
04752	The ones whose mounts gave that stable such a memorable aroma.
04753	” “He may have been lying about the river as well, to put us on these horses,” the wench said, “but I could not take the risk.
04754	There will be soldiers at the ruby ford and the crossroads.
04755	” Well, she may be ugly but she’s not entirely stupid.
04756	Jaime gave her a grudging smile.
04757	The ruddy light from the upper windows of the stone towerhouse gave them warning of its presence a long way off, and Brienne led them off into the fields.
04758	Only when the stronghold was well to the rear did they angle back and find the road again.
04759	Half the night passed before the wench allowed that it might be safe to stop.
04760	By then all three of them were drooping in their saddles.
04761	They sheltered in a small grove of oak and ash beside a sluggish stream.
04762	The wench would allow no fire, so they shared a midnight supper of stale oatcakes and salt fish.
04763	The night was strangely peaceful.
04764	The half-moon sat overhead in a black felt sky, surrounded by stars.
04765	Off in the distance, some wolves were howling.
04766	One of their horses whickered nervously.
04767	There was no other sound.
04768	The war has not touched this place , Jaime thought.
04769	He was glad to be here, glad to be alive, glad to be on his way back to Cersei.
04770	“I’ll take the first watch,” Brienne told Ser Cleos, and Frey was soon snoring softly.
04771	Jaime sat against the bole of an oak and wondered what Cersei and Tyrion were doing just now.
04772	“Do you have any siblings, my lady?” he asked.
04773	Brienne squinted at him suspiciously.
04774	“No.
04775	I was my father’s only s—child.
04776	” Jaime chuckled.
04777	“Son, you meant to say.
04778	Does he think of you as a son? You make a queer sort of daughter, to be sure.
04779	” Wordless, she turned away from him, her knuckles tight on her sword hilt.
04780	What a wretched creature this one is.
04781	She reminded him of Tyrion in some queer way, though at first blush two people could scarcely be any more dissimilar.
04782	Perhaps it was that thought of his brother that made him say, “I did not intend to give offense, Brienne.
04783	Forgive me.
04784	” “Your crimes are past forgiving, Kingslayer.
04785	” “That name again.
04786	” Jaime twisted idly at his chains.
04787	“Why do I enrage you so? I’ve never done you harm that I know of.
04788	” “You’ve harmed others.
04789	Those you were sworn to protect.
04790	The weak, the innocent.
04791	” “.
04792	the king?” It always came back to Aerys.
04793	“Don’t presume to judge what you do not understand, wench.

04797	html “—Brienne, yes.
04798	Has anyone ever told you that you’re as tedious as you are ugly?” “You will not provoke me to anger, Kingslayer.
04799	” “Oh, I might, if I cared enough to try.
04800	” “Why did you take the oath?” she demanded.
04801	“Why don the white cloak if you meant to betray all it stood for?” Why?What could he say that she might possibly understand? “I was a boy.
04802	Fifteen.
04803	It was a great honor for one so young.
04804	” “That is no answer,” she said scornfully.
04805	You would not like the truth.
04806	He had joined the Kingsguard for love, of course.
04807	Their father had summoned Cersei to court when she was twelve, hoping to make her a royal marriage.
04808	He refused every offer for her hand, preferring to keep her with him in the Tower of the Hand while she grew older and more womanly and ever more beautiful.
04809	No doubt he was waiting for Prince Viserys to mature, or perhaps for Rhaegar’s wife to die in childbed.
04810	Elia of Dorne was never the healthiest of women.
04811	Jaime, meantime, had spent four years as squire to Ser Sumner Crakehall and earned his spurs against the Kingswood Brotherhood.
04812	But when he made a brief call at King’s Landing on his way back to Casterly Rock, chiefly to see his sister, Cersei took him aside and whispered that Lord Tywin meant to marry him to Lysa Tully, had gone so far as to invite Lord Hoster to the city to discuss dower.
04813	But if Jaime took the white, he could be near her always.
04814	Old Ser Harlan Grandison had died in his sleep, as was only appropriate for one whose sigil was a sleeping lion.
04815	Aerys would want a young man to take his place, so why not a roaring lion in place of a sleepy one? “Father will never consent,” Jaime objected.
04816	“The king won’t ask him.
04817	And once it’s done, Father can’t object, not openly.
04818	Aerys had Ser Ilyn Payne’s tongue torn out just for boasting that it was the Hand who truly ruled the Seven Kingdoms.
04819	The captain of the Hand’s guard, and yet Father dared not try and stop it! He won’t stop this, either.
04820	” “But,” Jaime said, “there’s Casterly Rock.
04821	” “Is it a rock you want? Or me?” He remembered that night as if it were yesterday.
04822	They spent it in an old inn on Eel Alley, well away from watchful eyes.
04823	Cersei had come to him dressed as a simple serving wench, which somehow excited him all the more.
04824	Jaime had never seen her more passionate.
04825	Every time he went to sleep, she woke him again.
04826	By morning Casterly Rock seemed a small price to pay to be near her always.
04827	He gave his consent, and Cersei promised to do the rest.
04828	A moon’s turn later, a royal raven arrived at Casterly Rock to inform him that he had been chosen for the Kingsguard.
04829	He was commanded to present himself to the king during the great tourney at Harrenhal to say his vows and don his cloak.
04830	Jaime’s investiture freed him from Lysa Tully.
04831	Elsewise, nothing went as planned.
04832	His father had never Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.

04834	com/abclit.
04835	html been more furious.
04836	He could not object openly—Cersei had judged that correctly—but he resigned the Handship on some thin pretext and returned to Casterly Rock, taking his daughter with him.
04837	Instead of being together, Cersei and Jaime just changed places, and he found himself alone at court, guarding a mad king while four lesser men took their turns dancing on knives in his father’s ill-fitting shoes.
04838	So swiftly did the Hands rise and fall that Jaime remembered their heraldry better than their faces.
04839	The horn-of-plenty Hand and the dancing griffins Hand had both been exiled, the mace-and-dagger Hand dipped in wildfire and burned alive.
04840	Lord Rossart had been the last.
04841	His sigil had been a burning torch:: an unfortunate choice, given the fate of his predecessor, but the alchemist had been elevated largely because he shared the king’s passion for fire.
04842	I ought to have drowned Rossart instead of gutting him.
04843	Brienne was still awaiting his answer.
04844	Jaime said, “You are not old enough to have known Aerys Targaryen.
04845	” She would not hear it.
04846	“Aerys was mad and cruel, no one has ever denied that.
04847	He was still king, crowned and anointed.
04848	And you had swom to protect him.
04849	” “I know what I swore.
04850	” “And what you did.
04851	” She loomed above him, six feet of freckled, frowning, horse-toothed disapproval.
04852	“Yes, and whatyou did as well.
04853	We’re both kingslayers here, if what I’ve heard is true.
04854	” “I never harmed Renly.
04855	I’ll kill the man who says I did.
04856	” “Best start with Cleos, then.
04857	And you’ll have a deal of killing to do after that, the way he tells the tale.
04858	” “Lies.
04859	Lady Catelyn was there when His Grace was murdered, she saw.
04860	There was a shadow.
04861	The candles guttered and the air grew cold, and there was blood—” “Oh, very good.
04862	” Jaime laughed.
04863	“Your wits are quicker than mine, I confess it.
04864	When they found me standing over my dead king, I never thought to say, ‘No, no, it wasn’t me, it was a shadow, a terrible cold shadow.
04865	’ ” He laughed again.
04866	“Tell me true, one kingslayer to another—did the Starks pay you to slit his throat, or was it Stannis? Had Renly spurned you, was that the way of it? Or perhaps your moon’s blood was on you.
04867	Never give a wench a sword when she’s bleeding.
04868	” For a moment Jaime thought Brienne might strike him.
04869	A step closer, and I’ll snatch that dagger from her sheath and bury it up her womb.
04870	He gathered a leg under him, ready to spring, but the wench did not move.
04871	“It is a rare and precious gift to be a knight,” she said, “and even more so a knight of the Kingsguard.
04872	It is a gift given to few, a gift you scorned and soiled.
04873	” A gift you want desperately, wench, and can never have.
04874	“I earned my knighthood.
04875	Nothing was given to me.
04876	I won a tourney mêlée at thirteen, when I was yet a squire.
04877	At fifteen, I rode with Ser Arthur Dayne against the Kingswood Brotherhood, and he knighted me on the battlefield.
04878	It was that white cloak that soiled me, not the other way around.
04879	So spare me your envy.
04880	It was the gods who neglected to give you a cock, not me.
04881	” The look Brienne gave him then was full of loathing.
04882	She would gladly hack me to pieces, but for her precious vow , he reflected.
04883	Good.
04884	I’ve had enough of feeble pieties and maidens’ judgments.
04885	The wench stalked off without saying a word.
04886	Jaime curled up beneath his cloak, hoping to dream of Cersei.
04887	But when he closed his eyes, it was Aerys Targaryen he saw, pacing alone in his throne room, picking at Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.

04889	com/abclit.
04890	html his scabbed and bleeding hands.
04891	The fool was always cutting himself on the blades and barbs of the Iron Throne.
04892	Jaime had slipped in through the king’s door, clad in his golden armor, sword in hand.
04893	The golden armor, not the white, but no one ever remembers that.
04894	Would that I had taken off that damned cloak as well.
04895	When Aerys saw the blood on his blade, he demanded to know if it was Lord Tywin’s.
04896	“I want him dead, the traitor.
04897	I want his head, you’ll bring me his head, or you’ll burn with all the rest.
04898	All the traitors.
04899	Rossart says they areinside the walls! He’s gone to make them a warm welcome.
04900	Whose blood? Whose? ” “Rossart’s,” answered Jaime.
04901	Those purple eyes grew huge then, and the royal mouth drooped open in shock.
04902	He lost control of his bowels, turned, and ran for the Iron Throne.
04903	Beneath the empty eyes of the skulls on the walls, Jaime hauled the last dragonking bodily off the steps, squealing like a pig and smelling like a privy.
04904	A single slash across his throat was all it took to end it.
04905	So easy , he remembered thinking.
04906	A king should die harder than this.
04907	Rossart at least had tried to make a fight of it, though if truth be told he fought like an alchemist.
04908	Queer that they never ask who killed Rossart.
04909	but of course, he was no one, lowborn, Hand for a fortnight, just another mad fancy of the Mad King.
04910	Ser Elys Westerling and Lord Crakehall and others of his father’s knights burst into the hall in time to see the last of it, so there was no way for Jaime to vanish and let some braggart steal the praise or blame.
04911	It would be blame, he knew at once when he saw the way they looked at him.
04912	though perhaps that was fear.
04913	Lannister or no, he was one of Aerys’s seven.
04914	“The castle is ours, ser, and the city,” Roland Crakehall told him, which was half true.
04915	Targaryen loyalists were still dying on the serpentine steps and in the armory, Gregor Clegane and Amory Lorch were scaling the walls of Maegor’s Holdfast, and Ned Stark was leading his northmen through the King’s Gate even then, but Crakehall could not have known that.
04916	He had not seemed surprised to find Aerys slain:: Jaime had been Lord Tywin’s son long before he had been named to the Kingsguard.
04917	“Tell them the Mad King is dead,” he commanded.
04918	“Spare all those who yield and hold them captive.
04919	” “Shall I proclaim a new king as well?” Crakehall asked, and Jaime read the question plain: Shall it be your father, or Robert Baratheon, or do you mean to try to make a new dragonking? He thought for a moment of the boy Viserys, fled to Dragonstone, and of Rhaegar’s infant son Aegon, still in Maegor’s with his mother.
04920	A new Targaryen king, and my father as Hand.
04921	How the wolves will howl, and the storm lord choke with rage.
04922	For a moment he was tempted, until he glanced down again at the body on the floor, in its spreading pool of blood.
04923	His blood is in both of them , he thought.
04924	“Proclaim who you bloody well like,” he told Crakehall.
04925	Then he climbed the Iron Throne and seated himself with his sword across his knees, to see who would come to claim the kingdom.
04926	As it happened, it had been Eddard Stark.
04927	You had no right to judge me either, Stark.
04928	In his dreams the dead came burning, gowned in swirling green flames.
04929	Jaime danced around them with a golden sword, but for every one he struck down two more arose to take his place.
04930	Brienne woke him with a boot in the ribs.
04931	The world was still black, and it had begun to rain.
04932	They broke their fast on oatcakes, salt fish, and some blackberries that Ser Cleos had found, and were back in the saddle before the sun came up.

04936	html Chapter Twelve Tyrion The eunuch was humming tunelessly to himself as he came through the door, dressed in flowing robes of peach-colored silk and smelling of lemons.
04937	When he saw Tyrion seated by the hearth, he stopped and grew very still.
04938	“My lord Tyrion,” came out in a squeak, punctuated by a nervous giggle.
04939	“So youdo remember me? I had begun to wonder.
04940	” “It is so very good to see you looking so strong and well.
04941	” Varys smiled his slimiest smile.
04942	“Though I confess, I had not thought to find you in mine own humble chambers.
04943	” “They are humble.
04944	Excessively so, in truth.
04945	” Tyrion had waited until Varys was summoned by his father before slipping in to pay him a visit.
04946	The eunuch’s apartments were sparse and small, three snug windowless chambers under the north wall.
04947	“I’d hoped to discover bushel baskets of juicy secrets to while away the waiting, but there’s not a paper to be found.
04948	” He’d searched for hidden passages too, knowing the Spider must have ways of coming and going unseen, but those had proved equally elusive.
04949	“There waswater in your flagon, gods have mercy,” he went on, “your sleeping cell is no wider than a coffin, and that bed.
04950	is it actually made of stone, or does it only feel that way?” Varys closed the door and barred it.
04951	“I am plagued with backaches, my lord, and prefer to sleep upon a hard surface.
04952	” “I would have taken you for a featherbed man.
04953	” “I am full of surprises.
04954	Are you cross with me for abandoning you after the battle?” “It made me think of you as one of my family.
04955	” “It was not for want of love, my good lord.
04956	I have such a delicate disposition, and your scar is so dreadful to look upon.
04957	” He gave an exaggerated shudder.
04958	“Your poor nose.
04959	” Tyrion rubbed irritably at the scab.
04960	“Perhaps I should have a new one made of gold.
04961	What sort of nose would you suggest, Varys? One like yours, to smell out secrets? Or should I tell the goldsmith that I want my father’s nose?” He smiled.
04962	“My noble father labors so diligently that I scarce see him anymore.
04963	Tell me, is it true that he’s restoring Grand Maester Pycelle to the small council?” “It is, my lord.
04964	” “Do I have my sweet sister to thank for that?” Pycelle had been his sister’s creature:: Tyrion had stripped the man of office, beard, and dignity, and flung him down into a black cell.
04965	“Not at all, my lord.
04966	Thank the archmaesters of Oldtown, those who wished to insist on Pycelle’s restoration on the grounds that only the Conclave may make or unmake a Grand Maester.
04967	” Bloody fools, thought Tyrion.

04974	html “Alas, I am quite dragonless.
04975	I suppose I could have dipped Pycelle in wildfire and set him ablaze.
04976	Would the Citadel have preferred that?” “Well, it would have been more in keeping with tradition.
04977	” The eunuch tittered.
04978	“Thankfully, wiser heads prevailed, and the Conclave accepted the fact of Pycelle’s dismissal and set about choosing his successor.
04979	After giving due consideration to Maester Turquin the cordwainer’s son and Maester Erreck the hedge knight’s bastard, and thereby demonstrating to their own satisfaction that ability counts for more than birth in their order, the Conclave was on the verge of sending us Maester Gormon, a Tyrell of Highgarden.
04980	When I told your lord father, he acted at once.
04981	” The Conclave met in Oldtown behind closed doors, Tyrion knew:: its deliberations were supposedly a secret.
04982	So Varys has little birds in the Citadel too.
04983	“I see.
04984	So my father decided to nip the rose before it bloomed.
04985	” He had to chuckle.
04986	“Pycelle is a toad.
04987	But better a Lannister toad than a Tyrell toad, no?” “Grand Maester Pycelle has always been a good friend to your House,” Varys said sweetly.
04988	“Perhaps it will console you to learn that Ser Boros Blount is also being restored.
04989	” Cersei had stripped Ser Boros of his white cloak for failing to die in the defense of Prince Tommen when Bronn had seized the boy on the Rosby road.
04990	The man was no friend of Tyrion’s, but after that he likely hated Cersei almost as much.
04991	I suppose that’s something.
04992	“Blount is a blustering coward,” he said amiably.
04993	“Is he? Oh dear.
04994	Still, the knights of the Kingsguarddo serve for life, traditionally.
04995	Perhaps Ser Boros will prove braver in future.
04996	He will no doubt remain very loyal.
04997	” “To my father,” said Tyrion pointedly.
04998	“While we are on the subject of the Kingsguard.
04999	I wonder, could this delightfully unexpected visit of yours happen to concern Ser Boros’s fallen brother, the gallant Ser Mandon Moore?” The eunuch stroked a powdered cheek.
05000	“Your man Bronn seems most interested in him of late.
05001	” Bronn had turned up all he could on Ser Mandon, but no doubt Varys knew a deal more.
05002	should he choose to share it.
05003	“The man seems to have been quite friendless,” Tyrion said carefully.
05004	“Sadly,” said Varys, “oh, sadly.
05005	You might find some kin if you turned over enough stones back in the Vale, but here.
05006	Lord Arryn brought him to King’s Landing and Robert gave him his white cloak, but neither loved him much, I fear.
05007	Nor was he the sort the smallfolk cheer in tourneys, despite his undoubted prowess.
05008	Why, even his brothers of the Kingsguard never warmed to him.
05009	Ser Barristan was once heard to say that the man had no friend but his sword and no life but duty.
05010	but you know, I do not think Selmy meant it altogether as praise.
05011	Which is queer when you consider it, is it not? Those are the very qualities we seek in our Kingsguard, it could be said—men who live not for themselves, but for their king.
05012	By those lights, our brave Ser Mandon was the perfect white knight.
05013	And he died as a knight of the Kingsguard ought, with sword in hand, defending one of the king’s own blood.
05014	” The eunuch gave him a slimy smile and watched him sharply.
05015	Trying to murder one of the king’s own blood, you mean.
05016	Tyrion wondered if Varys knew rather more than he was saying.
05017	Nothing he’d just heard was new to him:: Bronn had brought back much the same reports.
05018	He needed a link to Cersei, some sign that Ser Mandon had been his sister’s catspaw.
05019	What we want is not always what we get , he reflected bitterly, which reminded him.
05020	“It is not Ser Mandon who brings me here.

05024	html “To be sure.
05025	” The eunuch crossed the room to his flagon of water.
05026	“May I serve you, my lord?” he asked as he filled a cup.
05027	“Yes.
05028	But not with water.
05029	” He folded his hands together.
05030	“I want you to bring me Shae.
05031	” Varys took a drink.
05032	“Is that wise, my lord? The dear sweet child.
05033	It would be such a shame if your father hanged her.
05034	” It did not surprise him that Varys knew.
05035	“No, it’s not wise, it’s bloody madness.
05036	I want to see her one last time, before I send her away.
05037	I cannot abide having her so close.
05038	” “I understand.
05039	” How could you?Tyrion had seen her only yesterday, climbing the serpentine steps with a pail of water.
05040	He had watched as a young knight had offered to carry the heavy pail.
05041	The way she had touched his arm and smiled for him had tied Tyrion’s guts into knots.
05042	They passed within inches of each other, him descending and her climbing, so close that he could smell the clean fresh scent of her hair.
05043	“M’lord,” she’d said to him, with a little curtsy, and he wanted to reach out and grab her and kiss her right there, but all he could do was nod stiffly and waddle on past.
05044	“I have seen her several times,” he told Varys, “but I dare not speak to her.
05045	I suspect that all my movements are being watched.
05046	” “You are wise to suspect so, my good lord.
05047	” “Who?” He cocked his head.
05048	“The Kettleblacks report frequently to your sweet sister.
05049	” “When I think of how much coin I paid those wretched.
05050	do you think there’s any chance that more gold might win them away from Cersei?” “There is always a chance, but I should not care to wager on the likelihood.
05051	They are knights now, all three, and your sister has promised them further advancement.
05052	” A wicked little titter burst from the eunuch’s lips.
05053	“And the eldest, Ser Osmund of the Kingsguard, dreams of certain other.
05054	favors.
05055	as well.
05056	You can match the queen coin for coin, I have no doubt, but she has a second purse that is quite inexhaustible.
05057	” Seven hells, thought Tyrion.
05058	“Are you suggesting that Cersei’s fucking Osmund Kettleblack?” “Oh, dear me, no, that would be dreadfully dangerous, don’t you think? No, the queen onlyhints.
05059	perhaps on the morrow, or when the wedding’s done.
05060	and then a smile, a whisper, a ribald jest.
05061	a breast brushing lightly against his sleeve as they pass.
05062	and yet it seems to serve.
05063	But what would a eunuch know of such things?” The tip of his tongue ran across his lower lip like a shy pink animal.
05064	If I could somehow push them beyond sly fondling, arrange for Father to catch them abed together.
05065	Tyrion fingered the scab on his nose.
05066	He did not see how it could be done, but perhaps some plan would come to him later.
05067	“Are the Kettleblacks the only ones?” “Would that were true, my lord.
05068	I fear there are many eyes upon you.
05069	You are.

05075	Should you be so unwise as to visit any of them, he will know at once, and your lord father soon thereafter.
05076	” It’s even worse than I feared.
05077	“And my father? Who does he have spying on me?” This time the eunuch laughed aloud.
05078	“Why, me, my lord.
05079	” Tyrion laughed as well.
05080	He was not so great a fool as to trust Varys any further than he had to—but the eunuch already knew enough about Shae to get her well and thoroughly hanged.
05081	“You will bring Shae to me through the walls, hidden from all these eyes.
05082	As you have done before.
05083	” Varys wrung his hands.
05084	“Oh, my lord, nothing would please me more, but.
05085	King Maegor wanted no rats in his own walls, if you take my meaning.
05086	He did require a means of secret egress, should he ever be trapped by his enemies, but that door does not connect with any other passages.
05087	I can steal your Shae away from Lady Lollys for a time, to be sure, but I have no way to bring her to your bedchamber without us being seen.
05088	” “Then bring her somewhere else.
05089	” “But where? There is no safe place.
05090	” “There is.
05091	” Tyrion grinned.
05092	“Here.
05093	It’s time to put that rock-hard bed of yours to better use, I think.
05094	” The eunuch’s mouth opened.
05095	Then he giggled.
05096	“Lollys tires easily these days.
05097	She is great with child.
05098	I imagine she will be safely asleep by moonrise.
05099	” Tyrion hopped down from the chair.
05100	“Moonrise, then.
05101	See that you lay in some wine.
05102	And two clean cups.
05103	” Varys bowed.
05104	“It shall be as my lord commands.
05105	” The rest of the day seemed to creep by as slow as a worm in molasses.
05106	Tyrion climbed to the castle library and tried to distract himself with Beldecar’sHistory of the Rhoynish Wars , but he could hardly see the elephants for imagining Shae’s smile.
05107	Come the afternoon, he put the book aside and called for a bath.
05108	He scrubbed himself until the water grew cool, and then had Pod even out his whiskers.
05109	His beard was a trial to him:: a tangle of yellow, white, and black hairs, patchy and coarse, it was seldom less than unsightly, but it did serve to conceal some of his face, and that was all to the good.
05110	When he was as clean and pink and trimmed as he was like to get, Tyrion looked over his wardrobe, and chose a pair of tight satin breeches in Lannister crimson and his best doublet, the heavy black velvet with the lion’s head studs.
05111	He would have donned his chain of golden hands as well, if his father hadn’t stolen it while he lay dying.
05112	It was not until he was dressed that he realized the depths of his folly.
05113	Seven hells, dwarf, did you lose all your sense along with your nose? Anyone who sees you is going to wonder why you’ve put on your court clothes to visit the eunuch.
05114	Cursing, Tyrion stripped and dressed again, in simpler garb:: black woolen breeches, an old white tunic, and a faded brown leather jerkin.
05115	It doesn’t matter , he told himself as he waited for moonrise.
05116	Whatever you wear, you’re still a dwarf.
05117	You’ll never be as tall as that knight on the steps, him with his long straight legs and hard stomach and wide manly shoulders.

05121	html on Varys.
05122	“Will you be long, my lord?” the boy asked.
05123	“Oh, I hope so.
05124	” With the Red Keep so crowded, Tyrion could not hope to go unnoticed.
05125	Ser Balon Swann stood guard on the door, and Ser Loras Tyrell on the drawbridge.
05126	He stopped to exchange pleasantries with both of them.
05127	It was strange to see the Knight of Flowers all in white when before he had always been as colorful as a rainbow.
05128	“How old are you, Ser Loras?” Tyrion asked him.
05129	“Seventeen, my lord.
05130	” Seventeen, and beautiful, and already a legend.
05131	Half the girls in the Seven Kingdoms want to bed him, and all the boys want to be him.
05132	“If you will pardon my asking, ser—why would anyone choose to join the Kingsguard at seventeen?” “Prince Aemon the Dragonknight took his vows at seventeen,” Ser Loras said, “and your brother Jaime was younger still.
05133	” “I know their reasons.
05134	What are yours? The honor of serving beside such paragons as Meryn Trant and Boros Blount?” He gave the boy a mocking grin.
05135	“To guard the king’s life, you surrender your own.
05136	You give up your lands and titles, give up hope of marriage, children.
05137	” “House Tyrell continues through my brothers,” Ser Loras said.
05138	“It is not necessary for a third son to wed, or breed.
05139	” “Not necessary, but some find it pleasant.
05140	What of love?” “When the sun has set, no candle can replace it.
05141	” “Is that from a song?” Tyrion cocked his head, smiling.
05142	“Yes, you are seventeen, I see that now.
05143	” Ser Loras tensed.
05144	“Do you mock me?” A prickly lad.
05145	“No.
05146	If I’ve given offense, forgive me.
05147	I had my own love once, and we had a song as well.
05148	”I loved a maid as fair as summer, with sunlight in her hair.
05149	He bid Ser Loras a good evening and went on his way.
05150	Near the kennels a group of men-at-arms were fighting a pair of dogs.
05151	Tyrion stopped long enough to see the smaller dog tear half the face off the larger one, and earned a few coarse laughs by observing that the loser now resembled Sandor Clegane.
05152	Then, hoping he had disarmed their suspicions, he proceeded to the north wall and down the short flight of steps to the eunuch’s meager abode.
05153	The door opened as he was lifting his hand to knock.
05154	“Varys?” Tyrion slipped inside.
05155	“Are you there?” A single candle lit the gloom, spicing the air with the scent of jasmine.
05156	“My lord.
05157	” A woman sidled into the light:: plump, soft, matronly, with a round pink moon of a face and heavy dark curls.
05158	Tyrion recoiled.
05159	“Is something amiss?” she asked.
05160	Varys, he realized with annoyance.
05161	“For one horrid moment I thought you’d brought me Lollys instead of Shae.

05165	html “Here, m’lord.
05166	” She put her hands over his eyes from behind.
05167	“Can you guess what I’m wearing?” “Nothing?” “Oh, you’re sosmart ,” she pouted, snatching her hands away.
05168	“How did you know?” “You’re very beautiful in nothing.
05169	” “Am I?” she said.
05170	“Am I truly?” “Oh yes.
05171	” “Then shouldn’t you be fucking me instead of talking?” “We need to rid ourselves of Lady Varys first.
05172	I am not the sort of dwarf who likes an audience.
05173	” “He’s gone,” Shae said.
05174	Tyrion turned to look.
05175	It was true.
05176	The eunuch had vanished, skirts and all.
05177	The hidden doors are here somewhere, they have to be.
05178	That was as much as he had time to think, before Shae turned his head to kiss him.
05179	Her mouth was wet and hungry, and she did not even seem to see his scar, or the raw scab where his nose had been.
05180	Her skin was warm silk beneath his fingers.
05181	When his thumb brushed against her left nipple, it hardened at once.
05182	“Hurry,” she urged, between kisses, as his fingers went to his laces, “oh, hurry, hurry, I want you in me, in me, in me.
05183	” He did not even have time to undress properly.
05184	Shae pulled his cock out of his breeches, then pushed him down onto the floor and climbed atop him.
05185	She screamed as he pushed past her lips, and rode him wildly, moaning, “My giant, my giant, my giant,” every time she slammed down on him.
05186	Tyrion was so eager that he exploded on the fifth stroke, but Shae did not seem to mind.
05187	She smiled wickedly when she felt him spurting, and leaned forward to kiss the sweat from his brow.
05188	“My giant of Lannister,” she murmured.
05189	“Stay inside me, please.
05190	I like to feel you there.
05191	” So Tyrion did not move, except to put his arms around her.
05192	It feels so good to hold her, and to be held , he thought.
05193	How can something this sweet be a crime worth hanging her for? “Shae,” he said, “sweetling, this must be our last time together.
05194	The danger is too great.
05195	If my lord father should find you.
05196	” “I like your scar.
05197	” She traced it with her finger.
05198	“It makes you look very fierce and strong.
05199	” He laughed.
05200	“Very ugly, you mean.
05201	” “M’lord will never be ugly in my eyes.
05202	” She kissed the scab that covered the ragged stub of his nose.
05203	“It’s not my face that need concern you, it’s my father—” “He does not frighten me.
05204	Will m’lord give me back my jewels and silks now? I asked Varys if I could have them when you were hurt in the battle, but he wouldn’t give them to me.
05205	What would have become of them if you’d died?” “I didn’t die.
05206	Here I am.
05207	” “I know.
05208	” Shae wriggled atop him, smiling.
05209	“Just where you belong.

05215	“You can stay with Lollys if you like, but it would be best if you left the city.
05216	” “I don’t want to leave.
05217	You promised you’d move me into a manse again after the battle.
05218	” Her cunt gave him a little squeeze, and he started to stiffen again inside her.
05219	“A Lannister always pays his debts, you said.
05220	” “Shae, gods be damned, stop that.
05221	Listen to me.
05222	You have to go away.
05223	The city’s full of Tyrells just now, and I am closely watched.
05224	You don’t understand the dangers.
05225	” “Can I come to the king’s wedding feast? Lollys won’t go.
05226	I told her no one’s like to rape her in the king’s own throne room, but she’s sostupid.
05227	” When Shae rolled off, his cock slid out of her with a soft wet sound.
05228	“Symon says there’s to be a singers’ tourney, and tumblers, even a fools’ joust.
05229	” Tyrion had almost forgotten about Shae’s thrice-damned singer.
05230	“How is it you spoke to Symon?” “I told Lady Tanda about him, and she hired him to play for Lollys.
05231	The music calms her when the baby starts to kick.
05232	Symon says there’s to be a dancing bear at the feast, and wines from the Arbor.
05233	I’ve never seen a bear dance.
05234	” “They do it worse than I do.
05235	” It was the singer who concerned him, not the bear.
05236	One careless word in the wrong ear, and Shae would hang.
05237	“Symon says there’s to be seventy-seven courses and a hundred doves baked into a great pie,” Shae gushed.
05238	“When the crust’s opened, they’ll all burst out and fly.
05239	” “After which they will roost in the rafters and rain down birdshit on the guests.
05240	” Tyrion had suffered such wedding pies before.
05241	The doves liked to shit onhim especially, or so he had always suspected.
05242	“Couldn’t I dress in my silks and velvets and go as a lady instead of a maidservant? No one would know I wasn’t.
05243	” Everyone would know you weren’t, thought Tyrion.
05244	“Lady Tanda might wonder where Lollys’s bedmaid found so many jewels.
05245	” “There’s to be a thousand guests, Symon says.
05246	She’d never even see me.
05247	I’d find a place in some dark corner below the salt, but whenever you got up to go to the privy I could slip out and meet you.
05248	” She cupped his cock and stroked it gently.
05249	“I won’t wear any smallclothes under my gown, so m’lord won’t even need to unlace me.
05250	” Her fingers teased him, up and down.
05251	“Or if he liked, I could do this for him.
05252	” She took him in her mouth.
05253	Tyrion was soon ready again.
05254	This time he lasted much longer.
05255	When he finished Shae crawled back up him and curled up naked under his arm.
05256	“You’ll let me come, won’t you?” “Shae,” he groaned, “it is not safe.
05257	” For a time she said nothing at all.
05258	Tyrion tried to speak of other things, but he met a wall of sullen courtesy as icy and unyielding as the Wall he’d once walked in the north.

05263	Had the choice been his, she could have sat beside him at Joffrey’s wedding feast, and danced with all the bears she liked.
05264	But he could not see her hang.
05265	When the candle burned out, Tyrion disentangled himself and lit another.
05266	Then he made a round of the walls, tapping on each in turn, searching for the hidden door.
05267	Shae sat with her legs drawn up and her arms wrapped around them, watching him.
05268	Finally she said, “They’re under the bed.
05269	The secret steps.
05270	” He looked at her, incredulous.
05271	“The bed? The bed is solid stone.
05272	It weighs half a ton.
05273	” “There’s a place where Varys pushes, and it floats right up.
05274	I asked him how, and he said it was magic.
05275	” “Yes.
05276	” Tyrion had to grin.
05277	“A counterweight spell.
05278	” Shae stood.
05279	“I should go back.
05280	Sometimes the baby kicks and Lollys wakes and calls for me.
05281	” “Varys should return shortly.
05282	He’s probably listening to every word we say.
05283	” Tyrion set the candle down.
05284	There was a wet spot on the front of his breeches but in the darkness it ought to go unnoticed.
05285	He told Shae to dress and wait for the eunuch.
05286	“I will,” she promised.
05287	“You are my lion, aren’t you? My giant of Lannister?” “I am,” he said.
05288	“And you’re—” “—your whore.
05289	” She laid a finger to his lips.
05290	“I know.
05291	I’d be your lady, but I never can.
05292	Else you’d take me to the feast.
05293	It doesn’t matter.
05294	I like being a whore for you, Tyrion.
05295	Just keep me, my lion, and keep me safe.
05296	” “I shall,” he promised.
05297	Fool, fool , the voice inside him screamed.
05298	Why did you say that? You came here to send her away! Instead he kissed her once more.
05299	The walk back seemed long and lonely.
05300	Podrick Payne was asleep in his trundle bed at the foot of Tyrion’s, but he woke the boy.
05301	“Bronn,” he said.
05302	“Ser Bronn?” Pod rubbed the sleep from his eyes.
05303	“Oh.
05304	Should I get him? My lord?” “Why no, I woke you up so we could have a little chat about the way he dresses,” said Tyrion, but his sarcasm was wasted.
05305	Pod only gaped at him in confusion until he threw up his hands and said, “Yes, get him.
05306	Bring him.
05307	Now.
05308	” The lad dressed hurriedly and all but ran from the room.
05309	Am I really so terrifying? Tyrion wondered, as he changed into a bedrobe and poured himself some wine.
05310	He was on his third cup and half the night was gone before Pod finally returned, with the sellsword knight in tow.
05311	“I hope the boy had a damn good reason dragging me out of Chataya’s,” Bronn said as he seated himself.
05312	“Chataya’s?” Tyrion said, annoyed.
05313	“It’s good to be a knight.
05314	No more looking for the cheaper brothels down the street.
05315	” Bronn grinned.

05319	html “Now it’s Alayaya and Marei in the same featherbed, with Ser Bronn in the middle.
05320	” Tyrion had to bite back his annoyance.
05321	Bronn had as much right to bed Alayaya as any other man, but still.
05322	I never touched her, much as I wanted to, but Bronn could not know that.
05323	He should have kept his cock out of her.
05324	He dare not visit Chataya’s himself.
05325	If he did, Cersei would see that his father heard of it, and ’Yaya would suffer more than a whipping.
05326	He’d sent the girl a necklace of silver and jade and a pair of matching bracelets by way of apology, but other than that.
05327	This is fruitless.
05328	“There is a singer who calls himself Symon Silver Tongue,” Tyrion said wearily, pushing his guilt aside.
05329	“He plays for Lady Tanda’s daughter sometimes.
05330	” “What of him?” Kill him, he might have said, but the man had done nothing but sing a few songs.
05331	And fill Shae’s sweet head with visions of doves and dancing bears.
05332	“Find him,” he said instead.
05333	“Find him before someone else does.
05334	” Chapter Thirteen Arya She was grubbing for vegetables in a dead man’s garden when she heard the singing.
05335	Arya stiffened, still as stone, listening, the three stringy carrots in her hand suddenly forgotten.
05336	She thought of the Bloody Mummers and Roose Bolton’s men, and a shiver of fear went down her back.
05337	It’s not fair, not when we finally found the Trident, not when we thought we were almost safe.
05338	Only why would the Mummers be singing? The song came drifting up the river from somewhere beyond the little rise to the east.
05339	“Off to Gulltown to see the fair maid, heigh-ho, heigh-ho.
05340	” Arya rose, carrots dangling from her hand.
05341	It sounded like the singer was coming up the river road.
05342	Over among the cabbages, Hot Pie had heard it too, to judge by the look on his face.
05343	Gendry had gone to sleep in the shade of the burned cottage, and was past hearing anything.
05344	“I’ll steal a sweet kiss with the point of my blade, heigh-ho, heigh-ho.
05345	” She thought she heard a woodharp too, beneath the soft rush of the river.
05346	“Do you hear?” Hot Pie asked in a hoarse whisper, as he hugged an armful of cabbages.
05347	“Someone’s coming.
05348	” “Go wake Gendry,” Arya told him.
05349	“Just shake him by the shoulder, don’t make a lot of noise.
05350	” Gendry was easy to wake, unlike Hot Pie, who needed to be kicked and shouted at.
05351	“I’ll make her my love and we’ll rest in the shade, heigh-ho, heigh-ho.
05352	” The song swelled louder with every word.
05353	Hot Pie opened his arms.
05354	The cabbages fell to the ground with soft thumps.
05355	“We have tohide.
05356	” Where?The burned cottage and its overgrown garden stood hard beside the banks of the Trident.
05357	There were a few willows growing along the river’s edge and reed beds in the muddy shallows beyond, but Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.

05360	html most of the ground hereabouts was painfully open.
05361	I knew we should never have left the woods , she thought.
05362	They’d been so hungry, though, and the garden had been too much a temptation.
05363	The bread and cheese they had stolen from Harrenhal had given out six days ago, back in the thick of the woods.
05364	“Take Gendry and the horses behind the cottage,” she decided.
05365	There was part of one wall still standing, big enough, maybe, to conceal two boys and three horses.
05366	If the horses don’t whinny, and that singer doesn’t come poking around the garden.
05367	“What about you?” “I’ll hide by the tree.
05368	He’s probably alone.
05369	If he bothers me, I’ll kill him.
05370	Go! ” Hot Pie went, and Arya dropped her carrots and drew the stolen sword from over her shoulder.
05371	She had strapped the sheath across her back:: the longsword was made for a man grown, and it bumped against the ground when she wore it on her hip.
05372	It’s too heavy besides , she thought, missing Needle the way she did every time she took this clumsy thing in her hand.
05373	But it was a sword and she could kill with it, that was enough.
05374	Lightfoot, she moved to the big old willow that grew beside the bend in the road and went to one knee in the grass and mud, within the veil of trailing branches.
05375	You old gods , she prayed as the singer’s voice grew louder,you tree gods, hide me, and make him go past.
05376	Then a horse whickered, and the song broke off suddenly.
05377	He’s heard , she knew,but maybe he’s alone, or if he’s not, maybe they’ll be as scared of us as we are of them.
05378	“Did you hear that?” a man’s voice said.
05379	“There’s something behind that wall, I would say.
05380	” “Aye,” replied a second voice, deeper.
05381	“What do you think it might be, Archer?” Two, then.
05382	Arya bit her lip.
05383	She could not see them from where she knelt, on account of the willow.
05384	But she could hear.
05385	“A bear.
05386	” A third voice, or the first one again? “A lot of meat on a bear,” the deep voice said.
05387	“A lot of fat as well, in fall.
05388	Good to eat, if it’s cooked up right.
05389	” “Could be a wolf.
05390	Maybe a lion.
05391	” “With four feet, you think? Or two?” “Makes no matter.
05392	Does it?” “Not so I know.
05393	Archer, what do you mean to do with all them arrows?” “Drop a few shafts over the wall.
05394	Whatever’s hiding back there will come out quick enough, watch and see.
05395	” “What if it’s some honest man back there, though? Or some poor woman with a little babe at her breast?” “An honest man would come out and show us his face.

05401	Go on and loose your shafts, then.
05402	” Arya sprang to her feet.
05403	“Don’t!” She showed them her sword.
05404	There were three, she saw.
05405	Only three.
05406	Syrio could fight more than three, and she had Hot Pie and Gendry to stand with her, maybe.
05407	But they’re boys, and these are men.
05408	They were men afoot, travel-stained and mud-specked.
05409	She knew the singer by the woodharp he cradled against his jerkin, as a mother might cradle a babe.
05410	A small man, fifty from the look of him, he had a big mouth, a sharp nose, and thinning brown hair.
05411	His faded greens were mended here and there with old leather patches, and he wore a brace of throwing knives on his hip and a woodman’s axe slung across his back.
05412	The man beside him stood a good foot taller, and had the look of a soldier.
05413	A longsword and dirk hung from his studded leather belt, rows of overlapping steel rings were sewn onto his shirt, and his head was covered by a black iron halfhelm shaped like a cone.
05414	He had bad teeth and a bushy brown beard, but it was his hooded yellow cloak that drew the eye.
05415	Thick and heavy, stained here with grass and there with blood, frayed along the bottom and patched with deerskin on the right shoulder, the greatcloak gave the big man the look of some huge yellow bird.
05416	The last of the three was a youth as skinny as his longbow, if not quite as tall.
05417	Red-haired and freckled, he wore a studded brigantine, high boots, fingerless leather gloves, and a quiver on his back.
05418	His arrows were fletched with grey goose feathers, and six of them stood in the ground before him, like a little fence.
05419	The three men looked at her, standing there in the road with her blade in hand.
05420	Then the singer idly plucked a string.
05421	“Boy,” he said, “put up that sword now, unless you’re wanting to be hurt.
05422	It’s too big for you, lad, and besides, Anguy here could put three shafts through you before you could hope to reach us.
05423	” “He could not,” Arya said, “and I’m agirl.
05424	” “So you are.
05425	” The singer bowed.
05426	“My pardons.
05427	” “You go on down the road.
05428	Just walk right past here, and you keep on singing, so we’ll know where you are.
05429	Go away and leave us be and I won’t kill you.
05430	” The freckle-faced archer laughed.
05431	“Lem, she won’t kill us, did you hear?” “I heard,” said Lem, the big soldier with the deep voice.
05432	“Child,” said the singer, “put up that sword, and we’ll take you to a safe place and get some food in that belly.
05433	There are wolves in these parts, and lions, and worse things.
05434	No place for a little girl to be wandering alone.
05435	” “She’s not alone.
05436	” Gendry rode out from behind the cottage wall, and behind him Hot Pie, leading her horse.
05437	In his chainmail shirt with a sword in his hand, Gendry looked almost a man grown, and dangerous.
05438	Hot Pie looked like Hot Pie.
05439	“Do like she says, and leave us be,” warned Gendry.
05440	“Two and three,” the singer counted, “and is that all of you? And horses too, lovely horses.
05441	Where did you steal them?” “They’re ours.
05442	” Arya watched them carefully.

05447	If he should pull an arrow from the ground.
05448	“Will you give us your names like honest men?” the singer asked the boys.
05449	“I’m Hot Pie,” Hot Pie said at once.
05450	“Aye, and good for you.
05451	” The man smiled.
05452	“It’s not every day I meet a lad with such a tasty name.
05453	And what would your friends be called, Mutton Chop and Squab?” Gendry scowled down from his saddle.
05454	“Why should I tell you my name? I haven’t heard yours.
05455	” “Well, as to that, I’m Tom of Sevenstreams, but Tom Sevenstrings is what they call me, or Tom o’ Sevens.
05456	This great lout with the brown teeth is Lem, short for Lemoncloak.
05457	It’s yellow, you see, and Lem’s a sour sort.
05458	And young fellow me lad over there is Anguy, or Archer as we like to call him.
05459	” “Now who are you?” demanded Lem, in the deep voice that Arya had heard through the branches of the willow.
05460	She was not about to give up her true name as easy as that.
05461	“Squab, if you want,” she said.
05462	“I don’t care.
05463	” The big man laughed.
05464	“A squab with a sword,” he said.
05465	“Now there’s something you don’t often see.
05466	” “I’m the Bull,” said Gendry, taking his lead from Arya.
05467	She could not blame him for preferring Bull to Mutton Chop.
05468	Tom Sevenstrings strummed his harp.
05469	“Hot Pie, Squab, and the Bull.
05470	Escaped from Lord Bolton’s kitchen, did you?” “How did you know?” Arya demanded, uneasy.
05471	“You bear his sigil on your chest, little one.
05472	” She had forgotten that for an instant.
05473	Beneath her cloak, she still wore her fine page’s doublet, with the flayed man of the Dreadfort sewn on her breast.
05474	“Don’t call me little one!” “Why not?” said Lem.
05475	“You’re little enough.
05476	” “I’m bigger than I was.
05477	I’m not achild.
05478	” Children didn’t kill people, and she had.
05479	“I can see that, Squab.
05480	You’re none of you children, not if you wereBolton ’s.
05481	” “We never were.
05482	” Hot Pie never knew when to keep quiet.
05483	“We were at Harrenhal before he came, that’s all.
05484	” “So you’re lion cubs, is that the way of it?” said Tom.
05485	“Not that either.
05486	We’re nobody’s men.

05492	“Which king?” “King Robert,” said Lem, in his yellow cloak.
05493	“That old drunk?” said Gendry scornfully.
05494	“He’s dead, some boar killed him, everyone knows that.
05495	” “Aye, lad,” said Tom Sevenstrings, “and more’s the pity.
05496	” He plucked a sad chord from his harp.
05497	Arya didn’t think they were king’s men at all.
05498	They looked more like outlaws, all tattered and ragged.
05499	They didn’t even have horses to ride.
05500	King’s men would have had horses.
05501	But Hot Pie piped up eagerly.
05502	“We’re looking for Riverrun,” he said.
05503	“How many days’ ride is it, do you know?” Arya could have killed him.
05504	“You be quiet, or I’ll stuff rocks in your big stupid mouth,” “Riverrun is a long way upstream,” said Tom.
05505	“A long hungry way.
05506	Might be you’d like a hot meal before you set out? There’s an inn not far ahead kept by some friends of ours.
05507	We could share some ale and a bite of bread, instead of fighting one another.
05508	” “An inn?” The thought of hot food made Arya’s belly rumble, but she didn’t trust this Tom.
05509	Not everyone who spoke you friendly was really your friend.
05510	“It’s near, you say?” “Two miles upstream,” said Tom.
05511	“A league at most.
05512	” Gendry looked as uncertain as she felt.
05513	“What do you mean,friends? ” he asked warily.
05514	“Friends.
05515	Have you forgotten what friends are?” “Sharna is the innkeep’s name,” Tom put in.
05516	“She has a sharp tongue and a fierce eye, I’ll grant you that, but her heart’s a good one, and she’s fond of little girls.
05517	” “I’m not a little girl,” she said angrily.
05518	“Who else is there? You saidfriends ” “Sharna’s husband, and an orphan boy they took in.
05519	They won’t harm you.
05520	There’s ale, if you think you’re old enough.
05521	Fresh bread and maybe a bit of meat.
05522	” Tom glanced toward the cottage.
05523	“And whatever you stole from Old Pate’s garden besides.
05524	” “We never stole,” said Arya.
05525	“Are you Old Pate’s daughter, then? A sister? A wife? Tell me no lies, Squab.
05526	I buried Old Pate myself, right there under that willow where you were hiding, and you don’t have his look.
05527	” He drew a sad sound from his harp.
05528	“We’ve buried many a good man this past year, but we’ve no wish to bury you, I swear it on my harp.
05529	Archer, show her.
05530	” The archer’s hand moved quicker than Arya would have believed.
05531	His shaft went hissing past her head within an inch of her ear and buried itself in the trunk of the willow behind her.
05532	By then the bowman had a second arrow notched and drawn.
05533	She’d thought she understood what Syrio meant byquick as a snake andsmooth as summer silk , but now she knew she hadn’t.
05534	The arrow thrummed behind her like a bee.

05540	“They go where I send them.
05541	” “That they do,” agreed Lem Lemoncloak.
05542	There were a dozen steps between the archer and the point of her sword.
05543	We have no chance , Arya realized, wishing she had a bow like his, and the skill to use it.
05544	Glumly, she lowered her heavy longsword till the point touched the ground.
05545	“We’ll come see this inn,” she conceded, trying to hide the doubt in her heart behind bold words.
05546	“You walk in front and we’ll ride behind, so we can see what you’re doing.
05547	” Tom Sevenstrings bowed deeply and said, “Before, behind, it makes no matter.
05548	Come along, lads, let’s show them the way.
05549	Anguy, best pull up those arrows, we won’t be needing them here.
05550	” Arya sheathed her sword and crossed the road to where her friends sat on their horses, keeping her distance from the three strangers.
05551	“Hot Pie, get those cabbages,” she said as she vaulted into her saddle.
05552	“And the carrots too.
05553	” For once he did not argue.
05554	They set off as she had wanted, walking their horses slowly down the rutted road a dozen paces behind the three on foot.
05555	But before very long, somehow they were riding right on top of them.
05556	Tom Sevenstrings walked slowly, and liked to strum his woodharp as he went.
05557	“Do you know any songs?” he asked them.
05558	“I’d dearly love someone to sing with, that I would.
05559	Lem can’t carry a tune, and our longbow lad only knows marcher ballads, every one of them a hundred verses long.
05560	” “We sing real songs in the marches,” Anguy said mildly.
05561	“Singing isstupid ,” said Arya.
05562	“Singing makes noise.
05563	We heard you a long way off.
05564	We could have killed you.
05565	” Tom’s smile said he did not think so.
05566	“There are worse things than dying with a song on your lips.
05567	” “If there were wolves hereabouts, we’d know it,” groused Lem.
05568	“Or lions.
05569	These are our woods.
05570	” “You never knew we were there,” said Gendry.
05571	“Now, lad, you shouldn’t be so certain of that,” said Tom.
05572	“Sometimes a man knows more than he says.
05573	” Hot Pie shifted his seat.
05574	“I know the song about the bear,” he said.
05575	“Some of it, anyhow.
05576	” Tom ran his fingers down his strings.
05577	“Then let’s hear it, pie boy.
05578	” He threw back his head and sang, “A bear there was, a bear, a bear! All black and brown, and covered with hair.
05579	” Hot Pie joined in lustily, even bouncing in his saddle a little on the rhymes.
05580	Arya stared at him in astonishment.
05581	He had a good voice and he sang well.
05582	He never did anything well, except bake , she thought to herself.
05583	A small brook flowed into the Trident a little farther on.
05584	As they waded across, their singing flushed a duck from among the reeds.
05585	Anguy stopped where he stood, unslung his bow, notched an arrow, and brought it down.
05586	The bird fell in the shallows not far from the bank.
05587	Lem took off his yellow cloak and waded in knee-deep to retrieve it, complaining all the while.
05588	“Do you think Sharna might have lemons down in that cellar of hers?” said Anguy to Tom as they watched Lem splash around, cursing.
05589	“A Dornish girl once cooked me duck with lemons.
05590	” He sounded wistful.

05594	html Tom and Hot Pie resumed their song on the other side of the brook, with the duck hanging from Lem’s belt beneath his yellow cloak.
05595	Somehow the singing made the miles seem shorter.
05596	It was not very long at all until the inn appeared before them, rising from the riverbank where the Trident made a great bend to the north.
05597	Arya squinted at it suspiciously as they neared.
05598	It did not look like an outlaws’ lair, she had to admit:: it looked friendly, even homey, with its whitewashed upper story and slate roof and the smoke curling up lazy from its chimney.
05599	Stables and other outbuildings surrounded it, and there was an arbor in back, and apple trees, a small garden.
05600	The inn even had its own dock, thrusting out into the river, and.
05601	“Gendry,” she called, her voice low and urgent.
05602	“They have a boat.
05603	We could sail the rest of the way up to Riverrun.
05604	It would be faster than riding, I think.
05605	” He looked dubious.
05606	“Did you ever sail a boat?” “You put up the sail,” she said, “and the wind pushes it.
05607	” “What if the wind is blowing the wrong way?” “Then there’s oars to row.
05608	” “Against the current?” Gendry frowned.
05609	“Wouldn’t that be slow? And what if the boat tips over and we fall into the water? It’s not our boat anyway, it’s the inn’s.
05610	” We could take it.
05611	Arya chewed her lip and said nothing.
05612	They dismounted in front of stables.
05613	There were no other horses to be seen, but Arya noticed fresh manure in many of the stalls.
05614	“One of us should watch the horses,” she said, wary.
05615	Tom overheard her.
05616	“There’s no need for that, Squab.
05617	Come eat, they’ll be safe enough.
05618	” “I’ll stay,” Gendry said, ignoring the singer.
05619	“You can come get me after you’ve had some food.
05620	” Nodding, Arya set off after Hot Pie and Lem.
05621	Her sword was still in its sheath across her back, and she kept a hand close to the hilt of the dagger she had stolen from Roose Bolton, in case she didn’t like whatever they found within.
05622	The painted sign above the door showed a picture of some old king on his knees.
05623	Inside was the common room, where a very tall ugly woman with a knobby chin stood with her hands on her hips, glaring.
05624	“Don’t just stand there, boy,” she snapped.
05625	“Or are you a girl? Either one, you’re blocking my door.
05626	Get in or get out.
05627	Lem, what did I tell you about my floor? You’re all mud.
05628	” “We shot a duck.
05629	” Lem held it out like a peace banner.
05630	The woman snatched it from his hand.
05631	“Anguy shot a duck, is what you’re meaning.
05632	Get your boots off, are you deaf or just stupid?” She turned away.
05633	“Husband!” she called loudly.
05634	“Get up here, the lads are back.
05635	Husband! ” Up the cellar steps came a man in a stained apron, grumbling.
05636	He was a head shorter than the woman, with a lumpy face and loose yellowish skin that still showed the marks of some pox.
05637	“I’m here, woman, quit your bellowing.

05641	html “Hang this,” she said, handing him the duck.
05642	Anguy shuffled his feet.
05643	“We were thinking we might eat it, Sharna.
05644	With lemons.
05645	If you had some.
05646	” “Lemons.
05647	And where would we get lemons? Does this look like Dorne to you, you freckled fool? Why don’t you hop out back to the lemon trees and pick us a bushel, and some nice olives and pomegranates too.
05648	” She shook a finger at him.
05649	“Now, I suppose I could cook it with Lem’s cloak, if you like, but not till it’s hung for a few days.
05650	You’ll eat rabbit, or you won’t eat.
05651	Roast rabbit on a spit would be quickest, if you’ve got a hunger.
05652	Or might be you’d like it stewed, with ale and onions.
05653	” Arya could almost taste the rabbit.
05654	“We have no coin, but we brought some carrots and cabbages we could trade you.
05655	” “Did you now? And where would they be?” “Hot Pie, give her the cabbages,” Arya said, and he did, though he approached the old woman as gingerly as if she were Rorge or Biter or Vargo Hoat.
05656	The woman gave the vegetables a close inspection, and the boy a closer one.
05657	“Where is thishot pie ?” “Here.
05658	Me.
05659	It’s my name.
05660	And she’s.
05661	ah.
05662	Squab.
05663	” “Not under my roof.
05664	I give my diners and my dishes different names, so as to tell them apart.
05665	Husband! ” Husband had stepped outside, but at her shout he hurried back.
05666	“The duck’s hung.
05667	What is it now, woman?” “Wash these vegetables,” she commanded.
05668	“The rest of you, sit down while I start the rabbits.
05669	The boy will bring you drink.
05670	” She looked down her long nose at Arya and Hot Pie.
05671	“I am not in the habit of serving ale to children, but the cider’s run out, there’s no cows for milk, and the river water tastes of war, with all the dead men drifting downstream.
05672	If I served you a cup of soup full of dead flies, would you drink it?” “Arry would,” said Hot Pie.
05673	“I mean, Squab.
05674	” “So would Lem,” offered Anguy with a sly smile.
05675	“Never you mind about Lem,” Sharna said.
05676	“It’s ale for all.
05677	” She swept off toward the kitchen.
05678	Anguy and Tom Sevenstrings took the table near the hearth while Lem was hanging his big yellow cloak on a peg.
05679	Hot Pie plopped down heavily on a bench at the table by the door, and Arya wedged herself in beside him.
05680	Tom unslung his harp.
05681	“A lonely inn on a forest road,” he sang, slowly picking out a tune to go with the words.
05682	“The innkeep’s wife was plain as a toad.
05683	” “Shut up with that now or we won’t be getting no rabbit,” Lem warned him.
05684	“You know how she is.
05685	” Arya leaned close to Hot Pie.
05686	“Can you sail a boat?” she asked.
05687	Before he could answer, a thickset boy of fifteen or sixteen appeared with tankards of ale.
05688	Hot Pie took his reverently in both hands, and when he sipped he smiled wider than Arya had ever seen him smile.
05689	“Ale,” he whispered, “andrabbit.

05693	html “Well, here’s to His Grace,” Anguy the Archer called out cheerfully, lifting a toast.
05694	“Seven save the king!” “All twelve o’them,” Lem Lemoncloak muttered.
05695	He drank, and wiped the foam from his mouth with the back of his hand.
05696	Husband came bustling in through the front door, with an apron full of washed vegetables.
05697	“There’s strange horses in the stable,” he announced, as if they hadn’t known.
05698	“Aye,” said Tom, setting the woodharp aside, “and better horses than the three you gave away.
05699	” Husband dropped the vegetables on a table, annoyed.
05700	“I never gave them away.
05701	Isold them for a good price, and got us a skiff as well.
05702	Anyways, you lot were supposed to get them back.
05703	” I knew they were outlaws, Arya thought, listening.
05704	Her hand went under the table to touch the hilt of her dagger, and make sure it was still there.
05705	If they try to rob us, they’ll be sorry.
05706	“They never came our way,” said Lem.
05707	“Well, I sent them.
05708	You must have been drunk, or asleep.
05709	” “Us? Drunk?” Tom drank a long draught of ale.
05710	“Never.
05711	” “You could have taken them yourself,” Lem told Husband.
05712	“What, with only the boy here? I told you twice, the old woman was up to Lambswold helping that Fern birth her babe.
05713	And like as not it was one o’ you planted the bastard in the poor girl’s belly.
05714	” He gave Tom a sour look.
05715	“You, I’d wager, with that harp o’ yours, singing all them sad songs just to get poor Fern out of her smallclothes.
05716	” “If a song makes a maid want to slip off her clothes and feel the good warm sun kiss her skin, why, is that the singer’s fault?” asked Tom.
05717	“And ’twas Anguy she fancied, besides.
05718	‘Can I touch your bow?’ I heard her ask him.
05719	‘Ooohh, it feels so smooth and hard.
05720	Could I give it a little pull, do you think?’ ” Husband snorted.
05721	“You and Anguy, makes no matter which.
05722	You’re as much to blame as me for them horses.
05723	They was three, you know.
05724	What can one man do against three?” “Three,” said Lem scornfully, “but one a woman and t’other in chains, you said so yourself.
05725	” Husband made a face.
05726	“Abig woman, dressed like a man.
05727	And the one in chains.
05728	I didn’t fancy the look of his eyes.
05729	” Anguy smiled over his ale.
05730	“When I don’t fancy a man’s eyes, I put an arrow through one.
05731	” Arya remembered the shaft that had brushed by her ear.
05732	She wished she knew how to shoot arrows.
05733	Husband was not impressed.
05734	“You be quiet when your elders are talking.
05735	Drink your ale and mind your tongue, or I’ll have the old woman take a spoon to you.
05736	” “My elders talk too much, and I don’t need you to tell me to drink my ale.

05740	html show that it was so.
05741	Arya did the same.
05742	After days of drinking from brooks and puddles, and then the muddy Trident, the ale tasted as good as the little sips of wine her father used to allow her.
05743	A smell was drifting out from the kitchen that made her mouth water, but her thoughts were still full of that boat.
05744	Sailing it will be harder than stealing it.
05745	If we wait until they’re all asleep.
05746	The serving boy reappeared with big round loaves of bread.
05747	Arya broke off a chunk hungrily and tore into it.
05748	It was hard to chew, though, sort of thick and lumpy, and burned on the bottom.
05749	Hot Pie made a face as soon as he tasted it.
05750	“That’s bad bread,” he said.
05751	“It’s burned, and tough besides.
05752	” “It’s better when there’s stew to sop up,” said Lem.
05753	“No, it isn’t,” said Anguy, “but you’re less like to break your teeth.
05754	” “You can eat it or go hungry,” said Husband.
05755	“Do I look like some bloody baker? I’d like to see you make better.
05756	” “I could,” said Hot Pie.
05757	“It’s easy.
05758	You kneaded the dough too much, that’s why it’s so hard to chew.
05759	” He took another sip of ale, and began talking lovingly of breads and pies and tarts, all the things he loved.
05760	Arya rolled her eyes.
05761	Tom sat down across from her.
05762	“Squab,” he said, “or Arry, or whatever your true name might be, this is for you.
05763	” He placed a dirty scrap of parchment on the wooden tabletop between them.
05764	She looked at it suspiciously.
05765	“What is it?” “Three golden dragons.
05766	We need to buy those horses.
05767	” Arya looked at him warily.
05768	“They’reour horses.
05769	” “Meaning you stole them yourselves, is that it? No shame in that, girl.
05770	War makes thieves of many honest folk.
05771	” Tom tapped the folded parchment with his finger.
05772	“I’m paying you a handsome price.
05773	More than any horse is worth, if truth be told.
05774	” Hot Pie grabbed the parchment and unfolded it.
05775	“There’s no gold,” he complained loudly.
05776	“It’s only writing.
05777	” “Aye,” said Tom, “and I’m sorry for that.
05778	But after the war, we mean to make that good, you have my word as a king’s man.
05779	” Arya pushed back from the table and got to her feet.
05780	“You’re no king’s men, you’re robbers.
05781	” “If you’d ever met a true robber, you’d know they do not pay, not even in paper.
05782	It’s not for us we take your horses, child, it’s for the good of the realm, so we can get about more quickly and fight the fights that need fighting.
05783	The king’s fights.
05784	Would you deny the king?” They were all watching her:: the Archer, big Lem, Husband with his sallow face and shifty eyes.
05785	Even Sharna, who stood in the door to the kitchen squinting.

05789	html what I say , she realized.
05790	We’ll need to walk to Riverrun, unless.
05791	“We don’t want paper.
05792	” Arya slapped the parchment out of Hot Pie’s hand.
05793	“You can have our horses for that boat outside.
05794	But only if you show us how to work it.
05795	” Tom Sevenstrings stared at her a moment, and then his wide homely mouth quirked into a rueful grin.
05796	He laughed aloud.
05797	Anguy joined in, and then they were all laughing, Lem Lemoncloak, Sharna and Husband, even the serving boy, who had stepped out from behind the casks with a crossbow under one arm.
05798	Arya wanted to scream at them, but instead she started to smile.
05799	“Riders!” Gendry’s shout was shrill with alarm.
05800	The door burst open and there he was.
05801	“Soldiers,” he panted.
05802	“Coming down the river road, a dozen of them.
05803	” Hot Pie leapt up, knocking over his tankard, but Tom and the others were unpertubed.
05804	“There’s no cause for spilling good ale on my floor,” said Sharna.
05805	“Sit back down and calm yourself, boy, there’s rabbit coming.
05806	You too, girl.
05807	Whatever harm’s been done you, it’s over and it’s done and you’re with king’s men now.
05808	We’ll keep you safe as best we can.
05809	” Arya’s only answer was to reach over her shoulder for her sword, but before she had it halfway drawn Lem grabbed her wrist.
05810	“We’ll have no more of that, now.
05811	” He twisted her arm until her hand opened.
05812	His fingers were hard with callus and fearsomely strong.
05813	Again! Arya thought.
05814	It’s happening again, like it happened in the village, with Chiswyck and Raff and the Mountain That Rides.
05815	They were going to steal her sword and turn her back into a mouse.
05816	Her free hand closed around her tankard, and she swung it at Lem’s face.
05817	The ale sloshed over the rim and splashed into his eyes, and she heard his nose break and saw the spurt of blood.
05818	When he roared his hands went to his face, and she was free.
05819	“Run!” she screamed, bolting.
05820	But Lem was on her again at once, with his long legs that made one of his steps equal to three of hers.
05821	She twisted and kicked, but he yanked her off her feet effortlessly and held her dangling while the blood ran down his face.
05822	“Stop it, you little fool,” he shouted, shaking her back and forth.
05823	“Stop it now!” Gendry moved to help her, until Tom Sevenstrings stepped in front of him with a dagger.
05824	By then it was too late to flee.
05825	She could hear horses outside, and the sound of men’s voices.
05826	A moment later a man came swaggering through the open door, a Tyroshi even bigger than Lem with a great thick beard, bright green at the ends but growing out grey.
05827	Behind came a pair of crossbowmen helping a wounded man between them, and then others.
05828	A more ragged band Arya had never seen, but there was nothing ragged about the swords, axes, and bows they carried.
05829	One or two gave her curious glances as they entered, but no one said a word.
05830	A one-eyed man in a rusty pothelm sniffed the air and grinned, while an archer with a head of stiff yellow hair was shouting for ale.
05831	After them came a spearman in a lioncrested helm, an older man with a limp, a Braavosi sellsword, a.
05832	“Harwin?” Arya whispered.
05833	It was! Under the beard and the tangled hair was the face of Hullen’s son, who used to lead her pony around the yard, ride at quintain with Jon and Robb, and drink too much on feast days.
05834	He was thinner, harder somehow, and at Winterfell he had never worn a beard, but it was him—her father’s man.
05835	“Harwin!” Squirming, she threw herself forward, trying to wrench free of Lem’s iron grip.
05836	“It’s me,” she shouted, “Harwin, it’s me, don’t you know me, don’t you?” The tears came, and she found herself weeping like a baby, just like some stupid little girl.

05840	html Harwin’s eyes went from her face to the flayed man on her doublet.
05841	“How do you know me?” he said, frowning suspiciously.
05842	“The flayed man.
05843	who are you, some serving boy to Lord Leech?” For a moment she did not know how to answer.
05844	She’d had so many names.
05845	Had she only dreamed Arya Stark? “I’m a girl,” she sniffed.
05846	“I was Lord Bolton’s cupbearer but he was going to leave me for the goat, so I ran off with Gendry and Hot Pie.
05847	Youhave to know me! You used to lead my pony, when I was little.
05848	” His eyes went wide.
05849	“Gods be good,” he said in a choked voice.
05850	“Arya Underfoot? Lem, let go of her.
05851	” “She broke my nose.
05852	” Lem dumped her unceremoniously to the floor.
05853	“Who in seven hells is she supposed to be?” “The Hand’s daughter.
05854	” Harwin went to one knee before her.
05855	“Arya Stark, of Winterfell.
05856	” Chapter Fourteen Catelyn Robb, she knew, the moment she heard the kennels erupt.
05857	Her son had returned to Riverrun, and Grey Wind with him.
05858	Only the scent of the great grey direwolf could send the hounds into such a frenzy of baying and barking.
05859	He will come to me , she knew.
05860	Edmure had not returned after his first visit, preferring to spend his days with Marq Piper and Patrek Mallister, listening to Rymund the Rhymer’s verses about the battle at the Stone Mill.
05861	Robb is not Edmure, though.
05862	Robb will see me.
05863	It had been raining for days now, a cold grey downpour that well suited Catelyn’s mood.
05864	Her father was growing weaker and more delirious with every passing day, waking only to mutter, “Tansy,” and beg forgiveness.
05865	Edmure shunned her, and Ser Desmond Grell still denied her freedom of the castle, however unhappy it seemed to make him.
05866	Only the return of Ser Robin Ryger and his men, footweary and drenched to the bone, served to lighten her spirits.
05867	They had walked back, it seemed.
05868	Somehow the Kingslayer had contrived to sink their galley and escape, Maester Vyman confided.
05869	Catelyn asked if she might speak with Ser Robin to learn more of what had happened, but that was refused her.
05870	Something else was wrong as well.
05871	On the day her brother returned, a few hours after their argument, she had heard angry voices from the yard below.
05872	When she climbed to the roof to see, there were knots of men gathered across the castle beside the main gate.
05873	Horses were being led from the stables, saddled and bridled, and there was shouting, though Catelyn was too far away to make out the words.
05874	One of Robb’s white banners lay on the ground, and one of the knights turned his horse and trampled over the direwolf as he spurred toward the gate.
05875	Several others did the same.
05876	Those are men who fought with Edmure on the fords , she thought.
05877	What could have made them so angry? Has my brother slighted them somehow, given them some insult? She thought she recognized Ser Perwyn Frey, who had traveled with her to Bitterbridge and Storm’s End and back, and his bastard half brother Martyn Rivers as well, but from this vantage it was hard to be certain.
05878	Close to forty men poured out through the castle gates, to what end she did not know.
05879	They did not come back.
05880	Nor would Maester Vyman tell her who they had been, where they had gone, or what had made them so angry.
05881	“I am here to see to your father, and only that, my lady,” he said.
05882	“Your brother will soon be Lord of Riverrun.
05883	What he wishes you to know, he must tell you.
05884	” But now Robb was returned from the west, returned in triumph.

05889	He must forgive me, he is my own son, and Arya and Sansa are as much his blood as mine.
05890	He will free me from these rooms and then I will know what has happened.
05891	By the time Ser Desmond came for her, she had bathed and dressed and combed out her auburn hair.
05892	“King Robb has returned from the west, my lady,” the knight said, “and commands that you attend him in the Great Hall.
05893	” It was the moment she had dreamt of and dreaded.
05894	Have I lost two sons, or three? She would know soon enough.
05895	The hall was crowded when they entered.
05896	Every eye was on the dais, but Catelyn knew their backs: Lady Mormont’s patched ringmail, the Greatjon and his son looming above every other head in the hall, Lord Jason Mallister white-haired with his winged helm in the crook of his arm, Tytos Blackwood in his magnificent raven-feather cloak.
05897	Half of them will want to hang me now.
05898	The other half may only turn their eyes away.
05899	She had the uneasy feeling that someone was missing, too.
05900	Robb stood on the dais.
05901	He is a boy no longer , she realized with a pang.
05902	He is sixteen now, a man grown.
05903	Just look at him.
05904	War had melted all the softness from his face and left him hard and lean.
05905	He had shaved his beard away, but his auburn hair fell uncut to his shoulders.
05906	The recent rains had rusted his mail and left brown stains on the white of his cloak and surcoat.
05907	Or perhaps the stains were blood.
05908	On his head was the sword crown they had fashioned him of bronze and iron.
05909	He bears it more comfortably now.
05910	He bears it like a king.

05914	Small wonder Lord Tywin ran off to fight Stannis.
05915	He’d had his fill of northmen and rivermen both.
05916	” That brought laughter and approving shouts, but Robb raised a hand for quiet.
05917	“Make no mistake, though.
05918	The Lannisters will march again, and there will be other battles to win before the kingdom is secure.
05919	” The Greatjon roared out, “King in the North!” and thrust a mailed fist into the air.
05920	The river lords answered with a shout of “King of the Trident!” The hall grew thunderous with pounding fists and stamping feet.
05921	Only a few noted Catelyn and Ser Desmond amidst the tumult, but they elbowed their fellows, and slowly a hush grew around her.
05922	She held her head high and ignored the eyes.
05923	Let them think what they will.
05924	It is Robb’s judgment that matters.
05925	The sight of Ser Brynden Tully’s craggy face on the dais gave her comfort.
05926	A boy she did not know seemed to be acting as Robb’s squire.
05927	Behind him stood a young knight in a sand-colored surcoat blazoned with seashells, and an older one who wore three black pepperpots on a saffron bend, across a field of green and silver stripes.
05928	Between them were a handsome older lady and a pretty maid who looked to be her daughter.
05929	There was another girl as well, near Sansa’s age.
05930	The seashells were the sigil of some lesser house, Catelyn knew:: the older man’s she did not recognize.
05931	Prisoners? Why would Robb bring captives onto the dais? Utherydes Wayn banged his staff on the floor as Ser Desmond escorted her forward.
05932	If Robb looks at me as Edmure did, I do not know what I will do.
05933	But it seemed to her that it was not anger she saw in her son’s eyes, but something else.
05934	apprehension, perhaps? No, that made no sense.
05935	What shouldhe fear? He was the Young Wolf, King of the Trident and the North.
05936	Her uncle was the first to greet her.

05941	He leapt off the dais and pulled Catelyn into his arms.
05942	When he said, “It is good to see you home, Cat,” she had to struggle to keep her composure.
05943	“And you,” she whispered.
05944	“Mother.
05945	” Catelyn looked up at her tall kingly son.
05946	“Your Grace, I have prayed for your safe return.
05947	I had heard you were wounded.
05948	” “I took an arrow through the arm while storming the Crag,” he said.
05949	“It’s healed well, though.
05950	I had the best of care.
05951	” “The gods are good, then.
05952	” Catelyn took a deep breath.
05953	Say it.
05954	It cannot be avoided.
05955	“They will have told you what I did.
05956	Did they tell you my reasons?” “For the girls.
05957	” “I had five children.
05958	Now I have three.
05959	” “Aye, my lady.
05960	” Lord Rickard Karstark pushed past the Greatjon, like some grim specter with his black mail and long ragged grey beard, his narrow face pinched and cold.
05961	“And I have one son, who once had three.
05962	You have robbed me of my vengeance.
05963	” Catelyn faced him calmly.
05964	“Lord Rickard, the Kingslayer’s dying would not have bought life for your children.
05965	His living may buy life for mine.
05966	” The lord was unappeased.
05967	“Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool.
05968	You’ve bought a bag of empty words, no more.
05969	My Torrhen and my Eddard deserved better of you.
05970	” “Leave off, Karstark,” rumbled the Greatjon, crossing his huge arms against his chest.
05971	“It was a mother’s folly.
05972	Women are made that way.
05973	” “A mother’s folly?” Lord Karstark rounded on Lord Umber.

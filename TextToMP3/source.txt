00077	And Haggon’s words had haunted him, and so the chance had passed.
00078	After the battle there had been thousands of them struggling through the forest, hungry, frightened, fleeing the carnage that had descended on them at the Wall.
00079	Some had talked of returning to the homes that they’d abandoned, others of mounting a second assault upon the gate, but most were lost, with no notion of where to go or what to do.
00080	They had escaped the black:cloaked crows and the knights in their grey steel, but more relentless enemies stalked them now.
00081	Every day left more corpses by the trails.
00082	Some died of hunger, some of cold, some of sickness.
00083	Others were slain by those who had been their brothers:in:arms when they marched south with Mance Rayder, the King:Beyond:the:Wall.
00084	Mance is fallen, the survivors told each other in despairing voices, Mance is taken, Mance is dead.
00085	“Harma’s dead and Mance is captured, the rest run off and left us,” Thistle had claimed, as she was sewing up his wound.
00086	“Tormund, the Weeper, Sixskins, all them brave raiders.
00087	Where are they now?” She does not know me, Varamyr realized then, and why should she? Without his beasts he did not look like a great man.
00088	I was Varamyr Six:skins, who broke bread with Mance Rayder.
00089	He had named himself Varamyr when he was ten.
00090	A name fit for a lord, a name for songs, a mighty name, and fearsome.
00091	Yet he had run from the crows like a frightened rabbit.
00092	The terrible Lord Varamyr had gone craven, but he could not bear that she should know that, so he told the spearwife that his name was Haggon.
00093	Afterward he wondered why that name had come to his lips, of all those he might have chosen.
00094	I ate his heart and drank his blood, and still he haunts me.
00095	One day, as they fled, a rider came galloping through the woods on a gaunt white horse, shouting that they all should make for the Milkwater, that the Weeper was gathering warriors to cross the Bridge of Skulls and take the Shadow Tower.
00096	Many followed him:: more did not.
00097	Later, a dour warrior in fur and amber went from cookfire to cookfire, urging all the survivors to head north and take refuge in the valley of the Thenns.
00098	Why he thought they would be safe there when the Thenns themselves had fled the place Varamyr never learned, but hundreds followed him.
00099	Hundreds more went off with the woods witch who’d had a vision of a fleet of ships coming to carry the free folk south.
00100	“We must seek the sea,” cried Mother Mole, and her followers turned east.
00101	Varamyr might have been amongst them if only he’d been stronger.
00102	The sea was grey and cold and far away, though, and he knew that he would never live to see it.
00103	He was nine times dead and dying, and this would be his true death.
00104	A squirrel:skin cloak, he remembered, he knifed me for a squirrel:skin cloak.
00105	Its owner had been dead, the back of her head smashed into red pulp flecked with bits of bone, but her cloak looked warm and thick.
00106	It was snowing, and Varamyr had lost his own cloaks at the Wall.
00107	His sleeping pelts and woolen smallclothes, his sheepskin boots and fur:lined gloves, his store of mead and hoarded food, the hanks of hair he took from the women he bedded, even the golden arm rings Mance had given him, all lost and left behind.
00108	I burned and I died and then I ran, half:mad with pain and terror.
00109	The memory still shamed him, but he had not been alone.
00110	Others had run as well, hundreds of them, thousands.
00111	The battle was lost.
00112	The knights had come, invincible in their steel, killing everyone who stayed to fight.
00113	It was run or die.
00114	Death was not so easily outrun, however.
00115	So when Varamyr came upon the dead woman in the wood, he knelt to strip the cloak from her, and never saw the boy until he burst from hiding to drive the long bone knife into his side and rip the cloak out of his clutching fingers.
00116	“His mother,” Thistle told him later, after the boy had run off.
00117	“It were his mother’s cloak, and when he saw you robbing her …” “She was dead,” Varamyr said, wincing as her bone needle pierced his flesh.
00118	“Someone smashed her head.
00119	Some crow.
00120	” “No crow.
00121	Hornfoot men.
00122	I saw it.
00123	” Her needle pulled the gash in his side closed.
00124	“Savages, and who’s left to tame them?” No one.
00125	If Mance is dead, the free folk are doomed.
00126	The Thenns, giants, and the Hornfoot men, the cave:dwellers with their filed teeth, and the men of the western shore with their chariots of bone … all of them were doomed as well.
00127	Even the crows.
00128	They might not know it yet, but those black:cloaked bastards would perish with the rest.
00129	The enemy was coming.
00130	Haggon’s rough voice echoed in his head.
00131	“You will die a dozen deaths, boy, and every one will hurt … but when your true death comes, you will live again.
00132	The second life is simpler and sweeter, they say.
00133	” Varamyr Sixskins would know the truth of that soon enough.
00134	He could taste his true death in the smoke that hung acrid in the air, feel it in the heat beneath his fingers when he slipped a hand under his clothes to touch his wound.
00135	The chill was in him too, though, deep down in his bones.
00136	This time it would be cold that killed him.
00137	His last death had been by fire.
00138	I burned.
00139	At first, in his confusion, he thought some archer on the Wall had pierced him with a flaming arrow … but the fire had been inside him, consuming him.
00140	And the pain … Varamyr had died nine times before.
00141	He had died once from a spear thrust, once with a bear’s teeth in his throat, and once in a wash of blood as he brought forth a stillborn cub.
00142	He died his first death when he was only six, as his father’s axe crashed through his skull.
00143	Even that had not been so agonizing as the fire in his guts, crackling along his wings, devouring him.
00144	When he tried to fly from it, his terror fanned the flames and made them burn hotter.
00145	One moment he had been soaring above the Wall, his eagle’s eyes marking the movements of the men below.
00146	Then the flames had turned his heart into a blackened cinder and sent his spirit screaming back into his own skin, and for a little while he’d gone mad.
00147	Even the memory was enough to make him shudder.
00148	That was when he noticed that his fire had gone out.
00149	Only a grey:and:black tangle of charred wood remained, with a few embers glowing in the ashes.
00150	There’s still smoke, it just needs wood.
00151	Gritting his teeth against the pain, Varamyr crept to the pile of broken branches Thistle had gathered before she went off hunting, and tossed a few sticks onto the ashes.
00152	“Catch,” he croaked.
00153	“Burn.
00154	” He blew upon the embers and said a wordless prayer to the nameless gods of wood and hill and field.
00155	The gods gave no answer.
00156	After a while, the smoke ceased to rise as well.
00157	Already the little hut was growing colder.
00158	Varamyr had no flint, no tinder, no dry kindling.
00159	He would never get the fire burning again, not by himself.
00160	“Thistle,” he called out, his voice hoarse and edged with pain.
00161	“Thistle!” Her chin was pointed and her nose flat, and she had a mole on one cheek with four dark hairs growing from it.
00162	An ugly face, and hard, yet he would have given much to glimpse it in the door of the hut.
00163	I should have taken her before she left.
00164	How long had she been gone? Two days? Three? Varamyr was uncertain.
00165	It was dark inside the hut, and he had been drifting in and out of sleep, never quite sure if it was day or night outside.
00166	“Wait,” she’d said.
00167	“I will be back with food.
00168	” So like a fool he’d waited, dreaming of Haggon and Bump and all the wrongs he had done in his long life, but days and nights had passed and Thistle had not returned.
00169	She won’t be coming back.
00170	Varamyr wondered if he had given himself away.
00171	Could she tell what he was thinking just from looking at him, or had he muttered in his fever dream? Abomination, he heard Haggon saying.
00172	It was almost as if he were here, in this very room.
00173	“She is just some ugly spearwife,” Varamyr told him.
00174	“I am a great man.
00175	I am Varamyr, the warg, the skinchanger, it is not right that she should live and I should die.
00176	” No one answered.
00177	There was no one there.
00178	Thistle was gone.
00179	She had abandoned him, the same as all the rest.
00180	His own mother had abandoned him as well.
00181	She cried for Bump, but she never cried for me.
00182	The morning his father pulled him out of bed to deliver him to Haggon, she would not even look at him.
00183	He had shrieked and kicked as he was dragged into the woods, until his father slapped him and told him to be quiet.
00184	“You belong with your own kind,” was all he said when he flung him down at Haggon’s feet.
00185	He was not wrong, Varamyr thought, shivering.
00186	Haggon taught me much and more.
00187	He taught me how to hunt and fish, how to butcher a carcass and bone a fish, how to find my way through the woods.
00188	And he taught me the way of the warg and the secrets of the skinchanger, though my gift was stronger than his own.
00189	Years later he had tried to find his parents, to tell them that their Lump had become the great Varamyr Sixskins, but both of them were dead and burned.
00190	Gone into the trees and streams, gone into the rocks and earth.
00191	Gone to dirt and ashes.
00192	That was what the woods witch told his mother, the day Bump died.
00193	Lump did not want to be a clod of earth.
00194	The boy had dreamed of a day when bards would sing of his deeds and pretty girls would kiss him.
00195	When I am grown I will be the King:Beyond:the:Wall, Lump had promised himself.
00196	He never had, but he had come close.
00197	Varamyr Sixskins was a name men feared.
00198	He rode to battle on the back of a snow bear thirteen feet tall, kept three wolves and a shadowcat in thrall, and sat at the right hand of Mance Rayder.
00199	It was Mance who brought me to this place.
00200	I should not have listened.
00201	I should have slipped inside my bear and torn him to pieces.
00202	Before Mance, Varamyr Sixskins had been a lord of sorts.
00203	He lived alone in a hall of moss and mud and hewn logs that had once been Haggon’s, attended by his beasts.
00204	A dozen villages did him homage in bread and salt and cider, offering him fruit from their orchards and vegetables from their gardens.
00205	His meat he got himself.
00206	Whenever he desired a woman he sent his shadowcat to stalk her, and whatever girl he’d cast his eye upon would follow meekly to his bed.
00207	Some came weeping, aye, but still they came.
00208	Varamyr gave them his seed, took a hank of their hair to remember them by, and sent them back.
00209	From time to time, some village hero would come with spear in hand to slay the beastling and save a sister or a lover or a daughter.
00210	Those he killed, but he never harmed the women.
00211	Some he even blessed with children.
00212	Runts.
00213	Small, puny things, like Lump, and not one with the gift.
00214	Fear drove him to his feet, reeling.
00215	Holding his side to staunch the seep of blood from his wound, Varamyr lurched to the door and swept aside the ragged skin that covered it to face a wall of white.
00216	Snow.
00217	No wonder it had grown so dark and smoky inside.
00218	The falling snow had buried the hut.
00219	When Varamyr pushed at it, the snow crumbled and gave way, still soft and wet.
00220	Outside, the night was white as death:: pale thin clouds danced attendance on a silver moon, while a thousand stars watched coldly.
00221	He could see the humped shapes of other huts buried beneath drifts of snow, and beyond them the pale shadow of a weirwood armored in ice.
00222	To the south and west the hills were a vast white wilderness where nothing moved except the blowing snow.
00223	“Thistle,” Varamyr called feebly, wondering how far she could have gone.
00224	“Thistle.
00225	Woman.
00226	Where are you?” Far away, a wolf gave howl.
00227	A shiver went through Varamyr.
00228	He knew that howl as well as Lump had once known his mother’s voice.
00229	One Eye.
00230	He was the oldest of his three, the biggest, the fiercest.
00231	Stalker was leaner, quicker, younger, Sly more cunning, but both went in fear of One Eye.
00232	The old wolf was fearless, relentless, savage.
00233	Varamyr had lost control of his other beasts in the agony of the eagle’s death.
00234	His shadowcat had raced into the woods, whilst his snow bear turned her claws on those around her, ripping apart four men before falling to a spear.
00235	She would have slain Varamyr had he come within her reach.
00236	The bear hated him, had raged each time he wore her skin or climbed upon her back.
00237	His wolves, though … My brothers.
00238	My pack.
00239	Many a cold night he had slept with his wolves, their shaggy bodies piled up around him to help keep him warm.
00240	When I die they will feast upon my flesh and leave only bones to greet the thaw come spring.
00241	The thought was queerly comforting.
00242	His wolves had often foraged for him as they roamed:: it seemed only fitting that he should feed them in the end.
00243	He might well begin his second life tearing at the warm dead flesh of his own corpse.
00244	Dogs were the easiest beasts to bond with:: they lived so close to men that they were almost human.
00245	Slipping into a dog’s skin was like putting on an old boot, its leather softened by wear.
00246	As a boot was shaped to accept a foot, a dog was shaped to accept a collar, even a collar no human eye could see.
00247	Wolves were harder.
00248	A man might befriend a wolf, even break a wolf, but no man could truly tame a wolf.
00249	“Wolves and women wed for life,” Haggon often said.
00250	“You take one, that’s a marriage.
00251	The wolf is part of you from that day on, and you’re part of him.
00252	Both of you will change.
00253	” Other beasts were best left alone, the hunter had declared.
00254	Cats were vain and cruel, always ready to turn on you.
00255	Elk and deer were prey:: wear their skins too long, and even the bravest man became a coward.
00256	Bears, boars, badgers, weasels … Haggon did not hold with such.
00257	“Some skins you never want to wear, boy.
00258	You won’t like what you’d become.
00259	” Birds were the worst, to hear him tell it.
00260	“Men were not meant to leave the earth.
00261	Spend too much time in the clouds and you never want to come back down again.
00262	I know skinchangers who’ve tried hawks, owls, ravens.
00263	Even in their own skins, they sit moony, staring up at the bloody blue.
00264	” Not all skinchangers felt the same, however.
00265	Once, when Lump was ten, Haggon had taken him to a gathering of such.
00266	The wargs were the most numerous in that company, the wolf:brothers, but the boy had found the others stranger and more fascinating.
00267	Borroq looked so much like his boar that all he lacked was tusks, Orell had his eagle, Briar her shadowcat (the moment he saw them, Lump wanted a shadowcat of his own), the goat woman Grisella … None of them had been as strong as Varamyr Sixskins, though, not even Haggon, tall and grim with his hands as hard as stone.
00268	The hunter died weeping after Varamyr took Greyskin from him, driving him out to claim the beast for his own.
00269	No second life for you, old man.
00270	Varamyr Threeskins, he’d called himself back then.
00271	Greyskin made four, though the old wolf was frail and almost toothless and soon followed Haggon into death.
00272	Varamyr could take any beast he wanted, bend them to his will, make their flesh his own.
00273	Dog or wolf, bear or badger … Thistle, he thought.
00274	Haggon would call it an abomination, the blackest sin of all, but Haggon was dead, devoured, and burned.
00275	Mance would have cursed him as well, but Mance was slain or captured.
00276	No one will ever know.
00277	I will be Thistle the spearwife, and Varamyr Sixskins will be dead.
00278	His gift would perish with his body, he expected.
00279	He would lose his wolves, and live out the rest of his days as some scrawny, warty woman … but he would live.
00280	If she comes back.
00281	If I am still strong enough to take her.
00282	A wave of dizziness washed over Varamyr.
00283	He found himself upon his knees, his hands buried in a snowdrift.
00284	He scooped up a fistful of snow and filled his mouth with it, rubbing it through his beard and against his cracked lips, sucking down the moisture.
00285	The water was so cold that he could barely bring himself to swallow, and he realized once again how hot he was.
00286	The snowmelt only made him hungrier.
00287	It was food his belly craved, not water.
00288	The snow had stopped falling, but the wind was rising, filling the air with crystal, slashing at his face as he struggled through the drifts, the wound in his side opening and closing again.
00289	His breath made a ragged white cloud.
00290	When he reached the weirwood tree, he found a fallen branch just long enough to use as a crutch.
00291	Leaning heavily upon it, he staggered toward the nearest hut.
00292	Perhaps the villagers had forgotten something when they fled … a sack of apples, some dried meat, anything to keep him alive until Thistle returned.
00293	He was almost there when his crutch snapped beneath his weight, and his legs went out from under him.
00294	How long he sprawled there with his blood reddening the snow Varamyr could not have said.
00295	The snow will bury me.
00296	It would be a peaceful death.
00297	They say you feel warm near the end, warm and sleepy.
00298	It would be good to feel warm again, though it made him sad to think that he would never see the green lands, the warm lands beyond the Wall that Mance used to sing about.
00299	“The world beyond the Wall is not for our kind,” Haggon used to say.
00300	“The free folk fear skinchangers, but they honor us as well.
00301	South of the Wall, the kneelers hunt us down and butcher us like pigs.
00302	” You warned me, Varamyr thought, but it was you who showed me Eastwatch too.
00303	He could not have been more than ten.
00304	Haggon traded a dozen strings of amber and a sled piled high with pelts for six skins of wine, a block of salt, and a copper kettle.
00305	Eastwatch was a better place to trade than Castle Black:: that was where the ships came, laden with goods from the fabled lands beyond the sea.
00306	The crows knew Haggon as a hunter and a friend to the Night’s Watch, and welcomed the news he brought of life beyond their Wall.
00307	Some knew him for a skinchanger too, but no one spoke of that.
00308	It was there at Eastwatch:by:the:Sea that the boy he’d been first began to dream of the warm south.
00309	Varamyr could feel the snowflakes melting on his brow.
00310	This is not so bad as burning.
00311	Let me sleep and never wake, let me begin my second life.
00312	His wolves were close now.
00313	He could feel them.
00314	He would leave this feeble flesh behind, become one with them, hunting the night and howling at the moon.
00315	The warg would become a true wolf.
00316	Which, though? Not Sly.
00317	Haggon would have called it abomination, but Varamyr had often slipped inside her skin as she was being mounted by One Eye.
00318	He did not want to spend his new life as a bitch, though, not unless he had no other choice.
00319	Stalker might suit him better, the younger male … though One Eye was larger and fiercer, and it was One Eye who took Sly whenever she went into heat.
00320	“They say you forget,” Haggon had told him, a few weeks before his own death.
00321	“When the man’s flesh dies, his spirit lives on inside the beast, but every day his memory fades, and the beast becomes a little less a warg, a little more a wolf, until nothing of the man is left and only the beast remains.
00322	” Varamyr knew the truth of that.
00323	When he claimed the eagle that had been Orell’s, he could feel the other skinchanger raging at his presence.
00324	Orell had been slain by the turncloak crow Jon Snow, and his hate for his killer had been so strong that Varamyr found himself hating the beastling boy as well.
00325	He had known what Snow was the moment he saw that great white direwolf stalking silent at his side.
00326	One skinchanger can always sense another.
00327	Mance should have let me take the direwolf.
00328	There would be a second life worthy of a king.
00329	He could have done it, he did not doubt.
00330	The gift was strong in Snow, but the youth was untaught, still fighting his nature when he should have gloried in it.
00331	Varamyr could see the weirwood’s red eyes staring down at him from the white trunk.
00332	The gods are weighing me.
00333	A shiver went through him.
00334	He had done bad things, terrible things.
00335	He had stolen, killed, raped.
00336	He had gorged on human flesh and lapped the blood of dying men as it gushed red and hot from their torn throats.
00337	He had stalked foes through the woods, fallen on them as they slept, clawed their entrails from their bellies and scattered them across the muddy earth.
00338	How sweet their meat had tasted.
00339	“That was the beast, not me,” he said in a hoarse whisper.
00340	“That was the gift you gave me.
00341	” The gods made no reply.
00342	His breath hung pale and misty in the air.
00343	He could feel ice forming in his beard.
00344	Varamyr Sixskins closed his eyes.
00345	He dreamt an old dream of a hovel by the sea, three dogs whimpering, a woman’s tears.
00346	Bump.
00347	She weeps for Bump, but she never wept for me.
00348	Lump had been born a month before his proper time, and he was sick so often that no one expected him to live.
00349	His mother waited until he was almost four to give him a proper name, and by then it was too late.
00350	The whole village had taken to calling him Lump, the name his sister Meha had given him when he was still in their mother’s belly.
00351	Meha had given Bump his name as well, but Lump’s little brother had been born in his proper time, big and red and robust, sucking greedily at Mother’s teats.
00352	She was going to name him after Father.
00353	Bump died, though.
00354	He died when he was two and I was six, three days before his nameday.
00355	“Your little one is with the gods now,” the woods witch told his mother, as she wept.
00356	“He’ll never hurt again, never hunger, never cry.
00357	The gods have taken him down into the earth, into the trees.
00358	The gods are all around us, in the rocks and streams, in the birds and beasts.
00359	Your Bump has gone to join them.
00360	He’ll be the world and all that’s in it.
00361	” The old woman’s words had gone through Lump like a knife.
00362	Bump sees.
00363	He is watching me.
00364	He knows.
00365	Lump could not hide from him, could not slip behind his mother’s skirts or run off with the dogs to escape his father’s fury.
00366	The dogs.
00367	Loptail, Sniff, the Growler.
00368	They were good dogs.
00369	They were my friends.
00370	When his father found the dogs sniffing round Bump’s body, he had no way of knowing which had done it, so he took his axe to all three.
00371	His hands shook so badly that it took two blows to silence Sniff and four to put the Growler down.
00372	The smell of blood hung heavy in the air, and the sounds the dying dogs had made were terrible to hear, yet Loptail still came when father called him.
00373	He was the oldest dog, and his training overcame his terror.
00374	By the time Lump slipped inside his skin it was too late.
00375	No, Father, please, he tried to say, but dogs cannot speak the tongues of men, so all that emerged was a piteous whine.
00376	The axe crashed into the middle of the old dog’s skull, and inside the hovel the boy let out a scream.
00377	That was how they knew.
00378	Two days later, his father dragged him into the woods.
00379	He brought his axe, so Lump thought he meant to put him down the same way he had done the dogs.
00380	Instead he’d given him to Haggon.
00381	Varamyr woke suddenly, violently, his whole body shaking.
00382	“Get up,” a voice was screaming, “get up, we have to go.
00383	There are hundreds of them.
00384	” The snow had covered him with a stiff white blanket.
00385	So cold.
00386	When he tried to move, he found that his hand was frozen to the ground.
00387	He left some skin behind when he tore it loose.
00388	“Get up,” she screamed again, “they’re coming.
00389	” Thistle had returned to him.
00390	She had him by the shoulders and was shaking him, shouting in his face.
00391	Varamyr could smell her breath and feel the warmth of it upon cheeks gone numb with cold.
00392	Now, he thought, do it now, or die.
00393	He summoned all the strength still in him, leapt out of his own skin, and forced himself inside her.
00394	Thistle arched her back and screamed.
00395	Abomination.
00396	Was that her, or him, or Haggon? He never knew.
00397	His old flesh fell back into the snowdrift as her fingers loosened.
00398	The spear:wife twisted violently, shrieking.
00399	His shadowcat used to fight him wildly, and the snow bear had gone half:mad for a time, snapping at trees and rocks and empty air, but this was worse.
00400	“Get out, get out!” he heard her own mouth shouting.
00401	Her body staggered, fell, and rose again, her hands flailed, her legs jerked this way and that in some grotesque dance as his spirit and her own fought for the flesh.
00402	She sucked down a mouthful of the frigid air, and Varamyr had half a heartbeat to glory in the taste of it and the strength of this young body before her teeth snapped together and filled his mouth with blood.
00403	She raised her hands to his face.
00404	He tried to push them down again, but the hands would not obey, and she was clawing at his eyes.
00405	Abomination, he remembered, drowning in blood and pain and madness.
00406	When he tried to scream, she spat their tongue out.
00407	The white world turned and fell away.
00408	For a moment it was as if he were inside the weirwood, gazing out through carved red eyes as a dying man twitched feebly on the ground and a madwoman danced blind and bloody underneath the moon, weeping red tears and ripping at her clothes.
00409	Then both were gone and he was rising, melting, his spirit borne on some cold wind.
00410	He was in the snow and in the clouds, he was a sparrow, a squirrel, an oak.
00411	A horned owl flew silently between his trees, hunting a hare:: Varamyr was inside the owl, inside the hare, inside the trees.
00412	Deep below the frozen ground, earthworms burrowed blindly in the dark, and he was them as well.
00413	I am the wood, and everything that’s in it, he thought, exulting.
00414	A hundred ravens took to the air, cawing as they felt him pass.
00415	A great elk trumpeted, unsettling the children clinging to his back.
00416	A sleeping direwolf raised his head to snarl at empty air.
00417	Before their hearts could beat again he had passed on, searching for his own, for One Eye, Sly, and Stalker, for his pack.
00418	His wolves would save him, he told himself.
00419	That was his last thought as a man.
00420	True death came suddenly:: he felt a shock of cold, as if he had been plunged into the icy waters of a frozen lake.
00421	Then he found himself rushing over moonlit snows with his packmates close behind him.
00422	Half the world was dark.
00423	One Eye, he knew.
00424	He bayed, and Sly and Stalker gave echo.
00425	When they reached the crest the wolves paused.
00426	Thistle, he remembered, and a part of him grieved for what he had lost and another part for what he’d done.
00427	Below, the world had turned to ice.
00428	Fingers of frost crept slowly up the weirwood, reaching out for each other.
00429	The empty village was no longer empty.
00430	Blue:eyed shadows walked amongst the mounds of snow.
00431	Some wore brown and some wore black and some were naked, their flesh gone white as snow.
00432	A wind was sighing through the hills, heavy with their scents: dead flesh, dry blood, skins that stank of mold and rot and urine.
00433	Sly gave a growl and bared her teeth, her ruff bristling.
00434	Not men.
00435	Not prey.
00436	Not these.
00437	The things below moved, but did not live.
00438	One by one, they raised their heads toward the three wolves on the hill.
00439	The last to look was the thing that had been Thistle.
00440	She wore wool and fur and leather, and over that she wore a coat of hoarfrost that crackled when she moved and glistened in the moonlight.
00441	Pale pink icicles hung from her fingertips, ten long knives of frozen blood.
00442	And in the pits where her eyes had been, a pale blue light was flickering, lending her coarse features an eerie beauty they had never known in life.
00443	She sees me.
00444	TYRION He drank his way across the narrow sea.
00445	The ship was small, his cabin smaller, but the captain would not allow him abovedecks.
00446	The rocking of the deck beneath his feet made his stomach heave, and the wretched food tasted even worse when retched back up.
00447	But why did he need salt beef, hard cheese, and bread crawling with worms when he had wine to nourish him? It was red and sour, very strong.
00448	Sometimes he heaved the wine up too, but there was always more.
00449	“The world is full of wine,” he muttered in the dankness of his cabin.
00450	His father never had any use for drunkards, but what did that matter? His father was dead.
00451	He’d killed him.
00452	A bolt in the belly, my lord, and all for you.
00453	If only I was better with a crossbow, I would have put it through that cock you made me with, you bloody bastard.
00454	Belowdecks, there was neither night nor day.
00455	Tyrion marked time by the comings and goings of the cabin boy who brought the meals he did not eat.
00456	The boy always brought a brush and bucket too, to clean up.
00457	“Is this Dornish wine?” Tyrion asked him once, as he pulled a stopper from a skin.
00458	“It reminds me of a certain snake I knew.
00459	A droll fellow, till a mountain fell on him.
00460	” The cabin boy did not answer.
00461	He was an ugly boy, though admittedly more comely than a certain dwarf with half a nose and a scar from eye to chin.
00462	“Have I offended you?” Tyrion asked, as the boy was scrubbing.
00463	“Were you commanded not to talk to me? Or did some dwarf diddle your mother?” That went unanswered too.
00464	“Where are we sailing? Tell me that.
00465	” Jaime had made mention of the Free Cities, but had never said which one.
00466	“Is it Braavos? Tyrosh? Myr?” Tyrion would sooner have gone to Dorne.
00467	Myrcella is older than Tommen, by Dornish law the Iron Throne is hers.
00468	I will help her claim her rights, as Prince Oberyn suggested.
00469	Oberyn was dead, though, his head smashed to bloody ruin by the armored fist of Ser Gregor Clegane.
00470	And without the Red Viper to urge him on, would Doran Martell even consider such a chancy scheme? He might clap me in chains instead and hand me back to my sweet sister.
00471	The Wall might be safer.
00472	Old Bear Mormont said the Night’s Watch had need of men like Tyrion.
00473	Mormont might be dead, though.
00474	By now Slynt may be the lord commander.
00475	That butcher’s son was not like to have forgotten who sent him to the Wall.
00476	Do I really want to spend the rest of my life eating salt beef and porridge with murderers and thieves? Not that the rest of his life would last very long.
00477	Janos Slynt would see to that.
00478	The cabin boy wet his brush and scrubbed on manfully.
00479	“Have you ever visited the pleasure houses of Lys?” the dwarf inquired.
00480	“Might that be where whores go?” Tyrion could not seem to recall the Valyrian word for whore, and in any case it was too late.
00481	The boy tossed his brush back in his bucket and took his leave.
00482	The wine has blurred my wits.
00483	He had learned to read High Valyrian at his maester’s knee, though what they spoke in the Nine Free Cities … well, it was not so much a dialect as nine dialects on the way to becoming separate tongues.
00484	Tyrion had some Braavosi and a smattering of Myrish.
00485	In Tyrosh he should be able to curse the gods, call a man a cheat, and order up an ale, thanks to a sellsword he had once known at the Rock.
00486	At least in Dorne they speak the Common Tongue.
00487	Like Dornish food and Dornish law, Dornish speech was spiced with the flavors of the Rhoyne, but a man could comprehend it.
00488	Dorne, yes, Dorne for me.
00489	He crawled into his bunk, clutching that thought like a child with a doll.
00490	Sleep had never come easily to Tyrion Lannister.
00491	Aboard that ship it seldom came at all, though from time to time he managed to drink sufficient wine to pass out for a while.
00492	At least he did not dream.
00493	He had dreamed enough for one small life.
00494	And of such follies: love, justice, friendship, glory.
00495	As well dream of being tall.
00496	It was all beyond his reach, Tyrion knew now.
00497	But he did not know where whores go.
00498	“Wherever whores go,” his father had said.
00499	His last words, and what words they were.
00500	The crossbow thrummed, Lord Tywin sat back down, and Tyrion Lannister found himself waddling through the darkness with Varys at his side.
00501	He must have clambered back down the shaft, two hundred and thirty rungs to where orange embers glowed in the mouth of an iron dragon.
00502	He remembered none of it.
00503	Only the sound the crossbow made, and the stink of his father’s bowels opening.
00504	Even in his dying, he found a way to shit on me.
00505	Varys had escorted him through the tunnels, but they never spoke until they emerged beside the Blackwater, where Tyrion had won a famous victory and lost a nose.
00506	That was when the dwarf turned to the eunuch and said, “I’ve killed my father,” in the same tone a man might use to say, “I’ve stubbed my toe.
00507	” The master of whisperers had been dressed as a begging brother, in a moth:eaten robe of brown roughspun with a cowl that shadowed his smooth fat cheeks and bald round head.
00508	“You should not have climbed that ladder,” he said reproachfully.
00509	“Wherever whores go.
00510	” Tyrion had warned his father not to say that word.
00511	If I had not loosed, he would have seen my threats were empty.
00512	He would have taken the crossbow from my hands, as once he took Tysha from my arms.
00513	He was rising when I killed him.
00514	“I killed Shae too,” he confessed to Varys.
00515	“You knew what she was.
00516	” “I did.
00517	But I never knew what he was.
00518	” Varys tittered.
00519	“And now you do.
00520	” I should have killed the eunuch as well.
00521	A little more blood on his hands, what would it matter? He could not say what had stayed his dagger.
00522	Not gratitude.
00523	Varys had saved him from a headsman’s sword, but only because Jaime had compelled him.
00524	Jaime … no, better not to think of Jaime.
00525	He found a fresh skin of wine instead and sucked at it as if it were a woman’s breast.
00526	The sour red ran down his chin and soaked through his soiled tunic, the same one he had been wearing in his cell.
00527	The deck was swaying beneath his feet, and when he tried to rise it lifted sideways and smashed him hard against a bulkhead.
00528	A storm, he realized, or else I am even drunker than I knew.
00529	He retched the wine up and lay in it a while, wondering if the ship would sink.
00530	Is this your vengeance, Father? Has the Father Above made you his Hand? “Such are the wages of the kinslayer,” he said as the wind howled outside.
00531	It did not seem fair to drown the cabin boy and the captain and all the rest for something he had done, but when had the gods ever been fair? And around about then, the darkness gulped him down.
00532	When he stirred again, his head felt like to burst and the ship was spinning round in dizzy circles, though the captain was insisting that they’d come to port.
00533	Tyrion told him to be quiet and kicked feebly as a huge bald sailor tucked him under one arm and carried him squirming to the hold, where an empty wine cask awaited him.
00534	It was a squat little cask, and a tight fit even for a dwarf.
00535	Tyrion pissed himself in his struggles, for all the good it did.
00536	He was crammed face:first into the cask with his knees pushed up against his ears.
00537	The stub of his nose itched horribly, but his arms were pinned so tightly that he could not reach to scratch it.
00538	A palanquin fit for a man of my stature, he thought as they hammered shut the lid.
00539	He could hear voices shouting as he was hoisted up.
00540	Every bounce cracked his head against the bottom of the cask.
00541	The world went round and round as the cask rolled downward, then stopped with a crash that made him want to scream.
00542	Another cask slammed into his, and Tyrion bit his tongue.
00543	That was the longest journey he had ever taken, though it could not have lasted more than half an hour.
00544	He was lifted and lowered, rolled and stacked, upended and righted and rolled again.
00545	Through the wooden staves he heard men shouting, and once a horse whickered nearby.
00546	His stunted legs began to cramp, and soon hurt so badly that he forgot the hammering in his head.
00547	It ended as it had begun, with another roll that left him dizzy and more jouncing.
00548	Outside, strange voices were speaking in a tongue he did not know.
00549	Someone started pounding on the top of the cask and the lid cracked open suddenly.
00550	Light came flooding in, and cool air as well.
00551	Tyrion gasped greedily and tried to stand, but only managed to knock the cask over sideways and spill himself out onto a hard:packed earthen floor.
00552	Above him loomed a grotesque fat man with a forked yellow beard, holding a wooden mallet and an iron chisel.
00553	His bedrobe was large enough to serve as a tourney pavilion, but its loosely knotted belt had come undone, exposing a huge white belly and a pair of heavy breasts that sagged like sacks of suet covered with coarse yellow hair.
00554	He reminded Tyrion of a dead sea cow that had once washed up in the caverns under Casterly Rock.
00555	The fat man looked down and smiled.
00556	“A drunken dwarf,” he said, in the Common Tongue of Westeros.
00557	“A rotting sea cow.
00558	” Tyrion’s mouth was full of blood.
00559	He spat it at the fat man’s feet.
00560	They were in a long, dim cellar with barrel:vaulted ceilings, its stone walls spotted with nitre.
00561	Casks of wine and ale surrounded them, more than enough drink to see a thirsty dwarf safely through the night.
00562	Or through a life.
00563	“You are insolent.
00564	I like that in a dwarf.
00565	” When the fat man laughed, his flesh bounced so vigorously that Tyrion was afraid he might fall and crush him.
00566	“Are you hungry, my little friend? Weary?” “Thirsty.
00567	” Tyrion struggled to his knees.
00568	“And filthy.
00569	” The fat man sniffed.
00570	“A bath first, just so.
00571	Then food and a soft bed, yes? My servants shall see to it.
00572	” His host put the mallet and chisel aside.
00573	“My house is yours.
00574	Any friend of my friend across the water is a friend to Illyrio Mopatis, yes.
00575	” And any friend of Varys the Spider is someone I will trust just as far as I can throw him.
00576	The fat man made good on the promised bath, though.
00577	No sooner did Tyrion lower himself into the hot water and close his eyes than he was fast asleep.
00578	He woke naked on a goose:down feather bed so soft it felt as if he had been swallowed by a cloud.
00579	His tongue was growing hair and his throat was raw, but his cock was as hard as an iron bar.
00580	He rolled from the bed, found a chamber pot, and commenced to filling it, with a groan of pleasure.
00581	The room was dim, but there were bars of yellow sunlight showing between the slats of the shutters.
00582	Tyrion shook the last drops off and waddled over patterned Myrish carpets as soft as new spring grass.
00583	Awkwardly he climbed the window seat and flung the shutters open to see where Varys and the gods had sent him.
00584	Beneath his window six cherry trees stood sentinel around a marble pool, their slender branches bare and brown.
00585	A naked boy stood on the water, poised to duel with a bravo’s blade in hand.
00586	He was lithe and handsome, no older than sixteen, with straight blond hair that brushed his shoulders.
00587	So lifelike did he seem that it took the dwarf a long moment to realize he was made of painted marble, though his sword shimmered like true steel.
00588	Across the pool stood a brick wall twelve feet high, with iron spikes along its top.
00589	Beyond that was the city.
00590	A sea of tiled rooftops crowded close around a bay.
00591	He saw square brick towers, a great red temple, a distant manse upon a hill.
00592	In the far distance, sunlight shimmered off deep water.
00593	Fishing boats were moving across the bay, their sails rippling in the wind, and he could see the masts of larger ships poking up along the shore.
00594	Surely one is bound for Dorne, or for Eastwatch:by:the:Sea.
00595	He had no means to pay for passage, though, nor was he made to pull an oar.
00596	I suppose I could sign on as a cabin boy and earn my way by letting the crew bugger me up and down the narrow sea.
00597	He wondered where he was.
00598	Even the air smells different here.
00599	Strange spices scented the chilly autumn wind, and he could hear faint cries drifting over the wall from the streets beyond.
00600	It sounded something like Valyrian, but he did not recognize more than one word in five.
00601	Not Braavos, he concluded, nor Tyrosh.
00602	Those bare branches and the chill in the air argued against Lys and Myr and Volantis as well.
00603	When he heard the door opening behind him, Tyrion turned to confront his fat host.
00604	“This is Pentos, yes?” “Just so.
00605	Where else?” Pentos.
00606	Well, it was not King’s Landing, that much could be said for it.
00607	“Where do whores go?” he heard himself ask.
00608	“Whores are found in brothels here, as in Westeros.
00609	You will have no need of such, my little friend.
00610	Choose from amongst my servingwomen.
00611	None will dare refuse you.
00612	” “Slaves?” the dwarf asked pointedly.
00613	The fat man stroked one of the prongs of his oiled yellow beard, a gesture Tyrion found remarkably obscene.
00614	“Slavery is forbidden in Pentos, by the terms of the treaty the Braavosi imposed on us a hundred years ago.
00615	Still, they will not refuse you.
00616	” Illyrio gave a ponderous half bow.
00617	“But now my little friend must excuse me.
00618	I have the honor to be a magister of this great city, and the prince has summoned us to session.
00619	” He smiled, showing a mouth full of crooked yellow teeth.
00620	“Explore the manse and grounds as you like, but on no account stray beyond the walls.
00621	It is best that no man knows that you were here.
00622	” “Were? Have I gone somewhere?” “Time enough to speak of that this evening.
00623	My little friend and I shall eat and drink and make great plans, yes?” “Yes, my fat friend,” Tyrion replied.
00624	He thinks to use me for his profit.
00625	It was all profit with the merchant princes of the Free Cities.
00626	“Spice soldiers and cheese lords,” his lord father called them, with contempt.
00627	Should a day ever dawn when Illyrio Mopatis saw more profit in a dead dwarf than a live one, Tyrion would find himself packed into another wine cask by dusk.
00628	It would be well if I was gone before that day arrives.
00629	That it would arrive he did not doubt:: Cersei was not like to forget him, and even Jaime might be vexed to find a quarrel in Father’s belly.
00630	A light wind was riffling the waters of the pool below, all around the naked swordsman.
00631	It reminded him of how Tysha would riffle his hair during the false spring of their marriage, before he helped his father’s guardsmen rape her.
00632	He had been thinking of those guardsmen during his flight, trying to recall how many there had been.
00633	You would think he might remember that, but no.
00634	A dozen? A score? A hundred? He could not say.
00635	They had all been grown men, tall and strong … though all men were tall to a dwarf of thirteen years.
00636	Tysha knew their number.
00637	Each of them had given her a silver stag, so she would only need to count the coins.
00638	A silver for each and a gold for me.
00639	His father had insisted that he pay her too.
00640	A Lannister always pays his debts.
00641	“Wherever whores go,” he heard Lord Tywin say once more, and once more the bowstring thrummed.
00642	The magister had invited him to explore the manse.
00643	He found clean clothes in a cedar chest inlaid with lapis and mother:of:pearl.
00644	The clothes had been made for a small boy, he realized as he struggled into them.
00645	The fabrics were rich enough, if a little musty, but the cut was too long in the legs and too short in the arms, with a collar that would have turned his face as black as Joffrey’s had he somehow contrived to get it fastened.
00646	Moths had been at them too.
00647	At least they do not stink of vomit.
00648	Tyrion began his explorations with the kitchen, where two fat women and a potboy watched him warily as he helped himself to cheese, bread, and figs.
00649	“Good morrow to you, fair ladies,” he said with a bow.
00650	“Do you know where whores go?” When they did not respond, he repeated the question in High Valyrian, though he had to say courtesan in place of whore.
00651	The younger, fatter cook gave him a shrug that time.
00652	He wondered what they would do if he took them by the hand and dragged them to his bedchamber.
00653	None will dare refuse you, Illyrio claimed, but somehow Tyrion did not think he meant these two.
00654	The younger woman was old enough to be his mother, and the older was likely her mother.
00655	Both were near as fat as Illyrio, with teats that were larger than his head.
00656	I could smother myself in flesh.
00657	There were worse ways to die.
00658	The way his lord father had died, for one.
00659	I should have made him shit a little gold before expiring.
00660	Lord Tywin might have been niggardly with his approval and affection, but he had always been open:handed when it came to coin.
00661	The only thing more pitiful than a dwarf without a nose is a dwarf without a nose who has no gold.
00662	Tyrion left the fat women to their loaves and kettles and went in search of the cellar where Illyrio had decanted him the night before.
00663	It was not hard to find.
00664	There was enough wine there to keep him drunk for a hundred years:: sweet reds from the Reach and sour reds from Dorne, pale Pentoshi ambers, the green nectar of Myr, three score casks of Arbor gold, even wines from the fabled east, from Qarth and Yi Ti and Asshai by the Shadow.
00665	In the end, Tyrion chose a cask of strongwine marked as the private stock of Lord Runceford Redwyne, the grandfather of the present Lord of the Arbor.
00666	The taste of it was languorous and heady on the tongue, the color a purple so dark that it looked almost black in the dim:lit cellar.
00667	Tyrion filled a cup, and a flagon for good measure, and carried them up to the gardens to drink beneath those cherry trees he’d seen.
00668	As it happened, he left by the wrong door and never found the pool he had spied from his window, but it made no matter.
00669	The gardens behind the manse were just as pleasant, and far more extensive.
00670	He wandered through them for a time, drinking.
00671	The walls would have shamed any proper castle, and the ornamental iron spikes along the top looked strangely naked without heads to adorn them.
00672	Tyrion pictured how his sister’s head might look up there, with tar in her golden hair and flies buzzing in and out of her mouth.
00673	Yes, and Jaime must have the spike beside her, he decided.
00674	No one must ever come between my brother and my sister.
00675	With a rope and a grapnel he might be able to get over that wall.
00676	He had strong arms and he did not weigh much.
00677	He should be able to clamber over, if he did not impale himself on a spike.
00678	I will search for a rope on the morrow, he resolved.
00679	He saw three gates during his wanderings—the main entrance with its gatehouse, a postern by the kennels, and a garden gate hidden behind a tangle of pale ivy.
00680	The last was chained, the others guarded.
00681	The guards were plump, their faces as smooth as babies’ bottoms, and every man of them wore a spiked bronze cap.
00682	Tyrion knew eunuchs when he saw them.
00683	He knew their sort by reputation.
00684	They feared nothing and felt no pain, it was said, and were loyal to their masters unto death.
00685	I could make good use of a few hundred of mine own, he reflected.
00686	A pity I did not think of that before I became a beggar.
00687	He walked along a pillared gallery and through a pointed arch, and found himself in a tiled courtyard where a woman was washing clothes at a well.
00688	She looked to be his own age, with dull red hair and a broad face dotted by freckles.
00689	“Would you like some wine?” he asked her.
00690	She looked at him uncertainly.
00691	“I have no cup for you, we’ll have to share.
00692	” The wash:erwoman went back to wringing out tunics and hanging them to dry.
00693	Tyrion settled on a stone bench with his flagon.
00694	“Tell me, how far should I trust Magister Illyrio?” The name made her look up.
00695	“That far?” Chuckling, he crossed his stunted legs and took a drink.
00696	“I am loath to play whatever part the cheesemonger has in mind for me, yet how can I refuse him? The gates are guarded.
00697	Perhaps you might smuggle me out under your skirts? I’d be so grateful:: why, I’ll even wed you.
00698	I have two wives already, why not three? Ah, but where would we live?” He gave her as pleasant a smile as a man with half a nose could manage.
00699	“I have a niece in Sunspear, did I tell you? I could make rather a lot of mischief in Dorne with Myrcella.
00700	I could set my niece and nephew at war, wouldn’t that be droll?” The washerwoman pinned up one of Illyrio’s tunics, large enough to double as a sail.
00701	“I should be ashamed to think such evil thoughts, you’re quite right.
00702	Better if I sought the Wall instead.
00703	All crimes are wiped clean when a man joins the Night’s Watch, they say.
00704	Though I fear they would not let me keep you, sweetling.
00705	No women in the Watch, no sweet freckly wives to warm your bed at night, only cold winds, salted cod, and small beer.
00706	Do you think I might stand taller in black, my lady?” He filled his cup again.
00707	“What do you say? North or south? Shall I atone for old sins or make some new ones?” The washerwoman gave him one last glance, picked up her basket, and walked away.
00708	I cannot seem to hold a wife for very long, Tyrion reflected.
00709	Somehow his flagon had gone dry.
00710	Perhaps I should stumble back down to the cellars.
00711	The strongwine was making his head spin, though, and the cellar steps were very steep.
00712	“Where do whores go?” he asked the wash flapping on the line.
00713	Perhaps he should have asked the washerwoman.
00714	Not to imply that you’re a whore, my dear, but perhaps you know where they go.
00715	Or better yet, he should have asked his father.
00716	“Wherever whores go,” Lord Tywin said.
00717	She loved me.
00718	She was a crofter’s daughter, she loved me and she wed me, she put her trust in me.
00719	The empty flagon slipped from his hand and rolled across the yard.
00720	Tyrion pushed himself off the bench and went to fetch it.
00721	As he did, he saw some mushrooms growing up from a cracked paving tile.
00722	Pale white they were, with speckles, and red:ribbed undersides dark as blood.
00723	The dwarf snapped one off and sniffed it.
00724	Delicious, he thought, and deadly.
00725	There were seven of the mushrooms.
00726	Perhaps the Seven were trying to tell him something.
00727	He picked them all, snatched a glove down from the line, wrapped them carefully, and stuffed them down his pocket.
00728	The effort made him dizzy, so afterward he crawled back onto the bench, curled up, and shut his eyes.
00729	When he woke again, he was back in his bedchamber, drowning in the goose:down feather bed once more while a blond girl shook his shoulder.
00730	“My lord,” she said, “your bath awaits.
00731	Magister Illyrio expects you at table within the hour.
00732	” Tyrion propped himself against the pillows, his head in his hands.
00733	“Do I dream, or do you speak the Common Tongue?” “Yes, my lord.
00734	I was bought to please the king.
00735	” She was blue:eyed and fair, young and willowy.
00736	“I am sure you did.
00737	I need a cup of wine.
00738	” She poured for him.
00739	“Magister Illyrio said that I am to scrub your back and warm your bed.
00740	My name—” “—is of no interest to me.
00741	Do you know where whores go?” She flushed.
00742	“Whores sell themselves for coin.
00743	” “Or jewels, or gowns, or castles.
00744	But where do they go?” The girl could not grasp the question.
00745	“Is it a riddle, m’lord? I’m no good at riddles.
00746	Will you tell me the answer?” No, he thought.
00747	I despise riddles, myself.
00748	“I will tell you nothing.
00749	Do me the same favor.
00750	” The only part of you that interests me is the part between your legs, he almost said.
00751	The words were on his tongue, but somehow never passed his lips.
00752	She is not Shae, the dwarf told himself, only some little fool who thinks I play at riddles.
00753	If truth be told, even her cunt did not interest him much.
00754	I must be sick, or dead.
00755	“You mentioned a bath? We must not keep the great cheesemonger waiting.
00756	” As he bathed, the girl washed his feet, scrubbed his back, and brushed his hair.
00757	Afterward she rubbed sweet:smelling ointment into his calves to ease the aches, and dressed him once again in boy’s clothing, a musty pair of burgundy breeches and a blue velvet doublet lined with cloth:of:gold.
00758	“Will my lord want me after he has eaten?” she asked as she was lacing up his boots.
00759	“No.
00760	I am done with women.
00761	” Whores.
00762	The girl took that disappointment too well for his liking.
00763	“If m’lord would prefer a boy, I can have one waiting in his bed.
00764	” M’lord would prefer his wife.
00765	M’lord would prefer a girl named Tysha.
00766	“Only if he knows where whores go.
00767	” The girl’s mouth tightened.
00768	She despises me, he realized, but no more than I despise myself.
00769	That he had fucked many a woman who loathed the very sight of him, Tyrion Lannister had no doubt, but the others had at least the grace to feign affection.
00770	A little honest loathing might be refreshing, like a tart wine after too much sweet.
00771	“I believe I have changed my mind,” he told her.
00772	“Wait for me abed.
00773	Naked, if you please, I’ll be a deal too drunk to fumble at your clothing.
00774	Keep your mouth shut and your thighs open and the two of us should get on splendidly.
00775	” He gave her a leer, hoping for a taste of fear, but all she gave him was revulsion.
00776	No one fears a dwarf.
00777	Even Lord Tywin had not been afraid, though Tyrion had held a crossbow in his hands.
00778	“Do you moan when you are being fucked?” he asked the bedwarmer.
00779	“If it please m’lord.
00780	” “It might please m’lord to strangle you.
00781	That’s how I served my last whore.
00782	Do you think your master would object? Surely not.
00783	He has a hundred more like you, but no one else like me.
00784	” This time, when he grinned, he got the fear he wanted.
00785	Illyrio was reclining on a padded couch, gobbling hot peppers and pearl onions from a wooden bowl.
00786	His brow was dotted with beads of sweat, his pig’s eyes shining above his fat cheeks.
00787	Jewels danced when he moved his hands:: onyx and opal, tiger’s eye and tourmaline, ruby, amethyst, sapphire, emerald, jet and jade, a black diamond, and a green pearl.
00788	I could live for years on his rings, Tyrion mused, though I’d need a cleaver to claim them.
00789	“Come sit, my little friend.
00790	” Illyrio waved him closer.
00791	The dwarf clambered up onto a chair.
00792	It was much too big for him, a cushioned throne intended to accommodate the magister’s massive buttocks, with thick sturdy legs to bear his weight.
00793	Tyrion Lannister had lived all his life in a world that was too big for him, but in the manse of Illyrio Mopatis the sense of disproportion assumed grotesque dimensions.
00794	I am a mouse in a mammoth’s lair, he mused, though at least the mammoth keeps a good cellar.
00795	The thought made him thirsty.
00796	He called for wine.
00797	“Did you enjoy the girl I sent you?” Illyrio asked.
00798	“If I had wanted a girl I would have asked for one.
00799	” “If she failed to please …” “She did all that was required of her.
00800	” “I would hope so.
00801	She was trained in Lys, where they make an art of love.
00802	The king enjoyed her greatly.
00803	” “I kill kings, hadn’t you heard?” Tyrion smiled evilly over his wine cup.
00804	“I want no royal leavings.
00805	” “As you wish.
00806	Let us eat.
00807	” Illyrio clapped his hands together, and serving men came running.
00808	They began with a broth of crab and monkfish, and cold egg lime soup as well.
00809	Then came quails in honey, a saddle of lamb, goose livers drowned in wine, buttered parsnips, and suckling pig.
00810	The sight of it all made Tyrion feel queasy, but he forced himself to try a spoon of soup for the sake of politeness, and once he had tasted it he was lost.
00811	The cooks might be old and fat, but they knew their business.
00812	He had never eaten so well, even at court.
00813	As he was sucking the meat off the bones of his quail, he asked Illyrio about the morning’s summons.
00814	The fat man shrugged.
00815	“There are troubles in the east.
00816	Astapor has fallen, and Meereen.
00817	Ghiscari slave cities that were old when the world was young.
00818	” The suckling pig was carved.
00819	Illyrio reached for a piece of the crackling, dipped it in a plum sauce, and ate it with his fingers.
00820	“Slaver’s Bay is a long way from Pentos.
00821	” Tyrion speared a goose liver on the point of his knife.
00822	No man is as cursed as the kinslayer, he mused, but I could learn to like this hell.
00823	“This is so,” Illyrio agreed, “but the world is one great web, and a man dare not touch a single strand lest all the others tremble.
00824	More wine?” Illyrio popped a pepper into his mouth.
00825	“No, something better.
00826	” He clapped his hands together.
00827	At the sound a serving man entered with a covered dish.
00828	He placed it in front of Tyrion, and Illyrio leaned across the table to remove the lid.
00829	“Mushrooms,” the magister announced, as the smell wafted up.
00830	“Kissed with garlic and bathed in butter.
00831	I am told the taste is exquisite.
00832	Have one, my friend.
00833	Have two.
00834	” Tyrion had a fat black mushroom halfway to his mouth, but something in Illyrio’s voice made him stop abruptly.
00835	“After you, my lord.
00836	” He pushed the dish toward his host.
00837	“No, no.
00838	” Magister Illyrio pushed the mushrooms back.
00839	For a heartbeat it seemed as if a mischievous boy was peering out from inside the cheese:monger’s bloated flesh.
00840	“After you.
00841	I insist.
00842	Cook made them specially for you.
00843	” “Did she indeed?” He remembered the cook, the flour on her hands, heavy breasts shot through with dark blue veins.
00844	“That was kind of her, but … no.
00845	” Tyrion eased the mushroom back into the lake of butter from which it had emerged.
00846	“You are too suspicious.
00847	” Illyrio smiled through his forked yellow beard.
00848	Oiled every morning to make it gleam like gold, Tyrion suspected.
00849	“Are you craven? I had not heard that of you.
00850	” “In the Seven Kingdoms it is considered a grave breach of hospitality to poison your guest at supper.
00851	” “Here as well.
00852	” Illyrio Mopatis reached for his wine cup.
00853	“Yet when a guest plainly wishes to end his own life, why, his host must oblige him, no?” He took a gulp.
00854	“Magister Ordello was poisoned by a mushroom not half a year ago.
00855	The pain is not so much, I am told.
00856	Some cramping in the gut, a sudden ache behind the eyes, and it is done.
00857	Better a mushroom than a sword through your neck, is it not so? Why die with the taste of blood in your mouth when it could be butter and garlic?” The dwarf studied the dish before him.
00858	The smell of garlic and butter had his mouth watering.
00859	Some part of him wanted those mushrooms, even knowing what they were.
00860	He was not brave enough to take cold steel to his own belly, but a bite of mushroom would not be so hard.
00861	That frightened him more than he could say.
00862	“You mistake me,” he heard himself say.
00863	“Is it so? I wonder.
00864	If you would sooner drown in wine, say the word and it shall be done, and quickly.
00865	Drowning cup by cup wastes time and wine both.
00866	” “You mistake me,” Tyrion said again, more loudly.
00867	The buttered mushrooms glistened in the lamplight, dark and inviting.
00868	“I have no wish to die, I promise you.
00869	I have …” His voice trailed off into uncertainty.
00870	What do I have? A life to live? Work to do? Children to raise, lands to rule, a woman to love? “You have nothing,” finished Magister Illyrio, “but we can change that.
00871	” He plucked a mushroom from the butter, and chewed it lustily.
00872	“Delicious.
00873	” “The mushrooms are not poisoned.
00874	” Tyrion was irritated.
00875	“No.
00876	Why should I wish you ill?” Magister Illyrio ate another.
00877	“We must show a little trust, you and I.
00878	Come, eat.
00879	” He clapped his hands again.
00880	“We have work to do.
00881	My little friend must keep his strength up.
00882	” The serving men brought out a heron stuffed with figs, veal cutlets blanched with almond milk, creamed herring, candied onions, foul:smelling cheeses, plates of snails and sweetbreads, and a black swan in her plumage.
00883	Tyrion refused the swan, which reminded him of a supper with his sister.
00884	He helped himself to heron and herring, though, and a few of the sweet onions.
00885	And the serving men filled his wine cup anew each time he emptied it.
00886	“You drink a deal of wine for such a little man.
00887	” “Kinslaying is dry work.
00888	It gives a man a thirst.
00889	” The fat man’s eyes glittered like the gemstones on his fingers.
00890	“There are those in Westeros who would say that killing Lord Lannister was merely a good beginning.
00891	” “They had best not say it in my sister’s hearing, or they will find themselves short a tongue.
00892	” The dwarf tore a loaf of bread in half.
00893	“And you had best be careful what you say of my family, magister.
00894	Kinslayer or no, I am a lion still.
00895	” That seemed to amuse the lord of cheese no end.
00896	He slapped a meaty thigh and said, “You Westerosi are all the same.
00897	You sew some beast upon a scrap of silk, and suddenly you are all lions or dragons or eagles.
00898	I can take you to a real lion, my little friend.
00899	The prince keeps a pride in his menagerie.
00900	Would you like to share a cage with them?” The lords of the Seven Kingdoms did make rather much of their sigils, Tyrion had to admit.
00901	“Very well,” he conceded.
00902	“A Lannister is not a lion.
00903	Yet I am still my father’s son, and Jaime and Cersei are mine to kill.
00904	” “How odd that you should mention your fair sister,” said Illyrio, between snails.
00905	“The queen has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head, no matter how humble his birth.
00906	” It was no more than Tyrion had expected.
00907	“If you mean to take her up on it, make her spread her legs for you as well.
00908	The best part of me for the best part of her, that’s a fair trade.
00909	” “I would sooner have mine own weight in gold.
00910	” The cheesemonger laughed so hard that Tyrion feared he was about to rupture.
00911	“All the gold in Casterly Rock, why not?” “The gold I grant you,” the dwarf said, relieved that he was not about to drown in a gout of half:digested eels and sweetmeats, “but the Rock is mine.
00912	” “Just so.
00913	” The magister covered his mouth and belched a mighty belch.
00914	“Do you think King Stannis will give it to you? I am told he is a great one for the law.
00915	Your brother wears the white cloak, so you are heir by all the laws of Westeros.
00916	” “Stannis might well grant me Casterly Rock,” said Tyrion, “but for the small matter of regicide and kinslaying.
00917	For those he would shorten me by a head, and I am short enough as I stand.
00918	But why would you think I mean to join Lord Stannis?” “Why else would you go the Wall?” “Stannis is at the Wall?” Tyrion rubbed at his nose.
00919	“What in seven bloody hells is Stannis doing at the Wall?” “Shivering, I would think.
00920	It is warmer down in Dorne.
00921	Perhaps he should have sailed that way.
00922	” Tyrion was beginning to suspect that a certain freckled washerwoman knew more of the Common Speech than she pretended.
00923	“My niece Myrcella is in Dorne, as it happens.
00924	And I have half a mind to make her a queen.
00925	” Illyrio smiled as his serving men spooned out bowls of black cherries in sweet cream for them both.
00926	“What has this poor child done to you that you would wish her dead?” “Even a kinslayer is not required to slay all his kin,” said Tyrion, wounded.
00927	“Queen her, I said.
00928	Not kill her.
00929	” The cheesemonger spooned up cherries.
00930	“In Volantis they use a coin with a crown on one face and a death’s:head on the other.
00931	Yet it is the same coin.
00932	To queen her is to kill her.
00933	Dorne might rise for Myrcella, but Dorne alone is not enough.
00934	If you are as clever as our friend insists, you know this.
00935	” Tyrion looked at the fat man with new interest.
00936	He is right on both counts.
00937	To queen her is to kill her.
00938	And I knew that.
00939	“Futile gestures are all that remain to me.
00940	This one would make my sister weep bitter tears, at least.
00941	” Magister Illyrio wiped sweet cream from his mouth with the back of a fat hand.
00942	“The road to Casterly Rock does not go through Dorne, my little friend.
00943	Nor does it run beneath the Wall.
00944	Yet there is such a road, I tell you.
00945	” “I am an attainted traitor, a regicide, and kinslayer.
00946	” This talk of roads annoyed him.
00947	Does he think this is a game? “What one king does, another may undo.
00948	In Pentos we have a prince, my friend.
00949	He presides at ball and feast and rides about the city in a palanquin of ivory and gold.
00950	Three heralds go before him with the golden scales of trade, the iron sword of war, and the silver scourge of justice.
00951	On the first day of each new year he must deflower the maid of the fields and the maid of the seas.
00952	” Illyrio leaned forward, elbows on the table.
00953	“Yet should a crop fail or a war be lost, we cut his throat to appease the gods and choose a new prince from amongst the forty families.
00954	” “Remind me never to become the Prince of Pentos.
00955	” “Are your Seven Kingdoms so different? There is no peace in Westeros, no justice, no faith … and soon enough, no food.
00956	When men are starving and sick of fear, they look for a savior.
00957	” “They may look, but if all they find is Stannis—” “Not Stannis.
00958	Nor Myrcella.
00959	” The yellow smile widened.
00960	“Another.
00961	Stronger than Tommen, gentler than Stannis, with a better claim than the girl Myrcella.
00962	A savior come from across the sea to bind up the wounds of bleeding Westeros.
00963	” “Fine words.
00964	” Tyrion was unimpressed.
00965	“Words are wind.
00966	Who is this bloody savior?” “A dragon.
00967	” The cheesemonger saw the look on his face at that, and laughed.
00968	“A dragon with three heads.
00969	” DAENERYS She could hear the dead man coming up the steps.
00970	The slow, measured sound of footsteps went before him, echoing amongst the purple pillars of her hall.
00971	Daenerys Targaryen awaited him upon the ebon bench that she had made her throne.
00972	Her eyes were soft with sleep, her silver:gold hair all tousled.
00973	“Your Grace,” said Ser Barristan Selmy, the lord commander of her Queensguard, “there is no need for you to see this.
00974	” “He died for me.
00975	” Dany clutched her lion pelt to her chest.
00976	Underneath, a sheer white linen tunic covered her to midthigh.
00977	She had been dreaming of a house with a red door when Missandei woke her.
00978	There had been no time to dress.
00979	“Khaleesi,” whispered Irri, “you must not touch the dead man.
00980	It is bad luck to touch the dead.
00981	” “Unless you killed them yourself.
00982	” Jhiqui was bigger:boned than Irri, with wide hips and heavy breasts.
00983	“That is known.
00984	” “It is known,” Irri agreed.
00985	Dothraki were wise where horses were concerned, but could be utter fools about much else.
00986	They are only girls, besides.
00987	Her handmaids were of an age with her—women grown to look at them, with their black hair, copper skin, and almond:shaped eyes, but girls all the same.
00988	They had been given to her when she wed Khal Drogo.
00989	It was Drogo who had given her the pelt she wore, the head and hide of a hrakkar, the white lion of the Dothraki sea.
00990	It was too big for her and had a musty smell, but it made her feel as if her sun:and:stars was still near her.
00991	Grey Worm appeared atop the steps first, a torch in hand.
00992	His bronze cap was crested with three spikes.
00993	Behind him followed four of his Unsullied, bearing the dead man on their shoulders.
00994	Their caps had only one spike each, and their faces showed so little they might have been cast of bronze as well.
00995	They laid the corpse down at her feet.
00996	Ser Barristan pulled back the bloodstained shroud.
00997	Grey Worm lowered the torch, so she might see.
00998	The dead man’s face was smooth and hairless, though his cheeks had been slashed open ear to ear.
00999	He had been a tall man, blue:eyed and fair of face.
01000	Some child of Lys or Old Volantis, snatched off a ship by corsairs and sold into bondage in red Astapor.
01001	Though his eyes were open, it was his wounds that wept.
01002	There were more wounds than she could count.
01003	“Your Grace,” Ser Barristan said, “there was a harpy drawn on the bricks in the alley where he was found …” “… drawn in blood.
01004	” Daenerys knew the way of it by now.
01005	The Sons of the Harpy did their butchery by night, and over each kill they left their mark.
01006	“Grey Worm, why was this man alone? Had he no partner?” By her command, when the Unsullied walked the streets of Meereen by night they always walked in pairs.
01007	“My queen,” replied the captain, “your servant Stalwart Shield had no duty last night.
01008	He had gone to a … a certain place … to drink, and have companionship.
01009	” “A certain place? What do you mean?” “A house of pleasure, Your Grace.
01010	” A brothel.
01011	Half of her freedmen were from Yunkai, where the Wise Masters had been famed for training bedslaves.
01012	The way of the seven sighs.
01013	Brothels had sprouted up like mushrooms all over Meereen.
01014	It is all they know.
01015	They need to survive.
01016	Food was more costly every day, whilst the price of flesh grew cheaper.
01017	In the poorer districts between the stepped pyramids of Meereen’s slaver nobility, there were brothels catering to every conceivable erotic taste, she knew.
01018	Even so … “What could a eunuch hope to find in a brothel?” “Even those who lack a man’s parts may still have a man’s heart, Your Grace,” said Grey Worm.
01019	“This one has been told that your servant Stalwart Shield sometimes gave coin to the women of the brothels to lie with him and hold him.
01020	” The blood of the dragon does not weep.
01021	“Stalwart Shield,” she said, dry:eyed.
01022	“That was his name?” “If it please Your Grace.
01023	” “It is a fine name.
01024	” The Good Masters of Astapor had not allowed their slave soldiers even names.
01025	Some of her Unsullied reclaimed their birth names after she had freed them:: others chose new names for themselves.
01026	“Is it known how many attackers fell upon Stalwart Shield?” “This one does not know.
01027	Many.
01028	” “Six or more,” said Ser Barristan.
01029	“From the look of his wounds, they swarmed him from all sides.
01030	He was found with an empty scabbard.
01031	It may be that he wounded some of his attackers.
01032	” Dany said a silent prayer that somewhere one of the Harpy’s Sons was dying even now, clutching at his belly and writhing in pain.
01033	“Why did they cut open his cheeks like that?” “Gracious queen,” said Grey Worm, “his killers had forced the genitals of a goat down the throat of your servant Stalwart Shield.
01034	This one removed them before bringing him here.
01035	” They could not feed him his own genitals.
01036	The Astapori left him neither root nor stem.
01037	“The Sons grow bolder,” Dany observed.
01038	Until now, they had limited their attacks to unarmed freedmen, cutting them down in the streets or breaking into their homes under the cover of darkness to murder them in their beds.
01039	“This is the first of my soldiers they have slain.
01040	” “The first,” Ser Barristan warned, “but not the last.
01041	” I am still at war, Dany realized, only now I am fighting shadows.
01042	She had hoped for a respite from the killing, for some time to build and heal.
01043	Shrugging off the lion pelt, she knelt beside the corpse and closed the dead man’s eyes, ignoring Jhiqui’s gasp.
01044	“Stalwart Shield shall not be forgotten.
01045	Have him washed and dressed for battle and bury him with cap and shield and spears.
01046	” “It shall be as Your Grace commands,” said Grey Worm.
01047	“Send men to the Temple of the Graces and ask if any man has come to the Blue Graces with a sword wound.
01048	And spread the word that we will pay good gold for the short sword of Stalwart Shield.
01049	Inquire of the butchers and the herdsmen, and learn who has been gelding goats of late.
01050	” Perhaps some goatherd would confess.
01051	“Henceforth, no man of mine walks alone after dark.
01052	” “These ones shall obey.
01053	” Daenerys pushed her hair back.
01054	“Find these cowards for me.
01055	Find them, so that I might teach the Harpy’s Sons what it means to wake the dragon.
01056	” Grey Worm saluted her.
01057	His Unsullied closed the shroud once more, lifted the dead man onto their shoulders, and bore him from the hall.
01058	Ser Barristan Selmy remained behind.
01059	His hair was white, and there were crow’s:feet at the corners of his pale blue eyes.
01060	Yet his back was still un:bent, and the years had not yet robbed him of his skill at arms.
01061	“Your Grace,” he said, “I fear your eunuchs are ill suited for the tasks you set them.
01062	” Dany settled on her bench and wrapped her pelt about her shoulders once again.
01063	“The Unsullied are my finest warriors.
01064	” “Soldiers, not warriors, if it please Your Grace.
01065	They were made for the battlefield, to stand shoulder to shoulder behind their shields with their spears thrust out before them.
01066	Their training teaches them to obey, fearlessly, perfectly, without thought or hesitation … not to unravel secrets or ask questions.
01067	” “Would knights serve me any better?” Selmy was training knights for her, teaching the sons of slaves to fight with lance and longsword in the Westerosi fashion … but what good would lances do against cowards who killed from the shadows? “Not in this,” the old man admitted.
01068	“And Your Grace has no knights, save me.
01069	It will be years before the boys are ready.
01070	” “Then who, if not Unsullied? Dothraki would be even worse.
01071	” Dothraki fought from horseback.
01072	Mounted men were of more use in open fields and hills than in the narrow streets and alleys of the city.
01073	Beyond Meereen’s walls of many:colored brick, Dany’s rule was tenuous at best.
01074	Thousands of slaves still toiled on vast estates in the hills, growing wheat and olives, herding sheep and goats, and mining salt and copper.
01075	Meereen’s storehouses held ample supplies of grain, oil, olives, dried fruit, and salted meat, but the stores were dwindling.
01076	So Dany had dispatched her tiny khalasar to subdue the hinterlands, under the command of her three bloodriders, whilst Brown Ben Plumm took his Second Sons south to guard against Yunkish incursions.
01077	The most crucial task of all she had entrusted to Daario Naharis, glib:tongued Daario with his gold tooth and trident beard, smiling his wicked smile through purple whiskers.
01078	Beyond the eastern hills was a range of rounded sandstone mountains, the Khyzai Pass, and Lhazar.
01079	If Daario could convince the Lhazarene to reopen the overland trade routes, grains could be brought down the river or over the hills at need … but the Lamb Men had no reason to love Meereen.
01080	“When the Stormcrows return from Lhazar, perhaps I can use them in the streets,” she told Ser Barristan, “but until then I have only the Unsullied.
01081	” Dany rose.
01082	“You must excuse me, ser.
01083	The petitioners will soon be at my gates.
01084	I must don my floppy ears and become their queen again.
01085	Summon Reznak and the Shavepate, I’ll see them when I’m dressed.
01086	” “As Your Grace commands.
01087	” Selmy bowed.
01088	The Great Pyramid shouldered eight hundred feet into the sky, from its huge square base to the lofty apex where the queen kept her private chambers, surrounded by greenery and fragrant pools.
01089	As a cool blue dawn broke over the city, Dany walked out onto the terrace.
01090	To the west sunlight blazed off the golden domes of the Temple of the Graces, and etched deep shadows behind the stepped pyramids of the mighty.
01091	In some of those pyramids, the Sons of the Harpy are plotting new murders even now, and I am powerless to stop them.
01092	Viserion sensed her disquiet.
01093	The white dragon lay coiled around a pear tree, his head resting on his tail.
01094	When Dany passed his eyes came open, two pools of molten gold.
01095	His horns were gold as well, and the scales that ran down his back from head to tail.
01096	“You’re lazy,” she told him, scratching under his jaw.
01097	His scales were hot to the touch, like armor left too long in the sun.
01098	Dragons are fire made flesh.
01099	She had read that in one of the books Ser Jorah had given her as a wedding gift.
01100	“You should be hunting with your brothers.
01101	Have you and Drogon been fighting again?” Her dragons were growing wild of late.
01102	Rhaegal had snapped at Irri, and Viserion had set Reznak’s tokar ablaze the last time the seneschal had called.
01103	I have left them too much to themselves, but where am I to find the time for them? Viserion’s tail lashed sideways, thumping the trunk of the tree so hard that a pear came tumbling down to land at Dany’s feet.
01104	His wings unfolded, and he half flew, half hopped onto the parapet.
01105	He grows, she thought as he launched himself into the sky.
01106	They are all three growing.
01107	Soon they will be large enough to bear my weight.
01108	Then she would fly as Aegon the Conqueror had flown, up and up, until Meereen was so small that she could blot it out with her thumb.
01109	She watched Viserion climb in widening circles until he was lost to sight beyond the muddy waters of the Skahazadhan.
01110	Only then did Dany go back inside the pyramid, where Irri and Jhiqui were waiting to brush the tangles from her hair and garb her as befit the Queen of Meereen, in a Ghiscari tokar.
01111	The garment was a clumsy thing, a long loose shapeless sheet that had to be wound around her hips and under an arm and over a shoulder, its dangling fringes carefully layered and displayed.
01112	Wound too loose, it was like to fall off:: wound too tight, it would tangle, trip, and bind.
01113	Even wound properly, the tokar required its wearer to hold it in place with the left hand.
01114	Walking in a tokar demanded small, mincing steps and exquisite balance, lest one tread upon those heavy trailing fringes.
01115	It was not a garment meant for any man who had to work.
01116	The tokar was a master’s garment, a sign of wealth and power.
01117	Dany had wanted to ban the tokar when she took Meereen, but her advisors had convinced her otherwise.
01118	“The Mother of Dragons must don the tokar or be forever hated,” warned the Green Grace, Galazza Galare.
01119	“In the wools of Westeros or a gown of Myrish lace, Your Radiance shall forever remain a stranger amongst us, a grotesque outlander, a barbarian conqueror.
01120	Meereen’s queen must be a lady of Old Ghis.
01121	” Brown Ben Plumm, the captain of the Second Sons, had put it more succinctly.
01122	“Man wants to be the king o’ the rabbits, he best wear a pair o’ floppy ears.
01123	” The floppy ears she chose today were made of sheer white linen, with a fringe of golden tassels.
01124	With Jhiqui’s help, she wound the tokar about herself correctly on her third attempt.
01125	Irri fetched her crown, wrought in the shape of the three:headed dragon of her House.
01126	Its coils were gold, its wings silver, its three heads ivory, onyx, and jade.
01127	Dany’s neck and shoulders would be stiff and sore from the weight of it before the day was done.
01128	A crown should not sit easy on the head.
01129	One of her royal forebears had said that, once.
01130	Some Aegon, but which one? Five Aegons had ruled the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.
01131	There would have been a sixth, but the Usurper’s dogs had murdered her brother’s son when he was still a babe at the breast.
01132	If he had lived, I might have married him.
01133	Aegon would have been closer to my age than Viserys.
01134	Dany had only been conceived when Aegon and his sister were murdered.
01135	Their father, her brother Rhaegar, perished even earlier, slain by the Usurper on the Trident.
01136	Her brother Viserys had died screaming in Vaes Dothrak with a crown of molten gold upon his head.
01137	They will kill me too if I allow it.
01138	The knives that slew my Stalwart Shield were meant for me.
01139	She had not forgotten the slave children the Great Masters had nailed up along the road from Yunkai.
01140	They had numbered one hundred sixty:three, a child every mile, nailed to mileposts with one arm outstretched to point her way.
01141	After Meereen had fallen, Dany had nailed up a like number of Great Masters.
01142	Swarms of flies had attended their slow dying, and the stench had lingered long in the plaza.
01143	Yet some days she feared that she had not gone far enough.
01144	These Meereenese were a sly and stubborn people who resisted her at every turn.
01145	They had freed their slaves, yes … only to hire them back as servants at wages so meagre that most could scarce afford to eat.
01146	Those too old or young to be of use had been cast into the streets, along with the infirm and the crippled.
01147	And still the Great Masters gathered atop their lofty pyramids to complain of how the dragon queen had filled their noble city with hordes of unwashed beggars, thieves, and whores.
01148	To rule Meereen I must win the Meereenese, however much I may despise them.
01149	“I am ready,” she told Irri.
01150	Reznak and Skahaz waited atop the marble steps.
01151	“Great queen,” declared Reznak mo Reznak, “you are so radiant today I fear to look on you.
01152	” The seneschal wore a tokar of maroon silk with a golden fringe.
01153	A small, damp man, he smelled as if he had bathed in perfume and spoke a bastard form of High Valyrian, much corrupted and flavored with a thick Ghiscari growl.
01154	“You are kind to say so,” Dany answered, in the same tongue.
01155	“My queen,” growled Skahaz mo Kandaq, of the shaven head.
01156	Ghiscari hair was dense and wiry:: it had long been the fashion for the men of the Slaver Cities to tease it into horns and spikes and wings.
01157	By shaving, Skahaz had put old Meereen behind him to accept the new, and his kin had done the same after his example.
01158	Others followed, though whether from fear, fashion, or ambition, Dany could not say:: shavepates, they were called.
01159	Skahaz was the Shavepate … and the vilest of traitors to the Sons of the Harpy and their ilk.
01160	“We were told about the eunuch.
01161	” “His name was Stalwart Shield.
01162	” “More will die unless the murderers are punished.
01163	” Even with his shaven scalp, Skahaz had an odious face—a beetled brow, small eyes with heavy bags beneath them, a big nose dark with blackheads, oily skin that looked more yellow than the usual amber of Ghiscari.
01164	It was a blunt, brutal, angry face.
01165	She could only pray it was an honest one as well.
01166	“How can I punish them when I do not know who they are?” Dany demanded of him.
01167	“Tell me that, bold Skahaz.
01168	” “You have no lack of enemies, Your Grace.
01169	You can see their pyramids from your terrace.
01170	Zhak, Hazkar, Ghazeen, Merreq, Loraq, all the old slaving families.
01171	Pahl.
01172	Pahl, most of all.
01173	A house of women now.
01174	Bitter old women with a taste for blood.
01175	Women do not forget.
01176	Women do not forgive.
01177	” No, Dany thought, and the Usurper’s dogs will learn that, when I return to Westeros.
01178	It was true that there was blood between her and the House of Pahl.
01179	Oznak zo Pahl had been cut down by Strong Belwas in single combat.
01180	His father, commander of Meereen’s city watch, had died defending the gates when Joso’s Cock smashed them into splinters.
01181	Three uncles had been among the hundred sixty:three on the plaza.
01182	“How much gold have we offered for information concerning the Sons of the Harpy?” Dany asked.
01183	“One hundred honors, if it please Your Radiance.
01184	” “One thousand honors would please us more.
01185	Make it so.
01186	” “Your Grace has not asked for my counsel,” said Skahaz Shavepate, “but I say that blood must pay for blood.
01187	Take one man from each of the families I have named and kill him.
01188	The next time one of yours is slain, take two from each great House and kill them both.
01189	There will not be a third murder.
01190	” Reznak squealed in distress.
01191	“Noooo … gentle queen, such savagery would bring down the ire of the gods.
01192	We will find the murderers, I promise you, and when we do they will prove to be baseborn filth, you shall see.
01193	” The seneschal was as bald as Skahaz, though in his case the gods were responsible.
01194	“Should any hair be so insolent as to appear, my barber stands with razor ready,” he had assured her when she raised him up.
01195	There were times when Dany wondered if that razor might not be better saved for Reznak’s throat.
01196	He was a useful man, but she liked him little and trusted him less.
01197	The Undying of Qarth had told her she would be thrice betrayed.
01198	Mirri Maz Duur had been the first, Ser Jorah the second.
01199	Would Reznak be the third? The Shavepate? Daario? Or will it be someone I would never suspect, Ser Barristan or Grey Worm or Missandei? “Skahaz,” she told the Shavepate, “I thank you for your counsel.
01200	Reznak, see what one thousand honors may accomplish.
01201	” Clutching her tokar, Daenerys swept past them down the broad marble stair.
01202	She took one step at a time, lest she trip over her fringe and go tumbling headfirst into court.
01203	Missandei announced her.
01204	The little scribe had a sweet, strong voice.
01205	“All kneel for Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Khaleesi of Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Shackles, and Mother of Dragons.
01206	” The hall had filled.
01207	Unsullied stood with their backs to the pillars, holding shields and spears, the spikes on their caps jutting upward like a row of knives.
01208	The Meereenese had gathered beneath the eastern windows.
01209	Her freedmen stood well apart from their former masters.
01210	Until they stand together, Meereen will know no peace.
01211	“Arise.
01212	” Dany settled onto her bench.
01213	The hall rose.
01214	That at least they do as one.
01215	Reznak mo Reznak had a list.
01216	Custom demanded that the queen begin with the Astapori envoy, a former slave who called himself Lord Ghael, though no one seemed to know what he was lord of.
01217	Lord Ghael had a mouth of brown and rotten teeth and the pointed yellow face of a weasel.
01218	He also had a gift.
01219	“Cleon the Great sends these slippers as a token of his love for Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons.
01220	” Irri slid the slippers onto Dany’s feet.
01221	They were gilded leather, decorated with green freshwater pearls.
01222	Does the butcher king believe a pair of pretty slippers will win my hand? “King Cleon is most generous.
01223	You may thank him for his lovely gift.
01224	” Lovely, but made for a child.
01225	Dany had small feet, yet the pointed slippers mashed her toes together.
01226	“Great Cleon will be pleased to know they pleased you,” said Lord Ghael.
01227	“His Magnificence bids me say that he stands ready to defend the Mother of Dragons from all her foes.
01228	” If he proposes again that I wed King Cleon, I’ll throw a slipper at his head, Dany thought, but for once the Astapori envoy made no mention of a royal marriage.
01229	Instead he said, “The time has come for Astapor and Meereen to end the savage reign of the Wise Masters of Yunkai, who are sworn foes to all those who live in freedom.
01230	Great Cleon bids me tell you that he and his new Unsullied will soon march.
01231	” His new Unsullied are an obscene jape.
01232	“King Cleon would be wise to tend his own gardens and let the Yunkai’i tend theirs.
01233	” It was not that Dany harbored any love for Yunkai.
01234	She was coming to regret leaving the Yellow City untaken after defeating its army in the field.
01235	The Wise Masters had returned to slaving as soon as she moved on, and were busy raising levies, hiring sellswords, and making alliances against her.
01236	Cleon the self:styled Great was no better, however.
01237	The Butcher King had restored slavery to Astapor, the only change being that the former slaves were now the masters and the former masters were now the slaves.
01238	“I am only a young girl and know little of the ways of war,” she told Lord Ghael, “but we have heard that Astapor is starving.
01239	Let King Cleon feed his people before he leads them out to battle.
01240	” She made a gesture of dismissal.
01241	Ghael withdrew.
01242	“Magnificence,” prompted Reznak mo Reznak, “will you hear the noble Hizdahr zo Loraq?” Again? Dany nodded, and Hizdahr strode forth:: a tall man, very slender, with flawless amber skin.
01243	He bowed on the same spot where Stalwart Shield had lain in death not long before.
01244	I need this man, Dany reminded herself.
01245	Hizdahr was a wealthy merchant with many friends in Meereen, and more across the seas.
01246	He had visited Volantis, Lys, and Qarth, had kin in Tolos and Elyria, and was even said to wield some influence in New Ghis, where the Yunkai’i were trying to stir up enmity against Dany and her rule.
01247	And he was rich.
01248	Famously and fabulously rich … And like to grow richer, if I grant his petition.
01249	When Dany had closed the city’s fighting pits, the value of pit shares had plummeted.
01250	Hizdahr zo Loraq had grabbed them up with both hands, and now owned most of the fighting pits in Meereen.
01251	The nobleman had wings of wiry red:black hair sprouting from his temples.
01252	They made him look as if his head were about to take flight.
01253	His long face was made even longer by a beard bound with rings of gold.
01254	His purple tokar was fringed with amethysts and pearls.
01255	“Your Radiance will know the reason I am here.
01256	” “Why, it must be because you have no other purpose but to plague me.
01257	How many times have I refused you?” “Five times, Your Magnificence.
01258	” “Six now.
01259	I will not have the fighting pits reopened.
01260	” “If Your Majesty will hear my arguments …” “I have.
01261	Five times.
01262	Have you brought new arguments?” “Old arguments,” Hizdahr admitted, “new words.
01263	Lovely words, and courteous, more apt to move a queen.
01264	” “It is your cause I find wanting, not your courtesies.
01265	I have heard your arguments so often I could plead your case myself.
01266	Shall I?” Dany leaned forward.
01267	“The fighting pits have been a part of Meereen since the city was founded.
01268	The combats are profoundly religious in nature, a blood sacrifice to the gods of Ghis.
01269	The mortal art of Ghis is not mere butchery but a display of courage, skill, and strength most pleasing to your gods.
01270	Victorious fighters are pampered and acclaimed, and the slain are honored and remembered.
01271	By reopening the pits I would show the people of Meereen that I respect their ways and customs.
01272	The pits are far:famed across the world.
01273	They draw trade to Meereen, and fill the city’s coffers with coin from the ends of the earth.
01274	All men share a taste for blood, a taste the pits help slake.
01275	In that way they make Meereen more tranquil.
01276	For criminals condemned to die upon the sands, the pits represent a judgment by battle, a last chance for a man to prove his innocence.
01277	” She leaned back again, with a toss of her head.
01278	“There.
01279	How have I done?” “Your Radiance has stated the case much better than I could have hoped to do myself.
01280	I see that you are eloquent as well as beautiful.
01281	I am quite persuaded.
01282	” She had to laugh.
01283	“Ah, but I am not.
01284	” “Your Magnificence,” whispered Reznak mo Reznak in her ear, “it is customary for the city to claim one:tenth of all the profits from the fighting pits, after expenses, as a tax.
01285	That coin might be put to many noble uses.
01286	” “It might … though if we were to reopen the pits, we should take our tenth before expenses.
01287	I am only a young girl and know little of such matters, but I dwelt with Xaro Xhoan Daxos long enough to learn that much.
01288	Hizdahr, if you could marshal armies as you marshal arguments, you could conquer the world … but my answer is still no.
01289	For the sixth time.
01290	” “The queen has spoken.
01291	” He bowed again, as deeply as before.
01292	His pearls and amethysts clattered softly against the marble floor.
01293	A very limber man was Hizdahr zo Loraq.
01294	He might be handsome, but for that silly hair.
01295	Reznak and the Green Grace had been urging Dany to take a Meereenese noble for her husband, to reconcile the city to her rule.
01296	Hizdahr zo Loraq might be worth a careful look.
01297	Sooner him than Skahaz.
01298	The Shavepate had offered to set aside his wife for her, but the notion made her shudder.
01299	Hizdahr at least knew how to smile.
01300	“Magnificence,” said Reznak, consulting his list, “the noble Grazdan zo Galare would address you.
01301	Will you hear him?” “It would be my pleasure,” said Dany, admiring the glimmer of the gold and the sheen of the green pearls on Cleon’s slippers while doing her best to ignore the pinching in her toes.
01302	Grazdan, she had been forewarned, was a cousin of the Green Grace, whose support she had found invaluable.
01303	The priestess was a voice for peace, acceptance, and obedience to lawful authority.
01304	I can give her cousin a respectful hearing, whatever he desires.
01305	What he desired turned out to be gold.
01306	Dany had refused to compensate any of the Great Masters for the value of their slaves, but the Meereenese kept devising other ways to squeeze coin from her.
01307	The noble Grazdan had once owned a slave woman who was a very fine weaver, it seemed:: the fruits of her loom were greatly valued, not only in Meereen, but in New Ghis and Astapor and Qarth.
01308	When this woman had grown old, Grazdan had purchased half a dozen young girls and commanded the crone to instruct them in the secrets of her craft.
01309	The old woman was dead now.
01310	The young ones, freed, had opened a shop by the harbor wall to sell their weavings.
01311	Grazdan zo Galare asked that he be granted a portion of their earnings.
01312	“They owe their skill to me,” he insisted.
01313	“I plucked them from the auction bloc and gave them to the loom.
01314	” Dany listened quietly, her face still.
01315	When he was done, she said, “What was the name of the old weaver?” “The slave?” Grazdan shifted his weight, frowning.
01316	“She was … Elza, it might have been.
01317	Or Ella.
01318	It was six years ago she died.
01319	I have owned so many slaves, Your Grace.
01320	” “Let us say Elza.
01321	Here is our ruling.
01322	From the girls, you shall have nothing.
01323	It was Elza who taught them weaving, not you.
01324	From you, the girls shall have a new loom, the finest coin can buy.
01325	That is for forgetting the name of the old woman.
01326	” Reznak would have summoned another tokar next, but Dany insisted that he call upon a freedman.
01327	Thereafter she alternated between the former masters and the former slaves.
01328	Many and more of the matters brought before her involved redress.
01329	Meereen had been sacked savagely after its fall.
01330	The stepped pyramids of the mighty had been spared the worst of the ravages, but the humbler parts of the city had been given over to an orgy of looting and killing as the city’s slaves rose up and the starving hordes who had followed her from Yunkai and Astapor poured through the broken gates.
01331	Her Unsullied had finally restored order, but the sack left a plague of problems in its wake.
01332	And so they came to see the queen.
01333	A rich woman came, whose husband and sons had died defending the city walls.
01334	During the sack she had fled to her brother in fear.
01335	When she returned, she found her house had been turned into a brothel.
01336	The whores had bedecked themselves in her jewels and clothes.
01337	She wanted her house back, and her jewels.
01338	“They can keep the clothes,” she allowed.
01339	Dany granted her the jewels but ruled the house was lost when she abandoned it.
01340	A former slave came, to accuse a certain noble of the Zhak.
01341	The man had recently taken to wife a freedwoman who had been the noble’s bed:warmer before the city fell.
01342	The noble had taken her maidenhood, used her for his pleasure, and gotten her with child.
01343	Her new husband wanted the noble gelded for the crime of rape, and he wanted a purse of gold as well, to pay him for raising the noble’s bastard as his own.
01344	Dany granted him the gold, but not the gelding.
01345	“When he lay with her, your wife was his property, to do with as he would.
01346	By law, there was no rape.
01347	” Her decision did not please him, she could see, but if she gelded every man who ever forced a bedslave, she would soon rule a city of eunuchs.
01348	A boy came, younger than Dany, slight and scarred, dressed up in a frayed grey tokar trailing silver fringe.
01349	His voice broke when he told of how two of his father’s household slaves had risen up the night the gate broke.
01350	One had slain his father, the other his elder brother.
01351	Both had raped his mother before killing her as well.
01352	The boy had escaped with no more than the scar upon his face, but one of the murderers was still living in his father’s house, and the other had joined the queen’s soldiers as one of the Mother’s Men.
01353	He wanted them both hanged.
01354	I am queen over a city built on dust and death.
01355	Dany had no choice but to deny him.
01356	She had declared a blanket pardon for all crimes committed during the sack.
01357	Nor would she punish slaves for rising up against their masters.
01358	When she told him, the boy rushed at her, but his feet tangled in his tokar and he went sprawling headlong on the purple marble.
01359	Strong Belwas was on him at once.
01360	The huge brown eunuch yanked him up one:handed and shook him like a mastiff with a rat.
01361	“Enough, Belwas,” Dany called.
01362	“Release him.
01363	” To the boy she said, “Treasure that tokar, for it saved your life.
01364	You are only a boy, so we will forget what happened here.
01365	You should do the same.
01366	” But as he left the boy looked back over his shoulder, and when she saw his eyes Dany thought, The Harpy has another Son.
01367	By midday Daenerys was feeling the weight of the crown upon her head, and the hardness of the bench beneath her.
01368	With so many still waiting on her pleasure, she did not stop to eat.
01369	Instead she dispatched Jhiqui to the kitchens for a platter of flatbread, olives, figs, and cheese.
01370	She nibbled whilst she listened, and sipped from a cup of watered wine.
01371	The figs were fine, the olives even finer, but the wine left a tart metallic aftertaste in her mouth.
01372	The small pale yellow grapes native to these regions produced a notably inferior vintage.
01373	We shall have no trade in wine.
01374	Besides, the Great Masters had burned the best arbors along with the olive trees.
01375	In the afternoon a sculptor came, proposing to replace the head of the great bronze harpy in the Plaza of Purification with one cast in Dany’s image.
01376	She denied him with as much courtesy as she could muster.
01377	A pike of unprecedented size had been caught in the Skahazadhan, and the fisherman wished to give it to the queen.
01378	She admired the fish extravagantly, rewarded the fisherman with a purse of silver, and sent the pike to her kitchens.
01379	A coppersmith had fashioned her a suit of burnished rings to wear to war.
01380	She accepted it with fulsome thanks:: it was lovely to behold, and all that burnished copper would flash prettily in the sun, though if actual battle threatened, she would sooner be clad in steel.
01381	Even a young girl who knew nothing of the ways of war knew that.
01382	The slippers the Butcher King had sent her had grown too uncomfortable.
01383	Dany kicked them off and sat with one foot tucked beneath her and the other swinging back and forth.
01384	It was not a very regal pose, but she was tired of being regal.
01385	The crown had given her a headache, and her buttocks had gone to sleep.
01386	“Ser Barristan,” she called, “I know what quality a king needs most.
01387	” “Courage, Your Grace?” “Cheeks like iron,” she teased.
01388	“All I do is sit.
01389	” “Your Grace takes too much on herself.
01390	You should allow your councillors to shoulder more of your burdens.
01391	” “I have too many councillors and too few cushions.
01392	” Dany turned to Reznak.
01393	“How many more?” “ Three:and:twenty, if it please Your Magnificence.
01394	With as many claims.
01395	” The seneschal consulted some papers.
01396	“One calf and three goats.
01397	The rest will be sheep or lambs, no doubt.
01398	” “ Three:and:twenty.
01399	” Dany sighed.
01400	“My dragons have developed a prodigious taste for mutton since we began to pay the shepherds for their kills.
01401	Have these claims been proven?” “Some men have brought burnt bones.
01402	” “Men make fires.
01403	Men cook mutton.
01404	Burnt bones prove nothing.
01405	Brown Ben says there are red wolves in the hills outside the city, and jack:als and wild dogs.
01406	Must we pay good silver for every lamb that goes astray between Yunkai and the Skahazadhan?” “No, Magnificence.
01407	” Reznak bowed.
01408	“Shall I send these rascals away, or will you want them scourged?” Daenerys shifted on the bench.
01409	“No man should ever fear to come to me.
01410	” Some claims were false, she did not doubt, but more were genuine.
01411	Her dragons had grown too large to be content with rats and cats and dogs.
01412	The more they eat, the larger they will grow, Ser Barristan had warned her, and the larger they grow, the more they’ll eat.
01413	Drogon especially ranged far afield and could easily devour a sheep a day.
01414	“Pay them for the value of their animals,” she told Reznak, “but henceforth claimants must present themselves at the Temple of the Graces and swear a holy oath before the gods of Ghis.
01415	” “It shall be done.
01416	” Reznak turned to the petitioners.
01417	“Her Magnificence the Queen has consented to compensate each of you for the animals you have lost,” he told them in the Ghiscari tongue.
01418	“Present yourselves to my factors on the morrow, and you shall be paid in coin or kind, as you prefer.
01419	” The pronouncement was received in sullen silence.
01420	You would think they might be happier, Dany thought.
01421	They have what they came for.
01422	Is there no way to please these people? One man lingered behind as the rest were filing out—a squat man with a windburnt face, shabbily dressed.
01423	His hair was a cap of coarse red:black wire cropped about his ears, and in one hand he held a sad cloth sack.
01424	He stood with his head down, gazing at the marble floor as if he had quite forgotten where he was.
01425	And what does this one want? Dany wondered.
01426	“All kneel for Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Khaleesi of Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Shackles, and Mother of Dragons,” cried Missandei in her high, sweet voice.
01427	As Dany stood, her tokar began to slip.
01428	She caught it and tugged it back in place.
01429	“You with the sack,” she called, “did you wish to speak with us? You may approach.
01430	” When he raised his head, his eyes were red and raw as open sores.
01431	Dany glimpsed Ser Barristan sliding closer, a white shadow at her side.
01432	The man approached in a stumbling shuffle, one step and then another, clutching his sack.
01433	Is he drunk, or ill? she wondered.
01434	There was dirt beneath his cracked yellow fingernails.
01435	“What is it?” Dany asked.
01436	“Do you have some grievance to lay before us, some petition? What would you have of us?” His tongue flicked nervously over chapped, cracked lips.
01437	“I … I brought …” “Bones?” she said, impatiently.
01438	“Burnt bones?” He lifted the sack, and spilled its contents on the marble.
01439	Bones they were, broken bones and blackened.
01440	The longer ones had been cracked open for their marrow.
01441	“It were the black one,” the man said, in a Ghiscari growl, “the winged shadow.
01442	He come down from the sky and … and …” No.
01443	Dany shivered.
01444	No, no, oh no.
01445	“Are you deaf, fool?” Reznak mo Reznak demanded of the man.
01446	“Did you not hear my pronouncement? See my factors on the morrow, and you shall be paid for your sheep.
01447	” “Reznak,” Ser Barristan said quietly, “hold your tongue and open your eyes.
01448	Those are no sheep bones.
01449	” No, Dany thought, those are the bones of a child.
01450	JON The white wolf raced through a black wood, beneath a pale cliff as tall as the sky.
01451	The moon ran with him, slipping through a tangle of bare branches overhead, across the starry sky.
01452	“Snow,” the moon murmured.
01453	The wolf made no answer.
01454	Snow crunched beneath his paws.
01455	The wind sighed through the trees.
01456	Far off, he could hear his packmates calling to him, like to like.
01457	They were hunting too.
01458	A wild rain lashed down upon his black brother as he tore at the flesh of an enormous goat, washing the blood from his side where the goat’s long horn had raked him.
01459	In another place, his little sister lifted her head to sing to the moon, and a hundred small grey cousins broke off their hunt to sing with her.
01460	The hills were warmer where they were, and full of food.
01461	Many a night his sister’s pack gorged on the flesh of sheep and cows and horses, the prey of men, and sometimes even on the flesh of man himself.
01462	“Snow,” the moon called down again, cackling.
01463	The white wolf padded along the man trail beneath the icy cliff.
01464	The taste of blood was on his tongue, and his ears rang to the song of the hundred cousins.
01465	Once they had been six, five whimpering blind in the snow beside their dead mother, sucking cool milk from her hard dead nipples whilst he crawled off alone.
01466	Four remained … and one the white wolf could no longer sense.
01467	“Snow,” the moon insisted.
01468	The white wolf ran from it, racing toward the cave of night where the sun had hidden, his breath frosting in the air.
01469	On starless nights the great cliff was as black as stone, a darkness towering high above the wide world, but when the moon came out it shimmered pale and icy as a frozen stream.
01470	The wolf’s pelt was thick and shaggy, but when the wind blew along the ice no fur could keep the chill out.
01471	On the other side the wind was colder still, the wolf sensed.
01472	That was where his brother was, the grey brother who smelled of summer.
01473	“Snow.
01474	” An icicle tumbled from a branch.
01475	The white wolf turned and bared his teeth.
01476	“Snow!” His fur rose bristling, as the woods dissolved around him.
01477	“Snow, snow, snow!” He heard the beat of wings.
01478	Through the gloom a raven flew.
01479	It landed on Jon Snow’s chest with a thump and a scrabbling of claws.
01480	“SNOW!” it screamed into his face.
01481	“I hear you.
01482	” The room was dim, his pallet hard.
01483	Grey light leaked through the shutters, promising another bleak cold day.
01484	“Is this how you woke Mormont? Get your feathers out of my face.
01485	” Jon wriggled an arm out from under his blankets to shoo the raven off.
01486	It was a big bird, old and bold and scruffy, utterly without fear.
01487	“Snow,” it cried, flapping to his bedpost.
01488	“Snow, snow.
01489	” Jon filled his fist with a pillow and let fly, but the bird took to the air.
01490	The pillow struck the wall and burst, scattering stuffing everywhere just as Dolorous Edd Tollett poked his head through the door.
01491	“Beg pardon,” he said, ignoring the flurry of feathers, “shall I fetch m’lord some breakfast?” “Corn,” cried the raven.
01492	“Corn, corn.
01493	” “Roast raven,” Jon suggested.
01494	“And half a pint of ale.
01495	” Having a steward fetch and serve for him still felt strange:: not long ago, it would have been him fetching breakfast for Lord Commander Mormont.
01496	“Three corns and one roast raven,” said Dolorous Edd.
01497	“Very good, m’lord, only Hobb’s made boiled eggs, black sausage, and apples stewed with prunes.
01498	The apples stewed with prunes are excellent, except for the prunes.
01499	I won’t eat prunes myself.
01500	Well, there was one time when Hobb chopped them up with chestnuts and carrots and hid them in a hen.
01501	Never trust a cook, my lord.
01502	They’ll prune you when you least expect it.
01503	” “Later.
01504	” Breakfast could wait:: Stannis could not.
01505	“Any trouble from the stockades last night?” “Not since you put guards on the guards, m’lord.
01506	” “Good.
01507	” A thousand wildlings had been penned up beyond the Wall, the captives Stannis Baratheon had taken when his knights had smashed Mance Rayder’s patchwork host.
01508	Many of the prisoners were women, and some of the guards had been sneaking them out to warm their beds.
01509	King’s men, queen’s men, it did not seem to matter:: a few black brothers had tried the same thing.
01510	Men were men, and these were the only women for a thousand leagues.
01511	“Two more wildlings turned up to surrender,” Edd went on.
01512	“A mother with a girl clinging to her skirts.
01513	She had a boy babe too, all swaddled up in fur, but he was dead.
01514	” “Dead,” said the raven.
01515	It was one of the bird’s favorite words.
01516	“Dead, dead, dead.
01517	” They had free folk drifting in most every night, starved half:frozen creatures who had run from the battle beneath the Wall only to crawl back when they realized there was no safe place to run to.
01518	“Was the mother questioned?” Jon asked.
01519	Stannis Baratheon had smashed Mance Rayder’s host and made the King:Beyond:the:Wall his captive … but the wildlings were still out there, the Weeper and Tormund Giantsbane and thousands more.
01520	“Aye, m’lord,” said Edd, “but all she knows is that she ran off during the battle and hid in the woods after.
01521	We filled her full of porridge, sent her to the pens, and burned the babe.
01522	” Burning dead children had ceased to trouble Jon Snow:: live ones were another matter.
01523	Two kings to wake the dragon.
01524	The father first and then the son, so both die kings.
01525	The words had been murmured by one of the queen’s men as Maester Aemon had cleaned his wounds.
01526	Jon had tried to dismiss them as his fever talking.
01527	Aemon had demurred.
01528	“There is power in a king’s blood,” the old maester had warned, “and better men than Stannis have done worse things than this.
01529	” The king can be harsh and unforgiving, aye, but a babe still on the breast? Only a monster would give a living child to the flames.
01530	Jon pissed in darkness, filling his chamber pot as the Old Bear’s raven muttered complaints.
01531	The wolf dreams had been growing stronger, and he found himself remembering them even when awake.
01532	Ghost knows that Grey Wind is dead.
01533	Robb had died at the Twins, betrayed by men he’d believed his friends, and his wolf had perished with him.
01534	Bran and Rickon had been murdered too, beheaded at the behest of Theon Greyjoy, who had once been their lord father’s ward … but if dreams did not lie, their direwolves had escaped.
01535	At Queenscrown, one had come out of the darkness to save Jon’s life.
01536	Summer, it had to be.
01537	His fur was grey, and Shaggydog is black.
01538	He wondered if some part of his dead brothers lived on inside their wolves.
01539	He filled his basin from the flagon of water beside his bed, washed his face and hands, donned a clean set of black woolens, laced up a black leather jerkin, and pulled on a pair of well:worn boots.
01540	Mormont’s raven watched with shrewd black eyes, then fluttered to the window.
01541	“Do you take me for your thrall?” When Jon folded back the window with its thick diamond:shaped panes of yellow glass, the chill of the morning hit him in the face.
01542	He took a breath to clear away the cobwebs of the night as the raven flapped away.
01543	That bird is too clever by half.
01544	It had been the Old Bear’s companion for long years, but that had not stopped it from eating Mormont’s face once he died.
01545	Outside his bedchamber a flight of steps descended to a larger room furnished with a scarred pinewood table and a dozen oak:and:leather chairs.
01546	With Stannis in the King’s Tower and the Lord Commander’s Tower burned to a shell, Jon had established himself in Donal Noye’s modest rooms behind the armory.
01547	In time, no doubt, he would need larger quarters, but for the moment these would serve whilst he accustomed himself to command.
01548	The grant that the king had presented him for signature was on the table beneath a silver drinking cup that had once been Donal Noye’s.
01549	The one:armed smith had left few personal effects: the cup, six pennies and a copper star, a niello brooch with a broken clasp, a musty brocade doublet that bore the stag of Storm’s End.
01550	His treasures were his tools, and the swords and knives he made.
01551	His life was at the forge.
01552	Jon moved the cup aside and read the parchment once again.
01553	If I put my seal to this, I will forever be remembered as the lord commander who gave away the Wall, he thought, but if I should refuse … Stannis Baratheon was proving to be a prickly guest, and a restless one.
01554	He had ridden down the kingsroad almost as far as Queenscrown, prowled through the empty hovels of Mole’s Town, inspected the ruined forts at Queensgate and Oakenshield.
01555	Each night he walked atop the Wall with Lady Melisandre, and during the days he visited the stockades, picking captives out for the red woman to question.
01556	He does not like to be balked.
01557	This would not be a pleasant morning, Jon feared.
01558	From the armory came a clatter of shields and swords, as the latest lot of boys and raw recruits armed themselves.
01559	He could hear the voice of Iron Emmett telling them to be quick about it.
01560	Cotter Pyke had not been pleased to lose him, but the young ranger had a gift for training men.
01561	He loves to fight, and he’ll teach his boys to love it too.
01562	Or so he hoped.
01563	Jon’s cloak hung on a peg by the door, his sword belt on another.
01564	He donned them both and made his way to the armory.
01565	The rug where Ghost slept was empty, he saw.
01566	Two guardsmen stood inside the doors, clad in black cloaks and iron halfhelms, spears in their hands.
01567	“Will m’lord be wanting a tail?” asked Garse.
01568	“I think I can find the King’s Tower by myself.
01569	” Jon hated having guards trailing after him everywhere he went.
01570	It made him feel like a mother duck leading a procession of ducklings.
01571	Iron Emmett’s lads were well at it in the yard, blunted swords slamming into shields and ringing against one another.
01572	Jon stopped to watch a moment as Horse pressed Hop:Robin back toward the well.
01573	Horse had the makings of a good fighter, he decided.
01574	He was strong and getting stronger, and his instincts were sound.
01575	Hop:Robin was another tale.
01576	His clubfoot was bad enough, but he was afraid of getting hit as well.
01577	Perhaps we can make a steward of him.
01578	The fight ended abruptly, with Hop:Robin on the ground.
01579	“Well fought,” Jon said to Horse, “but you drop your shield too low when pressing an attack.
01580	You will want to correct that, or it is like to get you killed.
01581	” “Yes, m’lord.
01582	I’ll keep it higher next time.
01583	” Horse pulled Hop:Robin to his feet, and the smaller boy made a clumsy bow.
01584	A few of Stannis’s knights were sparring on the far side of the yard.
01585	King’s men in one corner and queen’s men in another, Jon did not fail to note, but only a few.
01586	It’s too cold for most of them.
01587	As he strode past them, a booming voice called after him.
01588	“BOY! YOU THERE! BOY!” Boy was not the worst of the things that Jon Snow had been called since being chosen lord commander.
01589	He ignored it.
01590	“Snow,” the voice insisted, “Lord Commander.
01591	” This time he stopped.
01592	“Ser?” The knight overtopped him by six inches.
01593	“A man who bears Valyrian steel should use it for more than scratching his arse.
01594	” Jon had seen this one about the castle—a knight of great renown, to hear him tell it.
01595	During the battle beneath the Wall, Ser Godry Farring had slain a fleeing giant, pounding after him on horseback and driving a lance through his back, then dismounting to hack off the creature’s pitiful small head.
01596	The queen’s men had taken to calling him Godry the Giantslayer.
01597	Jon remembered Ygritte, crying.
01598	I am the last of the giants.
01599	“I use Longclaw when I must, ser.
01600	” “How well, though?” Ser Godry drew his own blade.
01601	“Show us.
01602	I promise not to hurt you, lad.
01603	” How kind of you.
01604	“Some other time, ser.
01605	I fear that I have other duties just now.
01606	” “You fear.
01607	I see that.
01608	” Ser Godry grinned at his friends.
01609	“He fears,” he repeated, for the slow ones.
01610	“You will excuse me.
01611	” Jon showed them his back.
01612	Castle Black seemed a bleak and forlorn place in the pale dawn light.
01613	My command, Jon Snow reflected ruefully, as much a ruin as it is a strong:hold.
01614	The Lord Commander’s Tower was a shell, the Common Hall a pile of blackened timbers, and Hardin’s Tower looked as if the next gust of wind would knock it over … though it had looked that way for years.
01615	Behind them rose the Wall: immense, forbidding, frigid, acrawl with builders pushing up a new switchback stair to join the remnants of the old.
01616	They worked from dawn to dusk.
01617	Without the stair, there was no way to reach the top of the Wall save by winch.
01618	That would not serve if the wildlings should attack again.
01619	Above the King’s Tower the great golden battle standard of House Baratheon cracked like a whip from the roof where Jon Snow had prowled with bow in hand not long ago, slaying Thenns and free folk beside Satin and Deaf Dick Follard.
01620	Two queen’s men stood shivering on the steps, their hands tucked up into their armpits and their spears leaning against the door.
01621	“Those cloth gloves will never serve,” Jon told them.
01622	“See Bowen Marsh on the morrow, and he’ll give you each a pair of leather gloves lined with fur.
01623	” “We will, m’lord, and thank you,” said the older guard.
01624	“That’s if our bloody hands aren’t froze off,” the younger added, his breath a pale mist.
01625	“I used to think that it got cold up in the Dornish Marches.
01626	What did I know?” Nothing, thought Jon Snow, the same as me.
01627	Halfway up the winding steps, he came upon Samwell Tarly, headed down.
01628	“Are you coming from the king?” Jon asked him.
01629	“Maester Aemon sent me with a letter.
01630	” “I see.
01631	” Some lords trusted their maesters to read their letters and convey the contents, but Stannis insisted on breaking the seals himself.
01632	“How did Stannis take it?” “Not happily, by his face.
01633	” Sam dropped his voice to a whisper.
01634	“I am not supposed to speak of it.
01635	” “Then don’t.
01636	” Jon wondered which of his father’s bannermen had refused King Stannis homage this time.
01637	He was quick enough to spread the word when Karhold declared for him.
01638	“How are you and your longbow getting on?” “I found a good book about archery.
01639	” Sam frowned.
01640	“Doing it is harder than reading about it, though.
01641	I get blisters.
01642	” “Keep at it.
01643	We may need your bow on the Wall if the Others turn up some dark night.
01644	” “Oh, I hope not.
01645	” More guards stood outside the king’s solar.
01646	“No arms are allowed in His Grace’s presence, my lord,” their serjeant said.
01647	“I’ll need that sword.
01648	Your knives as well.
01649	” It would do no good to protest, Jon knew.
01650	He handed them his weaponry.
01651	Within the solar the air was warm.
01652	Lady Melisandre was seated near the fire, her ruby glimmering against the pale skin of her throat.
01653	Ygritte had been kissed by fire:: the red priestess was fire, and her hair was blood and flame.
01654	Stannis stood behind the rough:hewn table where the Old Bear had once been wont to sit and take his meals.
01655	Covering the table was a large map of the north, painted on a ragged piece of hide.
01656	A tallow candle weighed down one end of it, a steel gauntlet the other.
01657	The king wore lambswool breeches and a quilted doublet, yet somehow he looked as stiff and uncomfortable as if he had been clad in plate and mail.
01658	His skin was pale leather, his beard cropped so short that it might have been painted on.
01659	A fringe about his temples was all that remained of his black hair.
01660	In his hand was a parchment with a broken seal of dark green wax.
01661	Jon took a knee.
01662	The king frowned at him, and rattled the parchment angrily.
01663	“Rise.
01664	Tell me, who is Lyanna Mormont?” “One of Lady Maege’s daughters, Sire.
01665	The youngest.
01666	She was named for my lord father’s sister.
01667	” “To curry your lord father’s favor, I don’t doubt.
01668	I know how that game is played.
01669	How old is this wretched girl child?” Jon had to think a moment.
01670	“Ten.
01671	Or near enough to make no matter.
01672	Might I know how she has offended Your Grace?” Stannis read from the letter.
01673	“Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is STARK.
01674	A girl of ten, you say, and she presumes to scold her lawful king.
01675	” His close:cropped beard lay like a shadow over his hollow cheeks.
01676	“See that you keep these tidings to yourself, Lord Snow.
01677	Karhold is with me, that is all the men need know.
01678	I will not have your brothers trading tales of how this child spat on me.
01679	” “As you command, Sire.
01680	” Maege Mormont had ridden south with Robb, Jon knew.
01681	Her eldest daughter had joined the Young Wolf’s host as well.
01682	Even if both of them had died, however, Lady Maege had other daughters, some with children of their own.
01683	Had they gone with Robb as well? Surely Lady Maege would have left at least one of the older girls behind as castellan.
01684	He did not understand why Lyanna should be writing Stannis, and could not help but wonder if the girl’s answer might have been different if the letter had been sealed with a direwolf instead of a crowned stag, and signed by Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell.
01685	It is too late for such misgivings.
01686	You made your choice.
01687	“Two score ravens were sent out,” the king complained, “yet we get no response but silence and defiance.
01688	Homage is the duty every leal subject owes his king.
01689	Yet your father’s bannermen all turn their back on me, save the Karstarks.
01690	Is Arnolf Karstark the only man of honor in the north?” Arnolf Karstark was the late Lord Rickard’s uncle.
01691	He had been made the castellan of Karhold when his nephew and his sons went south with Robb, and he had been the first to respond to King Stannis’s call for homage, with a raven declaring his allegiance.
01692	The Karstarks have no other choice, Jon might have said.
01693	Rickard Karstark had betrayed the direwolf and spilled the blood of lions.
01694	The stag was Karhold’s only hope.
01695	“In times as confused as these, even men of honor must wonder where their duty lies.
01696	Your Grace is not the only king in the realm demanding homage.
01697	” Lady Melisandre stirred.
01698	“Tell me, Lord Snow … where were these other kings when the wild people stormed your Wall?” “A thousand leagues away and deaf to our need,” Jon replied.
01699	“I have not forgotten that, my lady.
01700	Nor will I.
01701	But my father’s bannermen have wives and children to protect, and smallfolk who will die should they choose wrongly.
01702	His Grace asks much of them.
01703	Give them time, and you will have your answers.
01704	” “Answers such as this?” Stannis crushed Lyanna’s letter in his fist.
01705	“Even in the north men fear the wroth of Tywin Lannister.
01706	Boltons make bad enemies as well.
01707	It is not happenstance that put a flayed man on their banners.
01708	They north rode with Robb, bled with him, died for him.
01709	They have supped on grief and death, and now you come to offer them another serving.
01710	Do you blame them if they hang back? Forgive me, Your Grace, but some will look at you and see only another doomed pretender.
01711	” “If His Grace is doomed, your realm is doomed as well,” said Lady Melisandre.
01712	“Remember that, Lord Snow.
01713	It is the one true king of Westeros who stands before you.
01714	” Jon kept his face a mask.
01715	“As you say, my lady.
01716	” Stannis snorted.
01717	“You spend your words as if every one were a golden dragon.
01718	I wonder, how much gold do you have laid by?” “Gold?” Are those the dragons the red woman means to wake? Dragons made of gold? “Such taxes as we collect are paid in kind, Your Grace.
01719	The Watch is rich in turnips but poor in coin.
01720	” “Turnips are not like to appease Salladhor Saan.
01721	I require gold or silver.
01722	” “For that, you need White Harbor.
01723	The city cannot compare to Old:town or King’s Landing, but it is still a thriving port.
01724	Lord Manderly is the richest of my lord father’s bannermen.
01725	” “Lord Too:Fat:to:Sit:a:Horse.
01726	” The letter that Lord Wyman Manderly had sent back from White Harbor had spoken of his age and infirmity, and little more.
01727	Stannis had commanded Jon not to speak of that one either.
01728	“Perhaps his lordship would fancy a wildling wife,” said Lady Melisandre.
01729	“Is this fat man married, Lord Snow?” “His lady wife is long dead.
01730	Lord Wyman has two grown sons, and grandchildren by the elder.
01731	And he is too fat to sit a horse, thirty stone at least.
01732	Val would never have him.
01733	” “Just once you might try to give me an answer that would please me, Lord Snow,” the king grumbled.
01734	“I would hope the truth would please you, Sire.
01735	Your men call Val a princess, but to the free folk she is only the sister of their king’s dead wife.
01736	If you force her to marry a man she does not want, she is like to slit his throat on their wedding night.
01737	Even if she accepts her husband, that does not mean the wildlings will follow him, or you.
01738	The only man who can bind them to your cause is Mance Rayder.
01739	” “I know that,” Stannis said, unhappily.
01740	“I have spent hours speaking with the man.
01741	He knows much and more of our true enemy, and there is cunning in him, I’ll grant you.
01742	Even if he were to renounce his kingship, though, the man remains an oathbreaker.
01743	Suffer one deserter to live, and you encourage others to desert.
01744	No.
01745	Laws should be made of iron, not of pudding.
01746	Mance Rayder’s life is forfeit by every law of the Seven Kingdoms.
01747	” “The law ends at the Wall, Your Grace.
01748	You could make good use of Mance.
01749	” “I mean to.
01750	I’ll burn him, and the north will see how I deal with turncloaks and traitors.
01751	I have other men to lead the wildlings.
01752	And I have Rayder’s son, do not forget.
01753	Once the father dies, his whelp will be the King:Beyond:the:Wall.
01754	” “Your Grace is mistaken.
01755	” You know nothing, Jon Snow, Ygritte used to say, but he had learned.
01756	“The babe is no more a prince than Val is a princess.
01757	You do not become King:Beyond:the:Wall because your father was.
01758	” “Good,” said Stannis, “for I will suffer no other kings in Westeros.
01759	Have you signed the grant?” “No, Your Grace.
01760	” And now it comes.
01761	Jon closed his burned fingers and opened them again.
01762	“You ask too much.
01763	” “Ask? I asked you to be Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.
01764	I require these castles.
01765	” “We have ceded you the Nightfort.
01766	” “Rats and ruins.
01767	It is a niggard’s gift that costs the giver nothing.
01768	Your own man Yarwyck says it will be half a year before the castle can be made fit for habitation.
01769	” “The other forts are no better.
01770	” “I know that.
01771	It makes no matter.
01772	They are all we have.
01773	There are nineteen forts along the Wall, and you have men in only three of them.
01774	I mean to have every one of them garrisoned again before the year is out.
01775	” “I have no quarrel with that, Sire, but it is being said that you also mean to grant these castles to your knights and lords, to hold as their own seats as vassals to Your Grace.
01776	” “Kings are expected to be open:handed to their followers.
01777	Did Lord Eddard teach his bastard nothing? Many of my knights and lords abandoned rich lands and stout castles in the south.
01778	Should their loyalty go unrewarded?” “If Your Grace wishes to lose all of my lord father’s bannermen, there is no more certain way than by giving northern halls to southron lords.
01779	” “How can I lose men I do not have? I had hoped to bestow Winterfell on a northman, you may recall.
01780	A son of Eddard Stark.
01781	He threw my offer in my face.
01782	” Stannis Baratheon with a grievance was like a mastiff with a bone:: he gnawed it down to splinters.
01783	“By right Winterfell should go to my sister Sansa.
01784	” “Lady Lannister, you mean? Are you so eager to see the Imp perched on your father’s seat? I promise you, that will not happen whilst I live, Lord Snow.
01785	” Jon knew better than to press the point.
01786	“Sire, some claim that you mean to grant lands and castles to Rattleshirt and the Magnar of Thenn.
01787	” “Who told you that?” The talk was all over Castle Black.
01788	“If you must know, I had the tale from Gilly.
01789	” “Who is Gilly?” “The wet nurse,” said Lady Melisandre.
01790	“Your Grace gave her freedom of the castle.
01791	” “Not for running tales.
01792	She’s wanted for her teats, not for her tongue.
01793	I’ll have more milk from her, and fewer messages.
01794	” “Castle Black needs no useless mouths,” Jon agreed.
01795	“I am sending Gilly south on the next ship out of Eastwatch.
01796	” Melisandre touched the ruby at her neck.
01797	“Gilly is giving suck to Dalla’s son as well as her own.
01798	It seems cruel of you to part our little prince from his milk brother, my lord.
01799	” Careful now, careful.
01800	“Mother’s milk is all they share.
01801	Gilly’s son is larger and more robust.
01802	He kicks the prince and pinches him, and shoves him from the breast.
01803	Craster was his father, a cruel man and greedy, and blood tells.
01804	” The king was confused.
01805	“I thought the wet nurse was this man Craster’s daughter?” “Wife and daughter both, Your Grace.
01806	Craster married all his daughters.
01807	Gilly’s boy was the fruit of their union.
01808	” “Her own father got this child on her?” Stannis sounded shocked.
01809	“We are well rid of her, then.
01810	I will not suffer such abominations here.
01811	This is not King’s Landing.
01812	” “I can find another wet nurse.
01813	If there’s none amongst the wildlings, I will send to the mountain clans.
01814	Until such time, goat’s milk should suffice for the boy, if it please Your Grace.
01815	” “Poor fare for a prince … but better than whore’s milk, aye.
01816	” Stannis drummed his fingers on the map.
01817	“If we may return to the matter of these forts …” “Your Grace,” said Jon, with chilly courtesy, “I have housed your men and fed them, at dire cost to our winter stores.
01818	I have clothed them so they would not freeze.
01819	” Stannis was not appeased.
01820	“Aye, you’ve shared your salt pork and porridge, and you’ve thrown us some black rags to keep us warm.
01821	Rags the wildlings would have taken off your corpses if I had not come north.
01822	” Jon ignored that.
01823	“I have given you fodder for your horses, and once the stair is done I will lend you builders to restore the Nightfort.
01824	I have even agreed to allow you to settle wildlings on the Gift, which was given to the Night’s Watch in perpetuity.
01825	” “You offer me empty lands and desolations, yet deny me the castles I require to reward my lords and bannermen.
01826	” “The Night’s Watch built those castles …” “And the Night’s Watch abandoned them.
01827	” “… to defend the Wall,” Jon finished stubbornly, “not as seats for southron lords.
01828	The stones of those forts are mortared with the blood and bones of my brothers, long dead.
01829	I cannot give them to you.
01830	” “Cannot or will not?” The cords in the king’s neck stood out sharp as swords.
01831	“I offered you a name.
01832	” “I have a name, Your Grace.
01833	” “Snow.
01834	Was ever a name more ill:omened?” Stannis touched his sword hilt.
01835	“Just who do you imagine that you are?” “The watcher on the walls.
01836	The sword in the darkness.
01837	” “Don’t prate your words at me.
01838	” Stannis drew the blade he called Lightbringer.
01839	“Here is your sword in the darkness.
01840	” Light rippled up and down the blade, now red, now yellow, now orange, painting the king’s face in harsh, bright hues.
01841	“Even a green boy should be able to see that.
01842	Are you blind?” “No, Sire.
01843	I agree these castles must be garrisoned—” “The boy commander agrees.
01844	How fortunate.
01845	” “—by the Night’s Watch.
01846	” “You do not have the men.
01847	” “Then give me men, Sire.
01848	I will provide officers for each of the abandoned forts, seasoned commanders who know the Wall and the lands beyond, and how best to survive the coming winter.
01849	In return for all we’ve given you, grant me the men to fill out the garrisons.
01850	Men:at:arms, cross:bowmen, raw boys.
01851	I will even take your wounded and infirm.
01852	” Stannis stared at him incredulously, then gave a bark of laughter.
01853	“You are bold enough, Snow, I grant you that, but you’re mad if you think my men will take the black.
01854	” “They can wear any color cloak they choose, so long as they obey my officers as they would your own.
01855	” The king was unmoved.
01856	“I have knights and lords in my service, scions of noble Houses old in honor.
01857	They cannot be expected to serve under poachers, peasants, and murderers.
01858	” Or bastards, Sire? “Your own Hand is a smuggler.
01859	” “Was a smuggler.
01860	I shortened his fingers for that.
01861	They tell me that you are the nine:hundred:ninety:eighth man to command the Night’s Watch, Lord Snow.
01862	What do you think the nine:hundred:ninety:ninth might say about these castles? The sight of your head on a spike might inspire him to be more helpful.
01863	” The king laid his bright blade down on the map, along the Wall, its steel shimmering like sunlight on water.
01864	“You are only lord commander by my sufferance.
01865	You would do well to remember that.
01866	” “I am lord commander because my brothers chose me.
01867	” There were mornings when Jon Snow did not quite believe it himself, when he woke up thinking surely this was some mad dream.
01868	It’s like putting on new clothes, Sam had told him.
01869	The fit feels strange at first, but once you’ve worn them for a while you get to feeling comfortable.
01870	“Alliser Thorne complains about the manner of your choosing, and I cannot say he does not have a grievance.
01871	” The map lay between them like a battleground, drenched by the colors of the glowing sword.
01872	“The count was done by a blind man with your fat friend by his elbow.
01873	And Slynt names you a turncloak.
01874	” And who would know one better than Slynt? “A turncloak would tell you what you wished to hear and betray you later.
01875	Your Grace knows that I was fairly chosen.
01876	My father always said you were a just man.
01877	” Just but harsh had been Lord Eddard’s exact words, but Jon did not think it would be wise to share that.
01878	“Lord Eddard was no friend to me, but he was not without some sense.
01879	He would have given me these castles.
01880	” Never.
01881	“I cannot speak to what my father might have done.
01882	I took an oath, Your Grace.
01883	The Wall is mine.
01884	” “For now.
01885	We will see how well you hold it.
01886	” Stannis pointed at him.
01887	“Keep your ruins, as they mean so much to you.
01888	I promise you, though, if any remain empty when the year is out, I will take them with your leave or without it.
01889	And if even one should fall to the foe, your head will soon follow.
01890	Now get out.
01891	” Lady Melisandre rose from her place near the hearth.
01892	“With your leave, Sire, I will show Lord Snow back to his chambers.
01893	” “Why? He knows the way.
01894	” Stannis waved them both away.
01895	“Do what you will.
01896	Devan, food.
01897	Boiled eggs and lemon water.
01898	” After the warmth of the king’s solar, the turnpike stair felt bone:chillingly cold.
01899	“Wind’s rising, m’lady,” the serjeant warned Melisandre as he handed Jon back his weapons.
01900	“You might want a warmer cloak.
01901	” “I have my faith to warm me.
01902	” The red woman walked beside Jon down the steps.
01903	“His Grace is growing fond of you.
01904	” “I can tell.
01905	He only threatened to behead me twice.
01906	” Melisandre laughed.
01907	“It is his silences you should fear, not his words.
01908	” As they stepped out into the yard, the wind filled Jon’s cloak and sent it flapping against her.
01909	The red priestess brushed the black wool aside and slipped her arm through his.
01910	“It may be that you are not wrong about the wildling king.
01911	I shall pray for the Lord of Light to send me guidance.
01912	When I gaze into the flames, I can see through stone and earth, and find the truth within men’s souls.
01913	I can speak to kings long dead and children not yet born, and watch the years and seasons flicker past, until the end of days.
01914	” “Are your fires never wrong?” “Never … though we priests are mortal and sometimes err, mistaking this must come for this may come.
01915	” Jon could feel her heat, even through his wool and boiled leather.
01916	The sight of them arm in arm was drawing curious looks.
01917	They will be whispering in the barracks tonight.
01918	“If you can truly see the morrow in your flames, tell me when and where the next wildling attack will come.
01919	” He slipped his arm free.
01920	“R’hllor sends us what visions he will, but I shall seek for this man Tormund in the flames.
01921	” Melisandre’s red lips curled into a smile.
01922	“I have seen you in my fires, Jon Snow.
01923	” “Is that a threat, my lady? Do you mean to burn me too?” “You mistake my meaning.
01924	” She gave him a searching look.
01925	“I fear that I make you uneasy, Lord Snow.
01926	” Jon did not deny it.
01927	“The Wall is no place for a woman.
01928	” “You are wrong.
01929	I have dreamed of your Wall, Jon Snow.
01930	Great was the lore that raised it, and great the spells locked beneath its ice.
01931	We walk beneath one of the hinges of the world.
01932	” Melisandre gazed up at it, her breath a warm moist cloud in the air.
01933	“This is my place as it is yours, and soon enough you may have grave need of me.
01934	Do not refuse my friendship, Jon.
01935	I have seen you in the storm, hard:pressed, with enemies on every side.
01936	You have so many enemies.
01937	Shall I tell you their names?” “I know their names.
01938	” “Do not be so certain.
01939	” The ruby at Melisandre’s throat gleamed red.
01940	“It is not the foes who curse you to your face that you must fear, but those who smile when you are looking and sharpen their knives when you turn your back.
01941	You would do well to keep your wolf close beside you.
01942	Ice, I see, and daggers in the dark.
01943	Blood frozen red and hard, and naked steel.
01944	It was very cold.
01945	” “It is always cold on the Wall.
01946	” “You think so?” “I know so, my lady.
01947	” “Then you know nothing, Jon Snow,” she whispered.
01948	BRAN Are we there yet? Bran never said the words aloud, but they were often on his lips as their ragged company trudged through groves of ancient oaks and towering grey:green sentinels, past gloomy soldier pines and bare brown chestnut trees.
01949	Are we near? the boy would wonder, as Hodor clambered up a stony slope, or descended into some dark crevice where drifts of dirty snow cracked beneath his feet.
01950	How much farther? he would think, as the great elk splashed across a half:frozen stream.
01951	How much longer? It’s so cold.
01952	Where is the three:eyed crow? Swaying in his wicker basket on Hodor’s back, the boy hunched down, ducking his head as the big stableboy passed beneath the limb of an oak.
01953	The snow was falling again, wet and heavy.
01954	Hodor walked with one eye frozen shut, his thick brown beard a tangle of hoarfrost, icicles drooping from the ends of his bushy mustache.
01955	One gloved hand still clutched the rusty iron longsword he had taken from the crypts below Winterfell, and from time to time he would lash out at a branch, knocking loose a spray of snow.
01956	“Hod:d:d:dor,” he would mutter, his teeth chattering.
01957	The sound was strangely reassuring.
01958	On their journey from Winterfell to the Wall, Bran and his companions had made the miles shorter by talking and telling tales, but it was different here.
01959	Even Hodor felt it.
01960	His hodors came less often than they had south of the Wall.
01961	There was a stillness to this wood like nothing Bran had ever known before.
01962	Before the snows began, the north wind would swirl around them and clouds of dead brown leaves would kick up from the ground with a faint small rustling sound that reminded him of roaches scurrying in a cupboard, but now all the leaves were buried under a blanket of white.
01963	From time to time a raven would fly overhead, big black wings slapping against the cold air.
01964	Elsewise the world was silent.
01965	Just ahead, the elk wove between the snowdrifts with his head down, his huge rack of antlers crusted with ice.
01966	The ranger sat astride his broad back, grim and silent.
01967	Coldhands was the name that the fat boy Sam had given him, for though the ranger’s face was pale, his hands were black and hard as iron, and cold as iron too.
01968	The rest of him was wrapped in layers of wool and boiled leather and ringmail, his features shadowed by his hooded cloak and a black woolen scarf about the lower half of his face.
01969	Behind the ranger, Meera Reed wrapped her arms around her brother, to shelter him from the wind and cold with the warmth of her own body.
01970	A crust of frozen snot had formed below Jojen’s nose, and from time to time he shivered violently.
01971	He looks so small, Bran thought, as he watched him sway.
01972	He looks smaller than me now, and weaker too, and I’m the cripple.
01973	Summer brought up the rear of their little band.
01974	The direwolf’s breath frosted the forest air as he padded after them, still limping on the hind leg that had taken the arrow back at Queenscrown.
01975	Bran felt the pain of the old wound whenever he slipped inside the big wolf’s skin.
01976	Of late Bran wore Summer’s body more often than his own:: the wolf felt the bite of the cold, despite the thickness of his fur, but he could see farther and hear better and smell more than the boy in the basket, bundled up like a babe in swaddling clothes.
01977	Other times, when he was tired of being a wolf, Bran slipped into Hodor’s skin instead.
01978	The gentle giant would whimper when he felt him, and thrash his shaggy head from side to side, but not as violently as he had the first time, back at Queenscrown.
01979	He knows it’s me, the boy liked to tell himself.
01980	He’s used to me by now.
01981	Even so, he never felt comfortable inside Hodor’s skin.
01982	The big stableboy never understood what was happening, and Bran could taste the fear at the back of his mouth.
01983	It was better inside Summer.
01984	I am him, and he is me.
01985	He feels what I feel.
01986	Sometimes Bran could sense the direwolf sniffing after the elk, wondering if he could bring the great beast down.
01987	Summer had grown accustomed to horses at Winterfell, but this was an elk and elk were prey.
01988	The direwolf could sense the warm blood coursing beneath the elk’s shaggy hide.
01989	Just the smell was enough to make the slaver run from between his jaws, and when it did Bran’s mouth would water at the thought of rich, dark meat.
01990	From a nearby oak a raven quorked, and Bran heard the sound of wings as another of the big black birds flapped down to land beside it.
01991	By day only half a dozen ravens stayed with them, flitting from tree to tree or riding on the antlers of the elk.
01992	The rest of the murder flew ahead or lingered behind.
01993	But when the sun sank low they would return, descending from the sky on night:black wings until every branch of every tree was thick with them for yards around.
01994	Some would fly to the ranger and mutter at him, and it seemed to Bran that he understood their quorks and squawks.
01995	They are his eyes and ears.
01996	They scout for him, and whisper to him of dangers ahead and behind.
01997	As now.
01998	The elk stopped suddenly, and the ranger vaulted lightly from his back to land in knee:deep snow.
01999	Summer growled at him, his fur bristling.
02000	The direwolf did not like the way that Coldhands smelled.
02001	Dead meat, dry blood, a faint whiff of rot.
02002	And cold.
02003	Cold over all.
02004	“What is it?” Meera wanted to know.
02005	“Behind us,” Coldhands announced, his voice muffled by the black wool scarf across his nose and mouth.
02006	“Wolves?” Bran asked.
02007	They had known for days that they were being followed.
02008	Every night they heard the mournful howling of the pack, and every night the wolves seemed a little closer.
02009	Hunters, and hungry.
02010	They can smell how weak we are.
02011	Often Bran woke shivering hours before the dawn, listening to the sound of them calling to one another in the distance as he waited for the sun to rise.
02012	If there are wolves, there must be prey, he used to think, until it came to him that they were the prey.
02013	The ranger shook his head.
02014	“Men.
02015	The wolves still keep their distance.
02016	These men are not so shy.
02017	” Meera Reed pushed back her hood.
02018	The wet snow that had covered it tumbled to the ground with a soft thump.
02019	“How many men? Who are they?” “Foes.
02020	I’ll deal with them.
02021	” “I’ll come with you.
02022	” “You’ll stay.
02023	The boy must be protected.
02024	There is a lake ahead, hard frozen.
02025	When you come on it, turn north and follow the shoreline.
02026	You’ll come to a fishing village.
02027	Take refuge there until I can catch up with you.
02028	” Bran thought that Meera meant to argue until her brother said, “Do as he says.
02029	He knows this land.
02030	” Jojen’s eyes were a dark green, the color of moss, but heavy with a weariness that Bran had never seen in them before.
02031	The little grandfather.
02032	South of the Wall, the boy from the crannogs had seemed to be wise beyond his years, but up here he was as lost and frightened as the rest of them.
02033	Even so, Meera always listened to him.
02034	That was still true.
02035	Coldhands slipped between the trees, back the way they’d come, with four ravens flapping after him.
02036	Meera watched him go, her cheeks red with cold, breath puffing from her nostrils.
02037	She pulled her hood back up and gave the elk a nudge, and their trek resumed.
02038	Before they had gone twenty yards, though, she turned to glance behind them and said, “Men, he says.
02039	What men? Does he mean wildlings? Why won’t he say?” “He said he’d go and deal with them,” said Bran.
02040	“He said, aye.
02041	He said he would take us to this three:eyed crow too.
02042	That river we crossed this morning is the same one we crossed four days ago, I swear.
02043	We’re going in circles.
02044	” “Rivers turn and twist,” Bran said uncertainly, “and where there’s lakes and hills, you need to go around.
02045	” “There’s been too much going around,” Meera insisted, “and too many secrets.
02046	I don’t like it.
02047	I don’t like him.
02048	And I don’t trust him.
02049	Those hands of his are bad enough.
02050	He hides his face, and will not speak a name.
02051	Who is he? What is he? Anyone can put on a black cloak.
02052	Anyone, or any thing.
02053	He does not eat, he never drinks, he does not seem to feel the cold.
02054	” It’s true.
02055	Bran had been afraid to speak of it, but he had noticed.
02056	Whenever they took shelter for the night, while he and Hodor and the Reeds huddled together for warmth, the ranger kept apart.
02057	Sometimes Cold:hands closed his eyes, but Bran did not think he slept.
02058	And there was something else … “The scarf.
02059	” Bran glanced about uneasily, but there was not a raven to be seen.
02060	All the big black birds had left them when the ranger did.
02061	No one was listening.
02062	Even so, he kept his voice low.
02063	“The scarf over his mouth, it never gets all hard with ice, like Hodor’s beard.
02064	Not even when he talks.
02065	” Meera gave him a sharp look.
02066	“You’re right.
02067	We’ve never seen his breath, have we?” “No.
02068	” A puff of white heralded each of Hodor’s hodors.
02069	When Jojen or his sister spoke, their words could be seen too.
02070	Even the elk left a warm fog upon the air when he exhaled.
02071	“If he does not breathe …” Bran found himself remembering the tales Old Nan had told him when he was a babe.
02072	Beyond the Wall the monsters live, the giants and the ghouls, the stalking shadows and the dead that walk, she would say, tucking him in beneath his scratchy woolen blanket, but they cannot pass so long as the Wall stands strong and the men of the Night’s Watch are true.
02073	So go to sleep, my little Brandon, my baby boy, and dream sweet dreams.
02074	There are no monsters here.
02075	The ranger wore the black of the Night’s Watch, but what if he was not a man at all? What if he was some monster, taking them to the other monsters to be devoured? “The ranger saved Sam and the girl from the wights,” Bran said, hesitantly, “and he’s taking me to the three:eyed crow.
02076	” “Why won’t this three:eyed crow come to us? Why couldn’t he meet us at the Wall? Crows have wings.
02077	My brother grows weaker every day.
02078	How long can we go on?” Jojen coughed.
02079	“Until we get there.
02080	” They came upon the promised lake not long after, and turned north as the ranger had bid them.
02081	That was the easy part.
02082	The water was frozen, and the snow had been falling for so long that Bran had lost count of the days, turning the lake into a vast white wilderness.
02083	Where the ice was flat and the ground was bumpy, the going was easy, but where the wind had pushed the snow up into ridges, sometimes it was hard to tell where the lake ended and the shore began.
02084	Even the trees were not as infallible a guide as they might have hoped, for there were wooded islands in the lake, and wide areas ashore where no trees grew.
02085	The elk went where he would, regardless of the wishes of Meera and Jojen on his back.
02086	Mostly he stayed beneath the trees, but where the shore curved away westward he would take the more direct path across the frozen lake, shouldering through snowdrifts taller than Bran as the ice crackled underneath his hooves.
02087	Out there the wind was stronger, a cold north wind that howled across the lake, knifed through their layers of wool and leather, and set them all to shivering.
02088	When it blew into their faces, it would drive the snow into their eyes and leave them as good as blind.
02089	Hours passed in silence.
02090	Ahead, shadows began to steal between the trees, the long fingers of the dusk.
02091	Dark came early this far north.
02092	Bran had come to dread that.
02093	Each day seemed shorter than the last, and where the days were cold, the nights were bitter cruel.
02094	Meera halted them again.
02095	“We should have come on the village by now.
02096	” Her voice sounded hushed and strange.
02097	“Could we have passed it?” Bran asked.
02098	“I hope not.
02099	We need to find shelter before nightfall.
02100	” She was not wrong.
02101	Jojen’s lips were blue, Meera’s cheeks dark red.
02102	Bran’s own face had gone numb.
02103	Hodor’s beard was solid ice.
02104	Snow caked his legs almost to the knee, and Bran had felt him stagger more than once.
02105	No one was as strong as Hodor, no one.
02106	If even his great strength was failing … “Summer can find the village,” Bran said suddenly, his words misting in the air.
02107	He did not wait to hear what Meera might say, but closed his eyes and let himself flow from his broken body.
02108	As he slipped inside Summer’s skin, the dead woods came to sudden life.
02109	Where before there had been silence, now he heard: wind in the trees, Hodor’s breathing, the elk pawing at the ground in search of fodder.
02110	Familiar scents filled his nostrils: wet leaves and dead grass, the rotted carcass of a squirrel decaying in the brush, the sour stink of man:sweat, the musky odor of the elk.
02111	Food.
02112	Meat.
02113	The elk sensed his interest.
02114	He turned his head toward the direwolf, wary, and lowered his great antlers.
02115	He is not prey, the boy whispered to the beast who shared his skin.
02116	Leave him.
02117	Run.
02118	Summer ran.
02119	Across the lake he raced, his paws kicking up sprays of snow behind him.
02120	The trees stood shoulder to shoulder, like men in a battle line, all cloaked in white.
02121	Over roots and rocks the direwolf sped, through a drift of old snow, the crust crackling beneath his weight.
02122	His paws grew wet and cold.
02123	The next hill was covered with pines, and the sharp scent of their needles filled the air.
02124	When he reached the top, he turned in a circle, sniffing at the air, then raised his head and howled.
02125	The smells were there.
02126	Mansmells.
02127	Ashes, Bran thought, old and faint, but ashes.
02128	It was the smell of burnt wood, soot, and charcoal.
02129	A dead fire.
02130	He shook the snow off his muzzle.
02131	The wind was gusting, so the smells were hard to follow.
02132	The wolf turned this way and that, sniffing.
02133	All around were heaps of snow and tall trees garbed in white.
02134	The wolf let his tongue loll out between his teeth, tasting the frigid air, his breath misting as snow:flakes melted on his tongue.
02135	When he trotted toward the scent, Hodor lumbered after him at once.
02136	The elk took longer to decide, so Bran returned reluctantly to his own body and said, “That way.
02137	Follow Summer.
02138	I smelled it.
02139	” As the first sliver of a crescent moon came peeking through the clouds, they finally stumbled into the village by the lake.
02140	They had almost walked straight through it.
02141	From the ice, the village looked no different than a dozen other spots along the lakeshore.
02142	Buried under drifts of snow, the round stone houses could just as easily have been boulders or hillocks or fallen logs, like the deadfall that Jojen had mistaken for a building the day before, until they dug down into it and found only broken branches and rotting logs.
02143	The village was empty, abandoned by the wildlings who had once lived there, like all the other villages they had passed.
02144	Some had been burned, as if the inhabitants had wanted to make certain they could not come creeping back, but this one had been spared the torch.
02145	Beneath the snow they found a dozen huts and a longhall, with its sod roof and thick walls of rough:hewn logs.
02146	“At least we will be out of the wind,” Bran said.
02147	“Hodor,” said Hodor.
02148	Meera slid down from the elk’s back.
02149	She and her brother helped lift Bran out of the wicker basket.
02150	“Might be the wildlings left some food behind,” she said.
02151	That proved a forlorn hope.
02152	Inside the longhall they found the ashes of a fire, floors of hard:packed dirt, a chill that went bone deep.
02153	But at least they had a roof above their heads and log walls to keep the wind off.
02154	A stream ran nearby, covered with a film of ice.
02155	The elk had to crack it with his hoof to drink.
02156	Once Bran and Jojen and Hodor were safely settled, Meera fetched back some chunks of broken ice for them to suck on.
02157	The melting water was so cold it made Bran shudder.
02158	Summer did not follow them into the longhall.
02159	Bran could feel the big wolf’s hunger, a shadow of his own.
02160	“Go hunt,” he told him, “but you leave the elk alone.
02161	” Part of him was wishing he could go hunting too.
02162	Perhaps he would, later.
02163	Supper was a fistful of acorns, crushed and pounded into paste, so bitter that Bran gagged as he tried to keep it down.
02164	Jojen Reed did not even make the attempt.
02165	Younger and frailer than his sister, he was growing weaker by the day.
02166	“Jojen, you have to eat,” Meera told him.
02167	“Later.
02168	I just want to rest.
02169	” Jojen smiled a wan smile.
02170	“This is not the day I die, sister.
02171	I promise you.
02172	” “You almost fell off the elk.
02173	” “Almost.
02174	I am cold and hungry, that’s all.
02175	” “Then eat.
02176	” “Crushed acorns? My belly hurts, but that will only make it worse.
02177	Leave me be, sister.
02178	I’m dreaming of roast chicken.
02179	” “Dreams will not sustain you.
02180	Not even greendreams.
02181	” “Dreams are what we have.
02182	” All we have.
02183	The last of the food that they had brought from the south was ten days gone.
02184	Since then hunger walked beside them day and night.
02185	Even Summer could find no game in these woods.
02186	They lived on crushed acorns and raw fish.
02187	The woods were full of frozen streams and cold black lakes, and Meera was as good a fisher with her three:pronged frog spear as most men were with hook and line.
02188	Some days her lips were blue with cold by the time she waded back to them with her catch wriggling on her tines.
02189	It had been three days since Meera caught a fish, however.
02190	Bran’s belly felt so hollow it might have been three years.
02191	After they choked down their meagre supper, Meera sat with her back against a wall, sharpening her dagger on a whetstone.
02192	Hodor squatted down beside the door, rocking back and forth on his haunches and muttering, “Hodor, hodor, hodor.
02193	” Bran closed his eyes.
02194	It was too cold to talk, and they dare not light a fire.
02195	Coldhands had warned them against that.
02196	These woods are not as empty as you think, he had said.
02197	You cannot know what the light might summon from the darkness.
02198	The memory made him shiver, despite the warmth of Hodor beside him.
02199	Sleep would not come, could not come.
02200	Instead there was wind, the biting cold, moonlight on snow, and fire.
02201	He was back inside Summer, long leagues away, and the night was rank with the smell of blood.
02202	The scent was strong.
02203	A kill, not far.
02204	The flesh would still be warm.
02205	Slaver ran between his teeth as the hunger woke inside him.
02206	Not elk.
02207	Not deer.
02208	Not this.
02209	The direwolf moved toward the meat, a gaunt grey shadow sliding from tree to tree, through pools of moonlight and over mounds of snow.
02210	The wind gusted around him, shifting.
02211	He lost the scent, found it, then lost it again.
02212	As he searched for it once more, a distant sound made his ears prick up.
02213	Wolf, he knew at once.
02214	Summer stalked toward the sound, wary now.
02215	Soon enough the scent of blood was back, but now there were other smells: piss and dead skins, bird shit, feathers, and wolf, wolf, wolf.
02216	A pack.
02217	He would need to fight for his meat.
02218	They smelled him too.
02219	As he moved out from amongst the darkness of the trees into the bloody glade, they were watching him.
02220	The female was chewing on a leather boot that still had half a leg in it, but she let it fall at his approach.
02221	The leader of the pack, an old male with a grizzled white muzzle and a blind eye, moved out to meet him, snarling, his teeth bared.
02222	Behind him, a younger male showed his fangs as well.
02223	The direwolf’s pale yellow eyes drank in the sights around them.
02224	A nest of entrails coiled through a bush, entangled with the branches.
02225	Steam rising from an open belly, rich with the smells of blood and meat.
02226	A head staring sightlessly up at a horned moon, cheeks ripped and torn down to bloody bone, pits for eyes, neck ending in a ragged stump.
02227	A pool of frozen blood, glistening red and black.
02228	Men.
02229	The stink of them filled the world.
02230	Alive, they had been as many as the fingers on a man’s paw, but now they were none.
02231	Dead.
02232	Done.
02233	Meat.
02234	Cloaked and hooded, once, but the wolves had torn their clothing into pieces in their frenzy to get at the flesh.
02235	Those who still had faces wore thick beards crusted with ice and frozen snot.
02236	The falling snow had begun to bury what remained of them, so pale against the black of ragged cloaks and breeches.
02237	Black.
02238	Long leagues away, the boy stirred uneasily.
02239	Black.
02240	Night’s Watch.
02241	They were Night’s Watch.
02242	The direwolf did not care.
02243	They were meat.
02244	He was hungry.
02245	The eyes of the three wolves glowed yellow.
02246	The direwolf swung his head from side to side, nostrils flaring, then bared his fangs in a snarl.
02247	The younger male backed away.
02248	The direwolf could smell the fear in him.
02249	Tail, he knew.
02250	But the one:eyed wolf answered with a growl and moved to block his advance.
02251	Head.
02252	And he does not fear me though I am twice his size.
02253	Their eyes met.
02254	Warg! Then the two rushed together, wolf and direwolf, and there was no more time for thought.
02255	The world shrank down to tooth and claw, snow flying as they rolled and spun and tore at one another, the other wolves snarling and snapping around them.
02256	His jaws closed on matted fur slick with hoarfrost, on a limb thin as a dry stick, but the one:eyed wolf clawed at his belly and tore himself free, rolled, lunged for him.
02257	Yellow fangs snapped closed on his throat, but he shook off his old grey cousin as he would a rat, then charged after him, knocked him down.
02258	Rolling, ripping, kicking, they fought until the both of them were ragged and fresh blood dappled the snows around them.
02259	But finally the old one:eyed wolf lay down and showed his belly.
02260	The direwolf snapped at him twice more, sniffed at his butt, then lifted a leg over him.
02261	A few snaps and a warning growl, and the female and the tail submitted too.
02262	The pack was his.
02263	The prey as well.
02264	He went from man to man, sniffing, before settling on the biggest, a faceless thing who clutched black iron in one hand.
02265	His other hand was missing, severed at the wrist, the stump bound up in leather.
02266	Blood flowed thick and sluggish from the slash across his throat.
02267	The wolf lapped at it with his tongue, licked the ragged eyeless ruin of his nose and cheeks, then buried his muzzle in his neck and tore it open, gulping down a gobbet of sweet meat.
02268	No flesh had ever tasted half as good.
02269	When he was done with that one, he moved to the next, and devoured the choicest bits of that man too.
02270	Ravens watched him from the trees, squatting dark:eyed and silent on the branches as snow drifted down around them.
02271	The other wolves made do with his leavings:: the old male fed first, then the female, then the tail.
02272	They were his now.
02273	They were pack.
02274	No, the boy whispered, we have another pack.
02275	Lady’s dead and maybe Grey Wind too, but somewhere there’s still Shaggydog and Nymeria and Ghost.
02276	Remember Ghost? Falling snow and feasting wolves began to dim.
02277	Warmth beat against his face, comforting as a mother’s kisses.
02278	Fire, he thought, smoke.
02279	His nose twitched to the smell of roasting meat.
02280	And then the forest fell away, and he was back in the longhall again, back in his broken body, staring at a fire.
02281	Meera Reed was turning a chunk of raw red flesh above the flames, letting it char and spit.
02282	“Just in time,” she said.
02283	Bran rubbed his eyes with the heel of his hand and wriggled backwards against the wall to sit.
02284	“You almost slept through supper.
02285	The ranger found a sow.
02286	” Behind her, Hodor was tearing eagerly at a chunk of hot charred flesh as blood and grease ran down into his beard.
02287	Wisps of smoke rose from between his fingers.
02288	“Hodor,” he muttered between bites, “hodor, hodor.
02289	” His sword lay on the earthen floor beside him.
02290	Jojen Reed nipped at his own joint with small bites, chewing each chunk of meat a dozen times before swallowing.
02291	The ranger killed a pig.
02292	Coldhands stood beside the door, a raven on his arm, both staring at the fire.
02293	Reflections from the flames glittered off four black eyes.
02294	He does not eat, Bran remembered, and he fears the flames.
02295	“You said no fire,” he reminded the ranger.
02296	“The walls around us hide the light, and dawn is close.
02297	We will be on our way soon.
02298	” “What happened to the men? The foes behind us?” “They will not trouble you.
02299	” “Who were they? Wildlings?” Meera turned the meat to cook the other side.
02300	Hodor was chewing and swallowing, muttering happily under his breath.
02301	Only Jojen seemed aware of what was happening as Coldhands turned his head to stare at Bran.
02302	“They were foes.
02303	” Men of the Night’s Watch.
02304	“You killed them.
02305	You and the ravens.
02306	Their faces were all torn, and their eyes were gone.
02307	” Coldhands did not deny it.
02308	“They were your brothers.
02309	I saw.
02310	The wolves had ripped their clothes up, but I could still tell.
02311	Their cloaks were black.
02312	Like your hands.
02313	” Cold:hands said nothing.
02314	“Who are you? Why are your hands black?” The ranger studied his hands as if he had never noticed them before.
02315	“Once the heart has ceased to beat, a man’s blood runs down into his extremities, where it thickens and congeals.
02316	” His voice rattled in his throat, as thin and gaunt as he was.
02317	“His hands and feet swell up and turn as black as pudding.
02318	The rest of him becomes as white as milk.
02319	” Meera Reed rose, her frog spear in her hand, a chunk of smoking meat still impaled upon its tines.
02320	“Show us your face.
02321	” The ranger made no move to obey.
02322	“He’s dead.
02323	” Bran could taste the bile in his throat.
02324	“Meera, he’s some dead thing.
02325	The monsters cannot pass so long as the Wall stands and the men of the Night’s Watch stay true, that’s what Old Nan used to say.
02326	He came to meet us at the Wall, but he could not pass.
02327	He sent Sam instead, with that wildling girl.
02328	” Meera’s gloved hand tightened around the shaft of her frog spear.
02329	“Who sent you? Who is this three:eyed crow?” “A friend.
02330	Dreamer, wizard, call him what you will.
02331	The last green:seer.
02332	” The longhall’s wooden door banged open.
02333	Outside, the night wind howled, bleak and black.
02334	The trees were full of ravens, screaming.
02335	Cold:hands did not move.
02336	“A monster,” Bran said.
02337	The ranger looked at Bran as if the rest of them did not exist.
02338	“Your monster, Brandon Stark.
02339	” “Yours,” the raven echoed, from his shoulder.
02340	Outside the door, the ravens in the trees took up the cry, until the night wood echoed to the murderer’s song of “Yours, yours, yours.
02341	” “Jojen, did you dream this?” Meera asked her brother.
02342	“Who is he? What is he? What do we do now?” “We go with the ranger,” said Jojen.
02343	“We have come too far to turn back now, Meera.
02344	We would never make it back to the Wall alive.
02345	We go with Bran’s monster, or we die.
02346	” TYRION They departed Pentos by the Sunrise Gate, though Tyrion Lannister never glimpsed the sunrise.
02347	“It will be as if you had never come to Pentos, my little friend,” promised Magister Illyrio, as he drew shut the litter’s purple velvet drapes.
02348	“No man must see you leave the city, as no man saw you enter.
02349	” “No man except the sailors who stuffed me in that barrel, the cabin boy who cleaned up after me, the girl you sent to warm my bed, and that treacherous freckled washerwoman.
02350	Oh, and your guards.
02351	Unless you removed their wits along with their balls, they know you’re not alone in here.
02352	” The litter was suspended between eight mammoth draft horses on heavy leather straps.
02353	Four eunuchs paced beside the horses, two to either side, and more were trudging along behind to guard the baggage train.
02354	“Unsullied tell no tales,” Illyrio assured him.
02355	“And the galley that delivered you is on her way to Asshai even now.
02356	It will be two years before she returns, if the seas are kind.
02357	As for my household, they love me well.
02358	None would betray me.
02359	” Cherish that thought, my fat friend.
02360	One day we will carve those words upon your crypt.
02361	“We should be aboard that galley,” the dwarf said.
02362	“The fastest way to Volantis is by sea.
02363	” “The sea is hazardous,” replied Illyrio.
02364	“Autumn is a season rife with storms, and pirates still make their dens upon the Stepstones and venture forth to prey on honest men.
02365	It would never do for my little friend to fall into such hands.
02366	” “There are pirates on the Rhoyne as well.
02367	” “River pirates.
02368	” The cheesemonger gave a yawn, covering his mouth with the back of his hand.
02369	“Cockroach captains scurrying after crumbs.
02370	” “One hears talk of stone men as well.
02371	” “They are real enough, poor damned things.
02372	But why speak of such things? The day is too fine for such talk.
02373	We shall see the Rhoyne soon, and there you shall be rid of Illyrio and his big belly.
02374	Till then, let us drink and dream.
02375	We have sweet wine and savories to enjoy.
02376	Why dwell upon disease and death?” Why indeed? Tyrion heard the thrum of a crossbow once again, and wondered.
02377	The litter swayed side to side, a soothing movement that made him feel as if he were a child being rocked to sleep in his mother’s arms.
02378	Not that I would know what that was like.
02379	Silk pillows stuffed with goose down cushioned his cheeks.
02380	The purple velvet walls curved overhead to form a roof, making it pleasantly warm within despite the autumn chill outside.
02381	A train of mules trailed behind them, carrying chests and casks and barrels, and hampers of delectables to keep the lord of cheese from growing peckish.
02382	They nibbled on spiced sausage that morning, washed down with a dark smokeberry brown.
02383	Jellied eels and Dornish reds filled their afternoon.
02384	Come evening there were sliced hams, boiled eggs, and roasted larks stuffed with garlic and onions, with pale ales and Myrish fire wines to help in their digestion.
02385	The litter was as slow as it was comfortable, however, and the dwarf soon found himself itching with impatience.
02386	“How many days until we reach the river?” he asked Illyrio that evening.
02387	“At this pace, your queen’s dragons will be larger than Aegon’s three before I can lay eyes upon them.
02388	” “Would it were so.
02389	A large dragon is more fearsome than a small one.
02390	” The magister shrugged.
02391	“Much as it would please me to welcome Queen Daenerys to Volantis, I must rely on you and Griff for that.
02392	I can serve her best in Pentos, smoothing the way for her return.
02393	So long as I am with you, though … well, an old fat man must have his comforts, yes? Come, drink a cup of wine.
02394	” “Tell me,” Tyrion said as he drank, “why should a magister of Pentos give three figs who wears the crown in Westeros? Where is the gain for you in this venture, my lord?” The fat man dabbed grease from his lips.
02395	“I am an old man, grown weary of this world and its treacheries.
02396	Is it so strange that I should wish to do some good before my days are done, to help a sweet young girl regain her birthright?” Next you will be offering me a suit of magic armor and a palace in Valyria.
02397	“If Daenerys is no more than a sweet young girl, the Iron Throne will cut her into sweet young pieces.
02398	” “Fear not, my little friend.
02399	The blood of Aegon the Dragon flows in her veins.
02400	” Along with the blood of Aegon the Unworthy, Maegor the Cruel, and Baelor the Befuddled.
02401	“Tell me more of her.
02402	” The fat man grew pensive.
02403	“Daenerys was half a child when she came to me, yet fairer even than my second wife, so lovely I was tempted to claim her for myself.
02404	Such a fearful, furtive thing, however, I knew I should get no joy from coupling with her.
02405	Instead I summoned a bed:warmer and fucked her vigorously until the madness passed.
02406	If truth be told, I did not think Daenerys would survive for long amongst the horselords.
02407	” “That did not stop you selling her to Khal Drogo …” “Dothraki neither buy nor sell.
02408	Say rather that her brother Viserys gave her to Drogo to win the khal’s friendship.
02409	A vain young man, and greedy.
02410	Viserys lusted for his father’s throne, but he lusted for Daenerys too, and was loath to give her up.
02411	The night before the princess wed he tried to steal into her bed, insisting that if he could not have her hand, he would claim her maidenhead.
02412	Had I not taken the precaution of posting guards upon her door, Viserys might have undone years of planning.
02413	” “He sounds an utter fool.
02414	” “Viserys was Mad Aerys’s son, just so.
02415	Daenerys … Daenerys is quite different.
02416	” He popped a roasted lark into his mouth and crunched it noisily, bones and all.
02417	“The frightened child who sheltered in my manse died on the Dothraki sea, and was reborn in blood and fire.
02418	This dragon queen who wears her name is a true Targaryen.
02419	When I sent ships to bring her home, she turned toward Slaver’s Bay.
02420	In a short span of days she conquered Astapor, made Yunkai bend the knee, and sacked Meereen.
02421	Mantarys will be next, if she marches west along the old Valyrian roads.
02422	If she comes by sea, well … her fleet must take on food and water at Volantis.
02423	” “By land or by sea, there are long leagues between Meereen and Volantis,” Tyrion observed.
02424	“Five hundred fifty, as the dragon flies, through deserts, mountains, swamps, and demon:haunted ruins.
02425	Many and more will perish, but those who survive will be stronger by the time they reach Volantis … where they shall find you and Griff awaiting them, with fresh forces and sufficient ships to carry them all across the sea to Westeros.
02426	” Tyrion pondered all he knew of Volantis, oldest and proudest of the Nine Free Cities.
02427	Something was awry here.
02428	Even with half a nose, he could smell it.
02429	“It’s said there are five slaves for every free man in Volantis.
02430	Why would the triarchs assist a queen who smashed the slave trade?” He pointed at Illyrio.
02431	“For that matter, why would you? Slavery may be forbidden by the laws of Pentos, yet you have a finger in that trade as well, and maybe a whole hand.
02432	And yet you conspire for the dragon queen, and not against her.
02433	Why? What do you hope to gain from Queen Daenerys?” “Are we back to that again? You are a persistent little man.
02434	” Illyrio gave a laugh and slapped his belly.
02435	“As you will.
02436	The Beggar King swore that I should be his master of coin, and a lordly lord as well.
02437	Once he wore his golden crown, I should have my choice of castles … even Casterly Rock, if I desired.
02438	” Tyrion snorted wine back up the scarred stump that had been his nose.
02439	“My father would have loved to hear that.
02440	” “Your lord father had no cause for concern.
02441	Why would I want a rock? My manse is large enough for any man, and more comfortable than your drafty Westerosi castles.
02442	Master of coin, though …” The fat man peeled another egg.
02443	“I am fond of coins.
02444	Is there any sound as sweet as the clink of gold on gold?” A sister’s screams.
02445	“Are you quite certain that Daenerys will make good her brother’s promises?” “She will, or she will not.
02446	” Illyrio bit the egg in half.
02447	“I told you, my little friend, not all that a man does is done for gain.
02448	Believe as you wish, but even fat old fools like me have friends, and debts of affection to repay.
02449	” Liar, thought Tyrion.
02450	There is something in this venture worth more to you than coin or castles.
02451	“You meet so few men who value friendship over gold these days.
02452	” “Too true,” the fat man said, deaf to the irony.
02453	“How is it that the Spider became so dear to you?” “We were young together, two green boys in Pentos.
02454	” “Varys came from Myr.
02455	” “So he did.
02456	I met him not long after he arrived, one step ahead of the slavers.
02457	By day he slept in the sewers, by night he prowled the rooftops like a cat.
02458	I was near as poor, a bravo in soiled silks, living by my blade.
02459	Perhaps you chanced to glimpse the statue by my pool? Pytho Malanon carved that when I was six:and:ten.
02460	A lovely thing, though now I weep to see it.
02461	” “Age makes ruins of us all.
02462	I am still in mourning for my nose.
02463	But Varys …” “In Myr he was a prince of thieves, until a rival thief informed on him.
02464	In Pentos his accent marked him, and once he was known for a eunuch he was despised and beaten.
02465	Why he chose me to protect him I may never know, but we came to an arrangement.
02466	Varys spied on lesser thieves and took their takings.
02467	I offered my help to their victims, promising to recover their valuables for a fee.
02468	Soon every man who had suffered a loss knew to come to me, whilst city’s footpads and cutpurses sought out Varys … half to slit his throat, the other half to sell him what they’d stolen.
02469	We both grew rich, and richer still when Varys trained his mice.
02470	” “In King’s Landing he kept little birds.
02471	” “Mice, we called them then.
02472	The older thieves were fools who thought no further than turning a night’s plunder into wine.
02473	Varys preferred orphan boys and young girls.
02474	He chose the smallest, the ones who were quick and quiet, and taught them to climb walls and slip down chimneys.
02475	He taught them to read as well.
02476	We left the gold and gems for common thieves.
02477	Instead our mice stole letters, ledgers, charts … later, they would read them and leave them where they lay.
02478	Secrets are worth more than silver or sapphires, Varys claimed.
02479	Just so.
02480	I grew so respectable that a cousin of the Prince of Pentos let me wed his maiden daughter, whilst whispers of a certain eunuch’s talents crossed the narrow sea and reached the ears of a certain king.
02481	A very anxious king, who did not wholly trust his son, nor his wife, nor his Hand, a friend of his youth who had grown arrogant and overproud.
02482	I do believe that you know the rest of this tale, is that not so?” “Much of it,” Tyrion admitted.
02483	“I see that you are somewhat more than a cheesemonger after all.
02484	” Illyrio inclined his head.
02485	“You are kind to say so, my little friend.
02486	And for my part, I see that you are just as quick as Lord Varys claimed.
02487	” He smiled, showing all his crooked yellow teeth, and shouted for another jar of Myrish fire wine.
02488	When the magister drifted off to sleep with the wine jar at his elbow, Tyrion crept across the pillows to work it loose from its fleshy prison and pour himself a cup.
02489	He drained it down, and yawned, and filled it once again.
02490	If I drink enough fire wine, he told himself, perhaps I’ll dream of dragons.
02491	When he was still a lonely child in the depths of Casterly Rock, he oft rode dragons through the nights, pretending he was some lost Targaryen princeling, or a Valyrian dragonlord soaring high o’er fields and mountains.
02492	Once, when his uncles asked him what gift he wanted for his name:day, he begged them for a dragon.
02493	“It wouldn’t need to be a big one.
02494	It could be little, like I am.
02495	” His uncle Gerion thought that was the funniest thing he had ever heard, but his uncle Tygett said, “The last dragon died a century ago, lad.
02496	” That had seemed so monstrously unfair that the boy had cried himself to sleep that night.
02497	Yet if the lord of cheese could be believed, the Mad King’s daughter had hatched three living dragons.
02498	Two more than even a Targaryen should require.
02499	Tyrion was almost sorry that he had killed his father.
02500	He would have enjoyed seeing Lord Tywin’s face when he learned that there was a Targaryen queen on her way to Westeros with three dragons, backed by a scheming eunuch and a cheesemonger half the size of Casterly Rock.
02501	The dwarf was so stuffed that he had to undo his belt and the topmost laces on his breeches.
02502	The boy’s clothes his host had dressed him in made him feel like ten pounds of sausage in a five:pound skin.
02503	If we eat this way every day I will be the size of Illyrio before I meet this dragon queen.
02504	Out:side the litter night had fallen.
02505	Inside all was dark.
02506	Tyrion listened to Illyrio’s snores, the creak of the leather straps, the slow clop clop of the team’s ironshod hooves on the hard Valyrian road, but his heart was listening for the beat of leathern wings.
02507	When he woke, dawn had come.
02508	The horses plodded on, the litter creaking and swaying between them.
02509	Tyrion pulled the curtain back an inch to peer outside, but there was little to see but ochre fields, bare brown elms, and the road itself, a broad stone highway that ran straight as a spear to the horizon.
02510	He had read about Valyrian roads, but this was the first he had seen.
02511	The Freehold’s grasp had reached as far as Dragonstone, but never to the mainland of Westeros itself.
02512	Odd, that.
02513	Dragonstone is no more than a rock.
02514	The wealth was farther west, but they had dragons.
02515	Surely they knew that it was there.
02516	He had drunk too much last night.
02517	His head was pounding, and even the gentle swaying of the litter was enough to make his gorge rise in his throat.
02518	Though he said no word of complaint, his distress must have been plain to Illyrio Mopatis.
02519	“Come, drink with me,” the fat man said.
02520	“A scale from the dragon that burned you, as they say.
02521	” He poured for them from a flagon of blackberry wine so sweet that it drew more flies than honey.
02522	Tyrion shooed them off with the back of his hand and drank deep.
02523	The taste was so cloying that it was all he could do to keep it down.
02524	The second cup went down easier, however.
02525	Even so, he had no appetite, and when Illyrio offered him a bowl of blackberries in cream he waved it off.
02526	“I dreamed about the queen,” he said.
02527	“I was on my knees before her, swearing my allegiance, but she mistook me for my brother, Jaime, and fed me to her dragons.
02528	” “Let us hope this dream was not prophetic.
02529	You are a clever imp, just as Varys said, and Daenerys will have need of clever men about her.
02530	Ser Barristan is a valiant knight and true:: but none, I think, has ever called him cunning.
02531	” “Knights know only one way to solve a problem.
02532	They couch their lances and charge.
02533	A dwarf has a different way of looking at the world.
02534	What of you, though? You are a clever man yourself.
02535	” “You flatter me.
02536	” Illyrio waggled his hand.
02537	“Alas, I am not made for travel, so I will send you to Daenerys in my stead.
02538	You did Her Grace a great service when you slew your father, and it is my hope that you will do her many more.
02539	Daenerys is not the fool her brother was.
02540	She will make good use of you.
02541	” As kindling? Tyrion thought, smiling pleasantly.
02542	They changed out teams only thrice that day but seemed to halt twice an hour at the least so Illyrio could climb down from the litter and have himself a piss.
02543	Our lord of cheese is the size of an elephant, but he has a bladder like a peanut, the dwarf mused.
02544	During one stop, he used the time to have a closer look at the road.
02545	Tyrion knew what he would find: not packed earth, nor bricks, nor cobbles, but a ribbon of fused stone raised a half foot above the ground to allow rainfall and snowmelt to run off its shoulders.
02546	Unlike the muddy tracks that passed for roads in the Seven Kingdoms, the Valyrian roads were wide enough for three wagons to pass abreast, and neither time nor traffic marred them.
02547	They still endured, unchanging, four centuries after Valyria itself had met its Doom.
02548	He looked for ruts and cracks but found only a pile of warm dung deposited by one of the horses.
02549	The dung made him think of his lord father.
02550	Are you down in some hell, Father? A nice cold hell where you can look up and see me help restore Mad Aerys’s daughter to the Iron Throne? As they resumed their journey, Illyrio produced a bag of roasted chestnuts and began to speak once more of the dragon queen.
02551	“Our last news of Queen Daenerys is old and stale, I fear.
02552	By now she will have left Meereen, we must assume.
02553	She has her host at last, a ragged host of sellswords, Dothraki horselords, and Unsullied infantry, and she will no doubt lead them west, to take back her father’s throne.
02554	” Magister Illyrio twisted open a pot of garlic snails, sniffed at them, and smiled.
02555	“At Volantis, you will have fresh tidings of Daenerys, we must hope,” he said, as he sucked one from its shell.
02556	“Dragons and young girls are both capricious, and it may be that you will need to adjust your plans.
02557	Griff will know what to do.
02558	Will you have a snail? The garlic is from my own gardens.
02559	” I could ride a snail and make a better pace than this litter of yours.
02560	Tyrion waved the dish away.
02561	“You place a deal of trust in this man Griff.
02562	Another friend of your childhood?” “No.
02563	A sellsword, you would call him, but Westerosi born.
02564	Daenerys needs men worthy of her cause.
02565	” Illyrio raised a hand.
02566	“I know! ‘Sellswords put gold before honor,’ you are thinking.
02567	‘This man Griff will sell me to my sister.
02568	’ Not so.
02569	I trust Griff as I would trust a brother.
02570	” Another mortal error.
02571	“Then I shall do likewise.
02572	” “The Golden Company marches toward Volantis as we speak, there to await the coming of our queen out of the east.
02573	” Beneath the gold, the bitter steel.
02574	“I had heard the Golden Company was under contract with one of the Free Cities.
02575	” “Myr.
02576	” Illyrio smirked.
02577	“Contracts can be broken.
02578	” “There is more coin in cheese than I knew,” said Tyrion.
02579	“How did you accomplish that?” The magister waggled his fat fingers.
02580	“Some contracts are writ in ink, and some in blood.
02581	I say no more.
02582	” The dwarf pondered that.
02583	The Golden Company was reputedly the finest of the free companies, founded a century ago by Bittersteel, a bastard son of Aegon the Unworthy.
02584	When another of Aegon’s Great Bastards tried to seize the Iron Throne from his trueborn half:brother, Bittersteel joined the revolt.
02585	Daemon Blackfyre had perished on the Redgrass Field, however, and his rebellion with him.
02586	Those followers of the Black Dragon who survived the battle yet refused to bend the knee fled across the narrow sea, among them Daemon’s younger sons, Bittersteel, and hundreds of landless lords and knights who soon found themselves forced to sell their swords to eat.
02587	Some joined the Ragged Standard, some the Second Sons or Maiden’s Men.
02588	Bittersteel saw the strength of House Blackfyre scattering to the four winds, so he formed the Golden Company to bind the exiles together.
02589	From that day to this, the men of the Golden Company had lived and died in the Disputed Lands, fighting for Myr or Lys or Tyrosh in their pointless little wars, and dreaming of the land their fathers had lost.
02590	They were exiles and sons of exiles, dispossessed and unforgiven … yet formidable fighters still.
02591	“I admire your powers of persuasion,” Tyrion told Illyrio.
02592	“How did you convince the Golden Company to take up the cause of our sweet queen when they have spent so much of their history fighting against the Targaryens?” Illyrio brushed away the objection as if it were a fly.
02593	“Black or red, a dragon is still a dragon.
02594	When Maelys the Monstrous died upon the Stepstones, it was the end of the male line of House Blackfyre.
02595	” The cheesemonger smiled through his forked beard.
02596	“And Daenerys will give the exiles what Bittersteel and the Blackfyres never could.
02597	She will take them home.
02598	” With fire and sword.
02599	It was the kind of homecoming that Tyrion wished for as well.
02600	“Ten thousand swords makes for a princely gift, I grant you.
02601	Her Grace should be most pleased.
02602	” The magister gave a modest bob of his head, chins jiggling.
02603	“I would never presume to say what might please Her Grace.
02604	” Prudent of you.
02605	Tyrion knew much and more about the gratitude of kings.
02606	Why should queens be any different? Soon enough the magister was fast asleep, leaving Tyrion to brood alone.
02607	He wondered what Barristan Selmy would think of riding into battle with the Golden Company.
02608	During the War of the Ninepenny Kings, Selmy had cut a bloody path through their ranks to slay the last of the Blackfyre Pretenders.
02609	Rebellion makes for queer bedfellows.
02610	And none more queer than this fat man and me.
02611	The cheesemonger woke when they stopped to change the horses and sent for a fresh hamper.
02612	“How far have we come?” the dwarf asked him as they stuffed themselves with cold capon and a relish made of carrots, raisins, and bits of lime and orange.
02613	“This is Andalos, my friend.
02614	The land your Andals came from.
02615	They took it from the hairy men who were here before them, cousins to the hairy men of Ib.
02616	The heart of Hugor’s ancient realm lies north of us, but we are passing through its southern marches.
02617	In Pentos, these are called the Flatlands.
02618	Farther east stand the Velvet Hills, whence we are bound.
02619	” Andalos.
02620	The Faith taught that the Seven themselves had once walked the hills of Andalos in human form.
02621	“The Father reached his hand into the heavens and pulled down seven stars,” Tyrion recited from memory, “and one by one he set them on the brow of Hugor of the Hill to make a glowing crown.
02622	” Magister Illyrio gave him a curious look.
02623	“I did not dream my little friend was so devout.
02624	” The dwarf shrugged.
02625	“A relic of my boyhood.
02626	I knew I would not make a knight, so I decided to be High Septon.
02627	That crystal crown adds a foot to a man’s height.
02628	I studied the holy books and prayed until I had scabs on both my knees, but my quest came to a tragic end.
02629	I reached that certain age and fell in love.
02630	” “A maiden? I know the way of that.
02631	” Illyrio thrust his right hand up his left sleeve and drew out a silver locket.
02632	Inside was a painted likeness of a woman with big blue eyes and pale golden hair streaked by silver.
02633	“Serra.
02634	I found her in a Lysene pillow house and brought her home to warm my bed, but in the end I wed her.
02635	Me, whose first wife had been a cousin of the Prince of Pentos.
02636	The palace gates were closed to me thereafter, but I did not care.
02637	The price was small enough, for Serra.
02638	” “How did she die?” Tyrion knew that she was dead:: no man spoke so fondly of a woman who had abandoned him.
02639	“A Braavosi trading galley called at Pentos on her way back from the Jade Sea.
02640	The Treasure carried cloves and saffron, jet and jade, scarlet samite, green silk … and the grey death.
02641	We slew her oarsmen as they came ashore and burned the ship at anchor, but the rats crept down the oars and paddled to the quay on cold stone feet.
02642	The plague took two thousand before it ran its course.
02643	” Magister Illyrio closed the locket.
02644	“I keep her hands in my bedchamber.
02645	Her hands that were so soft …” Tyrion thought of Tysha.
02646	He glanced out at the fields where once the gods had walked.
02647	“What sort of gods make rats and plagues and dwarfs?” Another passage from The Seven:Pointed Star came back to him.
02648	“The Maid brought him forth a girl as supple as a willow with eyes like deep blue pools, and Hugor declared that he would have her for his bride.
02649	So the Mother made her fertile, and the Crone foretold that she would bear the king four:and:forty mighty sons.
02650	The Warrior gave strength to their arms, whilst the Smith wrought for each a suit of iron plates.
02651	” “Your Smith must have been Rhoynish,” Illyrio quipped.
02652	“The Andals learned the art of working iron from the Rhoynar who dwelt along the river.
02653	This is known.
02654	” “Not by our septons.
02655	” Tyrion gestured at the fields.
02656	“Who dwells in these Flatlands of yours?” “Tillers and toilers, bound to the land.
02657	There are orchards, farms, mines … I own some such myself, though I seldom visit them.
02658	Why should I spend my days out here, with the myriad delights of Pentos close at hand?” “Myriad delights.
02659	” And huge thick walls.
02660	Tyrion swirled his wine in his cup.
02661	“We have seen no towns since Pentos.
02662	” “There are ruins.
02663	” Illyrio waved a chicken leg toward the curtains.
02664	“The horselords come this way, whenever some khal takes it into his head to gaze upon the sea.
02665	The Dothraki are not fond of towns, you will know this even in Westeros.
02666	” “Fall upon one of these khalasars and destroy it, and you may find that the Dothraki are not so quick to cross the Rhoyne.
02667	” “It is cheaper to buy off foes with food and gifts.
02668	” If only I had thought to bring a nice cheese to the battle on the Blackwater, I might still have all my nose.
02669	Lord Tywin had always held the Free Cities in contempt.
02670	They fight with coins instead of swords, he used to say.
02671	Gold has its uses, but wars are won with iron.
02672	“Give gold to a foe and he will just come back for more, my father always said.
02673	” “Is this the selfsame father that you murdered?” Illyrio tossed his chicken bone from the litter.
02674	“Sellswords will not stand against Dothraki screamers.
02675	That was proved at Qohor.
02676	” “Not even your brave Griff?” mocked Tyrion.
02677	“Griff is different.
02678	He has a son he dotes on.
02679	Young Griff, the boy is called.
02680	There never was a nobler lad.
02681	” The wine, the food, the sun, the sway of the litter, the buzzing of the flies, all conspired to make Tyrion sleepy.
02682	So he slept, woke, drank.
02683	Illyrio matched him cup for cup.
02684	And as the sky turned a dusky purple, the fat man began to snore.
02685	That night Tyrion Lannister dreamed of a battle that turned the hills of Westeros as red as blood.
02686	He was in the midst of it, dealing death with an axe as big as he was, fighting side by side with Barristan the Bold and Bittersteel as dragons wheeled across the sky above them.
02687	In the dream he had two heads, both noseless.
02688	His father led the enemy, so he slew him once again.
02689	Then he killed his brother, Jaime, hacking at his face until it was a red ruin, laughing every time he struck a blow.
02690	Only when the fight was finished did he realize that his second head was weeping.
02691	When he woke his stunted legs were stiff as iron.
02692	Illyrio was eating olives.
02693	“Where are we?” Tyrion asked him.
02694	“We have not yet left the Flatlands, my hasty friend.
02695	Soon our road shall pass into the Velvet Hills.
02696	There we begin our climb toward Ghoyan Drohe, upon the Little Rhoyne.
02697	” Ghoyan Drohe had been a Rhoynar city, until the dragons of Valyria had reduced it to a smoldering desolation.
02698	I am traveling through years as well as leagues, Tyrion reflected, back through history to the days when dragons ruled the earth.
02699	Tyrion slept and woke and slept again, and day and night seemed not to matter.
02700	The Velvet Hills proved a disappointment.
02701	“Half the whores in Lannisport have breasts bigger than these hills,” he told Illyrio.
02702	“You ought to call them the Velvet Teats.
02703	” They saw a circle of standing stones that Illyrio claimed had been raised by giants, and later a deep lake.
02704	“Here lived a den of robbers who preyed on all who passed this way,” Illyrio said.
02705	“It is said they still dwell beneath the water.
02706	Those who fish the lake are pulled under and devoured.
02707	” The next evening they came upon a huge Valyrian sphinx crouched beside the road.
02708	It had a dragon’s body and a woman’s face.
02709	“A dragon queen,” said Tyrion.
02710	“A pleasant omen.
02711	” “Her king is missing.
02712	” Illyrio pointed out the smooth stone plinth on which the second sphinx once stood, now grown over with moss and flowering vines.
02713	“The horselords built wooden wheels beneath him and dragged him back to Vaes Dothrak.
02714	” That is an omen too, thought Tyrion, but not as hopeful.
02715	That night, drunker than usual, he broke into sudden song.
02716	He rode through the streets of the city, down from his hill on high, O’er the wynds and the steps and the cobbles, he rode to a woman’s sigh.
02717	For she was his secret treasure, she was his shame and his bliss.
02718	And a chain and a keep are nothing, compared to a woman’s kiss.
02719	Those were all the words he knew, aside from the refrain.
02720	Hands of gold are always cold, but a woman’s hands are warm.
02721	Shae’s hands had beat at him as the golden hands dug into her throat.
02722	He did not remember if they’d been warm or not.
02723	As the strength went out of her, her blows became moths fluttering about his face.
02724	Each time he gave the chain another twist the golden hands dug deeper.
02725	A chain and a keep are nothing, compared to a woman’s kiss.
02726	Had he kissed her one last time, after she was dead? He could not remember … though he still recalled the first time they had kissed, in his tent beside the Green Fork.
02727	How sweet her mouth had tasted.
02728	He remembered the first time with Tysha as well.
02729	She did not know how, no more than I did.
02730	We kept bumping our noses, but when I touched her tongue with mine she trembled.
02731	Tyrion closed his eyes to bring her face to mind, but instead he saw his father, squatting on a privy with his bed:robe hiked up about his waist.
02732	“Wherever whores go,” Lord Tywin said, and the crossbow thrummed.
02733	The dwarf rolled over, pressing half a nose deep into the silken pillows.
02734	Sleep opened beneath him like a well, and he threw himself into it with a will and let the darkness eat him up.
02735	THE MERCHANT’S MAN Adventure stank.
02736	She boasted sixty oars, a single sail, and a long lean hull that promised speed.
02737	Small, but she might serve, Quentyn thought when he saw her, but that was before he went aboard and got a good whiff of her.
02738	Pigs, was his first thought, but after a second sniff he changed his mind.
02739	Pigs had a cleaner smell.
02740	This stink was piss and rotting meat and night:soil, this was the reek of corpse flesh and weeping sores and wounds gone bad, so strong that it overwhelmed the salt air and fish smell of the harbor.
02741	“I want to retch,” he said to Gerris Drinkwater.
02742	They were waiting for the ship’s master to appear, sweltering in the heat as the stench wafted up from the deck beneath them.
02743	“If the captain smells anything like his ship, he may mistake your vomit for perfume,” Gerris replied.
02744	Quentyn was about to suggest that they try another ship when the master finally made his appearance, with two vile:looking crewmen at his side.
02745	Gerris greeted him with a smile.
02746	Though he did not speak the Volantene tongue as well as Quentyn, their ruse required that he speak for them.
02747	Back in the Planky Town Quentyn had played the wineseller, but the mummery had chafed at him, so when the Dornishmen changed ships at Lys they had changed roles as well.
02748	Aboard the Meadowlark, Cletus Yronwood became the merchant, Quentyn the servant:: in Volantis, with Cletus slain, Gerris had assumed the master’s role.
02749	Tall and fair, with blue:green eyes, sandy hair streaked by the sun, and a lean and comely body, Gerris Drinkwater had a swagger to him, a confidence bordering on arrogance.
02750	He never seemed ill at ease, and even when he did not speak the language, he had ways of making himself understood.
02751	Quentyn cut a poor figure by comparison— short:legged and stocky, thickly built, with hair the brown of new:turned earth.
02752	His forehead was too high, his jaw too square, his nose too broad.
02753	A good honest face, a girl had called it once, but you should smile more.
02754	Smiles had never come easily for Quentyn Martell, any more than they did for his lord father.
02755	“How swift is your Adventure?” Gerris said, in a halting approximation of High Valyrian.
02756	The Adventure’s master recognized the accent and responded in the Common Tongue of Westeros.
02757	“There is none swifter, honored lord.
02758	Adventure can run down the wind itself.
02759	Tell me where you wish to sail, and swiftly I shall bring you there.
02760	” “I seek passage to Meereen for myself and two servants.
02761	” That gave the captain pause.
02762	“I am no stranger to Meereen.
02763	I could find the city again, aye … but why? There are no slaves to be had in Meereen, no profit to be found there.
02764	The silver queen has put an end to that.
02765	She has even closed the fighting pits, so a poor sailor cannot even amuse himself as he waits to fill his holds.
02766	Tell me, my Westerosi friend, what is there in Meereen that you should want to go there?” The most beautiful woman in the world, thought Quentyn.
02767	My bride:to:be, if the gods are good.
02768	Sometimes at night he lay awake imagining her face and form, and wondering why such a woman would ever want to marry him, of all the princes in the world.
02769	I am Dorne, he told himself.
02770	She will want Dorne.
02771	Gerris answered with the tale they had concocted.
02772	“Wine is our family trade.
02773	My father owns extensive vineyards back in Dorne, and wishes me to find new markets.
02774	It is hoped that the good folk of Meereen will welcome what I sell.
02775	” “Wine? Dornish wine?” The captain was not convinced.
02776	“The slave cities are at war.
02777	Can it be you do not know this?” “The fighting is between Yunkai and Astapor, we had heard.
02778	Meereen is not involved.
02779	” “Not as yet.
02780	But soon.
02781	An envoy from the Yellow City is in Volantis even now, hiring swords.
02782	The Long Lances have already taken ship for Yunkai, and the Windblown and the Company of the Cat will follow once they have finished filling out their ranks.
02783	The Golden Company marches east as well.
02784	All this is known.
02785	” “If you say so.
02786	I deal in wine, not wars.
02787	Ghiscari wine is poor stuff, all agree.
02788	The Meereenese will pay a good price for my fine Dornish vintages.
02789	” “Dead men do not care what kind of wine they drink.
02790	” The master of Adventure fingered his beard.
02791	“I am not the first captain you have approached, I think.
02792	Nor the tenth.
02793	” “No,” Gerris admitted.
02794	“How many, then? A hundred?” Close enough, thought Quentyn.
02795	The Volantenes were fond of boasting that the hundred isles of Braavos could be dropped into their deep harbor and drowned.
02796	Quentyn had never seen Braavos, but he could believe it.
02797	Rich and ripe and rotted, Volantis covered the mouth of the Rhoyne like a warm wet kiss, stretching across hill and marsh on both sides of the river.
02798	Ships were everywhere, coming down the river or headed out to sea, crowding the wharves and piers, taking on cargo or off:loading it: warships and whalers and trading galleys, carracks and skiffs, cogs, great cogs, long:ships, swan ships, ships from Lys and Tyrosh and Pentos, Qartheen spicers big as palaces, ships from Tolos and Yunkai and the Basilisks.
02799	So many that Quentyn, seeing the port for the first time from the deck of the Meadowlark, had told his friends that they would only linger here three days.
02800	Yet twenty days had passed, and here they remained, still shipless.
02801	The captains of the Melantine, the Triarch’s Daughter, and the Mermaid’s Kiss had all refused them.
02802	A mate on the Bold Voyager had laughed in their faces.
02803	The master of the Dolphin berated them for wasting his time, and the owner of the Seventh Son accused them of being pirates.
02804	All on the first day.
02805	Only the captain of the Fawn had given them reasons for his refusal.
02806	“It is true that I am sailing east,” he told them, over watered wine.
02807	“South around Valyria and thence into the sunrise.
02808	We will take on water and provisions at New Ghis, then bend all oars toward Qarth and the Jade Gates.
02809	Every voyage has perils, long ones more than most.
02810	Why should I seek out more danger by turning into Slaver’s Bay? The Fawn is my livelihood.
02811	I will not risk her to take three mad Dornishmen into the middle of a war.
02812	” Quentyn had begun to think that they might have done better to buy their own ship in the Planky Town.
02813	That would have drawn unwanted attention, however.
02814	The Spider had informers everywhere, even in the halls of Sunspear.
02815	“Dorne will bleed if your purpose is discovered,” his father had warned him, as they watched the children frolic in the pools and fountains of the Water Gardens.
02816	“What we do is treason, make no mistake.
02817	Trust only your companions, and do your best to avoid attracting notice.
02818	” So Gerris Drinkwater gave the captain of Adventure his most disarming smile.
02819	“Truth be told, I have not kept count of all the cowards who refused us, but at the Merchant’s House I heard it said that you were a bolder sort of man, the sort who might risk anything for sufficient gold.
02820	” A smuggler, Quentyn thought.
02821	That was how the other traders styled Adventure’s master, back at the Merchant’s House.
02822	“He is a smuggler and a slaver, half pirate and half pander, but it may be that he is your best hope,” the innkeep had told them.
02823	The captain rubbed thumb and forefinger together.
02824	“And how much gold would you deem sufficient for such a voyage?” “Thrice your usual fee for passage to Slaver’s Bay.
02825	” “For each of you?” The captain showed his teeth in something that might have been intended as a smile though it gave his narrow face a feral look.
02826	“Perhaps.
02827	It is true, I am a bolder man than most.
02828	How soon will you wish to leave?” “The morrow would not be too soon.
02829	” “Done.
02830	Return an hour before first light, with your friends and your wines.
02831	Best to be under way whilst Volantis sleeps, so no one will ask us inconvenient questions about our destination.
02832	” “As you say.
02833	An hour before first light.
02834	” The captain’s smile widened.
02835	“I am pleased that I can help you.
02836	We will have a happy voyage, yes?” “I am certain of it,” said Gerris.
02837	The captain called for ale then, and the two of them drank a toast to their venture.
02838	“A sweet man,” Gerris said afterward, as he and Quentyn made their way down to the foot of the pier where their hired hathay waited.
02839	The air hung hot and heavy, and the sun was so bright that both of them were squinting.
02840	“This is a sweet city,” Quentyn agreed.
02841	Sweet enough to rot your teeth.
02842	Sweet beets were grown in profusion hereabouts, and were served with almost every meal.
02843	The Volantenes made a cold soup of them, as thick and rich as purple honey.
02844	Their wines were sweet as well.
02845	“I fear our happy voyage will be short, however.
02846	That sweet man does not mean to take us to Meereen.
02847	He was too quick to accept your offer.
02848	He’ll take thrice the usual fee, no doubt, and once he has us aboard and out of sight of land, he’ll slit our throats and take the rest of our gold as well.
02849	” “Or chain us to an oar, beside those wretches we were smelling.
02850	We need to find a better class of smuggler, I think.
02851	” Their driver awaited them beside his hathay.
02852	In Westeros, it might have been called an oxcart, though it was a deal more ornate than any cart that Quentyn had ever seen in Dorne, and lacked an ox.
02853	The hathay was pulled by a dwarf elephant, her hide the color of dirty snow.
02854	The streets of Old Volantis were full of such.
02855	Quentyn would have preferred to walk, but they were miles from their inn.
02856	Besides, the innkeep at the Merchant’s House had warned him that traveling afoot would taint them in the eyes of foreign captains and the native:born Volantenes alike.
02857	Persons of quality traveled by palanquin, or in the back of a hathay … and as it happened the innkeep had a cousin who owned several such contrivances and would be pleased to serve them in this matter.
02858	Their driver was one of the cousin’s slaves, a small man with a wheel tattooed upon one cheek, naked but for a breechclout and a pair of sandals.
02859	His skin was the color of teak, his eyes chips of flint.
02860	After he had helped them up onto the cushioned bench between the cart’s two huge wooden wheels, he clambered onto the elephant’s back.
02861	“The Merchant’s House,” Quentyn told him, “but go along the wharves.
02862	” Beyond the waterfront and its breezes, the streets and alleys of Volantis were hot enough to drown a man in his own sweat, at least on this side of the river.
02863	The driver shouted something at his elephant in the local tongue.
02864	The beast began to move, trunk swaying from side to side.
02865	The cart lurched along behind her, the driver hooting at sailors and slaves alike to clear the way.
02866	It was easy enough to tell one from the other.
02867	The slaves were all tattooed: a mask of blue feathers, a lightning bolt that ran from jaw to brow, a coin upon the cheek, a leopard’s spots, a skull, a jug.
02868	Maester Kedry said there were five slaves for every free man in Volantis though he had not lived long enough to verify his estimate.
02869	He had perished on the morning the corsairs swarmed aboard the Meadowlark.
02870	Quentyn lost two other friends that same day—Willam Wells with his freckles and his crooked teeth, fearless with a lance, and Cletus Yron:wood, handsome despite his lazy eye, always randy, always laughing.
02871	Cletus had been Quentyn’s dearest friend for half his life, a brother in all but blood.
02872	“Give your bride a kiss for me,” Cletus had whispered to him, just before he died.
02873	The corsairs had come aboard in the darkness before the dawn, as the Meadowlark was anchored off the coast of the Disputed Lands.
02874	The crew had beaten them off, at the cost of twelve lives.
02875	Afterward the sailors stripped the dead corsairs of boots and belts and weapons, divvied up their purses, and yanked gemstones from their ears and rings from their fingers.
02876	One of the corpses was so fat that the ship’s cook had to cut his fingers off with a meat cleaver to claim his rings.
02877	It took three Meadowlarks to roll the body into the sea.
02878	The other pirates were chucked in after him, without a word of prayer or ceremony.
02879	Their own dead received more tender treatment.
02880	The sailors sewed their bodies up in canvas, weighed down with ballast stones so they might sink more quickly.
02881	The captain of the Meadowlark led his crew in a prayer for the souls of their slain shipmates.
02882	Then he turned to his Dornish passengers, the three who still remained of the six who had come aboard at the Planky Town.
02883	Even the big man had emerged, pale and greensick and unsteady on his feet, struggling up from the depths of the ship’s hold to pay his last respects.
02884	“One of you should say some words for your dead, before we give them to the sea,” the captain said.
02885	Gerris had obliged, lying with every other word, since he dare not tell the truth of who they’d been or why they’d come.
02886	It was not supposed to end like that for them.
02887	“This will be a tale to tell our grandchildren,” Cletus had declared the day they set out from his father’s castle.
02888	Will made a face at that, and said, “A tale to tell tavern wenches, you mean, in hopes they’ll lift their skirts.
02889	” Cletus had slapped him on the back.
02890	“For grandchildren, you need children.
02891	For children, you need to lift some skirts.
02892	” Later, in the Planky Town, the Dornishmen had toasted Quentyn’s future bride, made ribald japes about his wedding night to come, and talked about the things they’d see, the deeds they’d do, the glory they would win.
02893	All they won was a sailcloth sack filled with ballast stones.
02894	As much as he mourned Will and Cletus, it was the maester’s loss that Quentyn felt most keenly.
02895	Kedry had been fluent in the tongues of all of the Free Cities, and even the mongrel Ghiscari that men spoke along the shores of Slaver’s Bay.
02896	“Maester Kedry will accompany you,” his father said the night they parted.
02897	“Heed his counsel.
02898	He has devoted half his life to the study of the Nine Free Cities.
02899	” Quentyn wondered if things might not have gone a deal easier if only he were here to guide them.
02900	“I would sell my mother for a bit of breeze,” said Gerris, as they rolled through the dockside throngs.
02901	“It’s moist as the Maiden’s cunt, and still shy of noon.
02902	I hate this city.
02903	” Quentyn shared the feeling.
02904	The sullen wet heat of Volantis sapped his strength and left him feeling dirty.
02905	The worst part was knowing that nightfall would bring no relief.
02906	Up in the high meadows north of Lord Yronwood’s estates, the air was always crisp and cool after dark, no matter how hot the day had been.
02907	Not here.
02908	In Volantis, the nights were almost as hot as the days.
02909	“The Goddess sails for New Ghis on the morrow,” Gerris reminded him.
02910	“That at least would bring us closer.
02911	” “New Ghis is an island, and a much smaller port than this.
02912	We would be closer, yes, but we could find ourselves stranded.
02913	And New Ghis has allied with the Yunkai’i.
02914	” That news had not come as a surprise to Quentyn.
02915	New Ghis and Yunkai were both Ghiscari cities.
02916	“If Volantis should ally with them as well—” “We need to find a ship from Westeros,” suggested Gerris, “some trader out of Lannisport or Oldtown.
02917	” “Few come this far, and those who do fill their holds with silk and spice from the Jade Sea, then bend their oars for home.
02918	” “Perhaps a Braavosi ship? One hears of purple sails as far away as Asshai and the islands of the Jade Sea.
02919	” “The Braavosi are descended from escaped slaves.
02920	They do not trade in Slaver’s Bay.
02921	” “Do we have enough gold to buy a ship?” “And who will sail her? You? Me?” Dornishmen had never been seafarers, not since Nymeria burned her ten thousand ships.
02922	“The seas around Valyria are perilous, and thick with corsairs.
02923	” “I have had enough of corsairs.
02924	Let’s not buy a ship.
02925	” This is still just a game to him, Quentyn realized, no different than the time he led six of us up into the mountains to find the old lair of the Vulture King.
02926	It was not in Gerris Drinkwater’s nature to imagine they might fail, let alone that they might die.
02927	Even the deaths of three friends had not served to chasten him, it would seem.
02928	He leaves that to me.
02929	He knows my nature is as cautious as his is bold.
02930	“Perhaps the big man is right,” Ser Gerris said.
02931	“Piss on the sea, we can finish the journey overland.
02932	” “You know why he says that,” Quentyn said.
02933	“He’d rather die than set foot on another ship.
02934	” The big man had been greensick every day of their voyage.
02935	In Lys, it had taken him four days to recover his strength.
02936	They’d had to take rooms in an inn so Maester Kedry could tuck him into a feather bed and feed him broths and potions until some pink returned to his cheeks.
02937	It was possible to go overland to Meereen, that much was true.
02938	The old Valyrian roads would take them there.
02939	Dragon roads, men called the great stone roadways of the Freehold, but the one that ran eastward from Volantis to Meereen had earned a more sinister name: the demon road.
02940	“The demon road is dangerous, and too slow,” Quentyn said.
02941	“Tywin Lannister will send his own men after the queen once word of her reaches King’s Landing.
02942	” His father had been certain of that.
02943	“His will come with knives.
02944	If they reach her first—” “Let’s hope her dragons will sniff them out and eat them,” said Gerris.
02945	“Well, if we cannot find a ship, and you will not let us ride, we had as well book passage back to Dorne.
02946	” Crawl back to Sunspear defeated, with my tail between my legs? His father’s disappointment would be more than Quentyn could bear, and the scorn of the Sand Snakes would be withering.
02947	Doran Martell had put the fate of Dorne into his hands, he could not fail him, not whilst life remained.
02948	Heat shimmers rose off the street as the hathay rattled and jounced along on its iron:rimmed wheels, giving a dreamlike quality to their surroundings.
02949	In amongst the warehouses and the wharves, shops and stalls of many sorts crowded the waterfront.
02950	Here fresh oysters could be bought, here iron chains and manacles, here cyvasse pieces carved of ivory and jade.
02951	Here were temples too, where sailors came to sacrifice to foreign gods, cheek by jowl with pillow houses where women called down from balconies to men below.
02952	“Have a look at that one,” Gerris urged, as they passed one pillow house.
02953	“I think she’s in love with you.
02954	” And how much does a whore’s love cost? Truth be told, girls made Quentyn anxious, especially the pretty ones.
02955	When first he’d come to Yronwood, he had been smitten with Ynys, the eldest of Lord Yronwood’s daughters.
02956	Though he never said a word about his feelings, he nursed his dreams for years … until the day she was dispatched to wed Ser Ryon Allyrion, the heir to Godsgrace.
02957	The last time he had seen her, she’d had one boy at her breast and another clinging to her skirts.
02958	After Ynys had come the Drinkwater twins, a pair of tawny young maidens who loved hawking, hunting, climbing rocks, and making Quentyn blush.
02959	One of them had given him his first kiss, though he never knew which one.
02960	As daughters of a landed knight, the twins were too lowborn to marry, but Cletus did not think that was any reason to stop kissing them.
02961	“After you’re wed you can take one of them for a paramour.
02962	Or both, why not?” But Quentyn thought of several reasons why not, so he had done his best to avoid the twins thereafter, and there had been no second kiss.
02963	More recently, the youngest of Lord Yronwood’s daughters had taken to following him about the castle.
02964	Gwyneth was but twelve, a small, scrawny girl whose dark eyes and brown hair set her apart in that house of blue:eyed blondes.
02965	She was clever, though, as quick with words as with her hands, and fond of telling Quentyn that he had to wait for her to flower, so she could marry him.
02966	That was before Prince Doran had summoned him to the Water Gardens.
02967	And now the most beautiful woman in the world was waiting in Meereen, and he meant to do his duty and claim her for his bride.
02968	She will not refuse me.
02969	She will honor the agreement.
02970	Daenerys Targaryen would need Dorne to win the Seven Kingdoms, and that meant that she would need him.
02971	It does not mean that she will love me, though.
02972	She may not even like me.
02973	The street curved where the river met the sea, and there along the bend a number of animal sellers were clustered together, offering jeweled lizards, giant banded snakes, and agile little monkeys with striped tails and clever pink hands.
02974	“Perhaps your silver queen would like a monkey,” said Gerris.
02975	Quentyn had no idea what Daenerys Targaryen might like.
02976	He had promised his father that he would bring her back to Dorne, but more and more he wondered if he was equal to the task.
02977	I never asked for this, he thought.
02978	Across the wide blue expanse of the Rhoyne, he could see the Black Wall that had been raised by the Valyrians when Volantis was no more than an outpost of their empire: a great oval of fused stone two hundred feet high and so thick that six four:horse chariots could race around its top abreast, as they did each year to celebrate the founding of the city.
02979	Outlanders, foreigners, and freedmen were not allowed inside the Black Wall save at the invitation of those who dwelt within, scions of the Old Blood who could trace their ancestry back to Valyria itself.
02980	The traffic was thicker here.
02981	They were near the western end of the Long Bridge, which linked the two halves of the city.
02982	Wayns and carts and hathays crowded the streets, all of them coming from the bridge or making for it.
02983	Slaves were everywhere, as numerous as roaches, scurrying about their masters’ business.
02984	Not far from Fishermonger’s Square and the Merchant’s House, shouts erupted from a cross street, and a dozen Unsullied spearmen in ornate armor and tiger:skin cloaks appeared as if from nowhere, waving everyone aside so the triarch could pass through atop his elephant.
02985	The triarch’s elephant was a grey:skinned behemoth clad in elaborate enameled armor that clattered softly as he moved, the castle on its back so tall that it scraped the top of the ornamental stone arch he was passing underneath.
02986	“The triarchs are considered so elevated that their feet are not allowed to touch the ground during their year of service,” Quentyn informed his companion.
02987	“They ride everywhere on elephants.
02988	” “Blocking up the streets and leaving heaps of dung for the likes of us to contend with,” said Gerris.
02989	“Why Volantis needs three princes when Dorne makes do with one, I will never know.
02990	” “The triarchs are neither kings nor princes.
02991	Volantis is a freehold, like Valyria of old.
02992	All freeborn landholders share the rule.
02993	Even women are allowed to vote, provided they own land.
02994	The three triarchs are chosen from amongst those noble families who can prove unbroken descent from old Valyria, to serve until the first day of the new year.
02995	And you would know all this if you had troubled to read the book that Maester Kedry gave you.
02996	” “It had no pictures.
02997	” “There were maps.
02998	” “Maps do not count.
02999	If he had told me it was about tigers and elephants, I might have given it a try.
03000	It looked suspiciously like a history.
03001	” When their hathay reached the edge of the Fishermonger’s Square, their elephant lifted her trunk and made a honking noise like some huge white goose, reluctant to plunge into the tangle of wayns, palanquins, and foot traffic ahead.
03002	Their driver prodded her with his heel and kept her moving.
03003	The fishmongers were out in strength, crying the morning catch.
03004	Quentyn understood one word in two at best, but he did not need to know the words to know the fish.
03005	He saw cod and sailfish and sardines, barrels of mussels and clams.
03006	Eels hung along the front of one stall.
03007	Another displayed a gigantic turtle, strung up by its legs on iron chains, heavy as a horse.
03008	Crabs scrabbled inside casks of brine and seaweed.
03009	Several of the vendors were frying chunks of fish with onions and beets, or selling peppery fish stew out of small iron kettles.
03010	In the center of the square, under the cracked and headless statue of a dead triarch, a crowd had begun to gather about some dwarfs putting on a show.
03011	The little men were done up in wooden armor, miniature knights preparing for a joust.
03012	Quentyn saw one mount a dog, as the other hopped onto a pig … only to slide right off again, to a smattering of laughter.
03013	“They look amusing,” Gerris said.
03014	“Shall we stop and watch them fight? A laugh might serve you well, Quent.
03015	You look like an old man who has not moved his bowels in half a year.
03016	” I am eight:and:ten, six years younger than you, Quentyn thought.
03017	I am no old man.
03018	Instead he said, “I have no need for comic dwarfs.
03019	Unless they have a ship.
03020	” “A small one, I would think.
03021	” Four stories tall, the Merchant’s House dominated the docks and wharves and storehouses that surrounded it.
03022	Here traders from Oldtown and King’s Landing mingled with their counterparts from Braavos and Pentos and Myr, with hairy Ibbenese, pale:skinned voyagers from Qarth, coal:black Summer Islanders in feathered cloaks, even masked shadow:binders from Asshai by the Shadow.
03023	The paving stones felt warm beneath his feet when Quentyn climbed down from the hathay, even through the leather of his boots.
03024	Outside the Merchant’s House a trestle table had been set up in the shade and decorated with striped blue:and:white pennons that fluttered at every breath of air.
03025	Four hard:eyed sellswords lounged around the table, calling out to every passing man and boy.
03026	Windblown, Quentyn knew.
03027	The serjeants were looking for fresh meat to fill their ranks before they sailed for Slaver’s Bay.
03028	And every man who signs with them is another sword for Yunkai, another blade meant to drink the blood of my bride:to:be.
03029	One of the Windblown shouted at them.
03030	“I do not speak your tongue,” Quentyn answered.
03031	Though he could read and write High Valyrian, he had little practice speaking it.
03032	And the Volantene apple had rolled a fair distance from the Valyrian tree.
03033	“Westerosi?” the man answered, in the Common Tongue.
03034	“Dornishmen.
03035	My master is a wineseller.
03036	” “Master? Fuck that.
03037	Are you a slave? Come with us and be your own master.
03038	Do you want to die abed? We’ll teach you sword and spear.
03039	You’ll ride to battle with the Tattered Prince and come home richer than a lord.
03040	Boys, girls, gold, whatever you want, if you’re man enough to take it.
03041	We’re the Windblown, and we fuck the goddess slaughter up her arse.
03042	” Two of the sellswords began to sing, bellowing out the words to some marching song.
03043	Quentyn understood enough to get the gist.
03044	We are the Windblown, they sang.
03045	Blow us east to Slaver’s Bay, we’ll kill the butcher king and fuck the dragon queen.
03046	“If Cletus and Will were still with us, we could come back with the big man and kill the lot of them,” said Gerris.
03047	Cletus and Will are dead.
03048	“Pay them no mind,” Quentyn said.
03049	The sellswords threw taunts at their backs as they pushed through the doors of the Merchant’s House, mocking them as bloodless cravens and frightened girls.
03050	The big man was waiting in their rooms on the second floor.
03051	Though the inn had come well recommended by the master of the Meadowlark, that did not mean Quentyn was willing to leave their goods and gold unguarded.
03052	Every port had thieves, rats, and whores, and Volantis had more than most.
03053	“I was about to go out looking for you,” Ser Archibald Yronwood said as he slid the bar back to admit them.
03054	It was his cousin Cletus who had started calling him the big man, but the name was well deserved.
03055	Arch was six:and:a:half:feet tall, broad of shoulder, huge of belly, with legs like tree trunks, hands the size of hams, and no neck to speak of.
03056	Some childhood malady had made all his hair fall out.
03057	His bald head reminded Quentyn of a smooth pink boulder.
03058	“So,” he demanded, “what did the smuggler say? Do we have a boat?” “A ship,” corrected Quentyn.
03059	“Aye, he’ll take us, but only as far as the nearest hell.
03060	” Gerris sat upon a sagging bed and pulled off his boots.
03061	“Dorne is sounding more attractive every moment.
03062	” The big man said, “I still say we would do better to ride the demon road.
03063	Might be it’s not as perilous as men say.
03064	And if it is, that only means more glory for those who dare it.
03065	Who would dare molest us? Drink with his sword, me with my hammer, that’s more than any demon could digest.
03066	” “And if Daenerys is dead before we reach her?” Quentyn said.
03067	“We must have a ship.
03068	Even if it is Adventure.
03069	” Gerris laughed.
03070	“You must be more desperate for Daenerys than I knew if you’d endure that stench for months on end.
03071	After three days, I’d be begging them to murder me.
03072	No, my prince, I pray you, not Adventure.
03073	” “Do you have a better way?” Quentyn asked him.
03074	“I do.
03075	It’s just now come to me.
03076	It has its risks, and it is not what you would call honorable, I grant you … but it will get you to your queen quicker than the demon road.
03077	” “Tell me,” said Quentyn Martell.
03078	JON Jon Snow read the letter over until the words began to blur and run together.
03079	I cannot sign this.
03080	I will not sign this.
03081	He almost burned the parchment then and there.
03082	Instead he took a sip of ale, the dregs of the half cup that remained from his solitary supper the night before.
03083	I have to sign it.
03084	They chose me to be their lord commander.
03085	The Wall is mine, and the Watch as well.
03086	The Night’s Watch takes no part.
03087	It was a relief when Dolorous Edd Tollett opened the door to tell him that Gilly was without.
03088	Jon set Maester Aemon’s letter aside.
03089	“I will see her.
03090	” He dreaded this.
03091	“Find Sam for me.
03092	I will want to speak with him next.
03093	” “He’ll be down with the books.
03094	My old septon used to say that books are dead men talking.
03095	Dead men should keep quiet, is what I say.
03096	No one wants to hear a dead man’s yabber.
03097	” Dolorous Edd went off muttering of worms and spiders.
03098	When Gilly entered, she went at once to her knees.
03099	Jon came around the table and drew her to her feet.
03100	“You don’t need to take a knee for me.
03101	That’s just for kings.
03102	” Though a wife and mother, Gilly still seemed half a child to him, a slender little thing wrapped up in one of Sam’s old cloaks.
03103	The cloak was so big on her that she could have hidden several other girls beneath its folds.
03104	“The babes are well?” he asked her.
03105	The wildling girl smiled timidly from under her cowl.
03106	“Yes, m’lord.
03107	I was scared I wouldn’t have milk enough for both, but the more they suck, the more I have.
03108	They’re strong.
03109	” “I have something hard to tell you.
03110	” He almost said ask, but caught himself at the last instant.
03111	“Is it Mance? Val begged the king to spare him.
03112	She said she’d let some kneeler marry her and never slit his throat if only Mance could live.
03113	That Lord o’Bones, he’s to be spared.
03114	Craster always swore he’d kill him if he ever showed his face about the keep.
03115	Mance never did half the things he done.
03116	” All Mance ever did was lead an army down upon the realm he once swore to protect.
03117	“Mance said our words, Gilly.
03118	Then he turned his cloak, wed Dalla, and crowned himself King:Beyond:the:Wall.
03119	His life is in the king’s hands now.
03120	It’s not him we need to talk about.
03121	It’s his son.
03122	Dalla’s boy.
03123	” “The babe?” Her voice trembled.
03124	“He never broke no oath, m’lord.
03125	He sleeps and cries and sucks, is all:: he’s never done no harm to no one.
03126	Don’t let her burn him.
03127	Save him, please.
03128	” “Only you can do that, Gilly.
03129	” Jon told her how.
03130	Another woman would have shrieked at him, cursed him, damned him down to seven hells.
03131	Another woman might have flown at him in rage, slapped him, kicked him, raked at his eyes with her nails.
03132	Another woman might have thrown her defiance in his teeth.
03133	Gilly shook her head.
03134	“No.
03135	Please, no.
03136	” The raven picked up the word.
03137	“No,” it screamed.
03138	“Refuse, and the boy will burn.
03139	Not on the morrow, nor the day after … but soon, whenever Melisandre needs to wake a dragon or raise a wind or work some other spell requiring king’s blood.
03140	Mance will be ash and bone by then, so she will claim his son for the fire, and Stannis will not deny her.
03141	If you do not take the boy away, she will burn him.
03142	” “I’ll go,” said Gilly.
03143	“I’ll take him, I’ll take the both o’ them, Dalla’s boy and mine.
03144	” Tears rolled down her cheeks.
03145	If not for the way the candle made them glisten, Jon might never have known that she was weeping.
03146	Craster’s wives would have taught their daughters to shed their tears into a pillow.
03147	Perhaps they went outside to weep, well away from Craster’s fists.
03148	Jon closed the fingers of his sword hand.
03149	“Take both boys and the queen’s men will ride after you and drag you back.
03150	The boy will still burn … and you with him.
03151	” If I comfort her, she may think that tears can move me.
03152	She has to realize that I will not yield.
03153	“You’ll take one boy, and that one Dalla’s.
03154	” “A mother can’t leave her son, or else she’s cursed forever.
03155	Not a son.
03156	We saved him, Sam and me.
03157	Please.
03158	Please, m’lord.
03159	We saved him from the cold.
03160	” “Men say that freezing to death is almost peaceful.
03161	Fire, though … do you see the candle, Gilly?” She looked at the flame.
03162	“Yes.
03163	” “Touch it.
03164	Put your hand over the flame.
03165	” Her big brown eyes grew bigger still.
03166	She did not move.
03167	“Do it.
03168	” Kill the boy.
03169	“Now.
03170	” Trembling, the girl reached out her hand, held it well above the flickering candle flame.
03171	“Down.
03172	Let it kiss you.
03173	” Gilly lowered her hand.
03174	An inch.
03175	Another.
03176	When the flame licked her flesh, she snatched her hand back and began to sob.
03177	“Fire is a cruel way to die.
03178	Dalla died to give this child life, but you have nourished him, cherished him.
03179	You saved your own boy from the ice.
03180	Now save hers from the fire.
03181	” “They’ll burn my babe, then.
03182	The red woman.
03183	If she can’t have Dalla’s, she’ll burn mine.
03184	” “Your son has no king’s blood.
03185	Melisandre gains nothing by giving him to the fire.
03186	Stannis wants the free folk to fight for him, he will not burn an innocent without good cause.
03187	Your boy will be safe.
03188	I will find a wet nurse for him and he’ll be raised here at Castle Black under my protection.
03189	He’ll learn to hunt and ride, to fight with sword and axe and bow.
03190	I’ll even see that he is taught to read and write.
03191	” Sam would like that.
03192	“And when he is old enough, he will learn the truth of who he is.
03193	He’ll be free to seek you out if that is what he wants.
03194	” “You will make a crow of him.
03195	” She wiped at her tears with the back of a small pale hand.
03196	“I won’t.
03197	I won’t.
03198	” Kill the boy, thought Jon.
03199	“You will.
03200	Else I promise you, the day that they burn Dalla’s boy, yours will die as well.
03201	” “Die,” shrieked the Old Bear’s raven.
03202	“Die, die, die.
03203	” The girl sat hunched and shrunken, staring at the candle flame, tears glistening in her eyes.
03204	Finally Jon said, “You have my leave to go.
03205	Do not speak of this, but see that you are ready to depart an hour before first light.
03206	My men will come for you.
03207	” Gilly got to her feet.
03208	Pale and wordless, she departed, with never a look back at him.
03209	Jon heard her footsteps as she rushed through the armory.
03210	She was almost running.
03211	When he went to close the door, Jon saw that Ghost was stretched out beneath the anvil, gnawing on the bone of an ox.
03212	The big white direwolf looked up at his approach.
03213	“Past time that you were back.
03214	” He returned to his chair, to read over Maester Aemon’s letter once again.
03215	Samwell Tarly turned up a few moments later, clutching a stack of books.
03216	No sooner had he entered than Mormont’s raven flew at him demanding corn.
03217	Sam did his best to oblige, offering some kernels from the sack beside the door.
03218	The raven did its best to peck through his palm.
03219	Sam yowled, the bird flapped off, corn scattered.
03220	“Did that wretch break the skin?” Jon asked.
03221	Sam gingerly removed his glove.
03222	“He did.
03223	I’m bleeding.
03224	” “We all shed our blood for the Watch.
03225	Wear thicker gloves.
03226	” Jon shoved a chair toward him with a foot.
03227	“Sit, and have a look at this.
03228	” He handed Sam the parchment.
03229	“What is it?” “A paper shield.
03230	” Sam read it slowly.
03231	“A letter to King Tommen?” “At Winterfell, Tommen fought my brother Bran with wooden swords,” Jon said, remembering.
03232	“He wore so much padding he looked like a stuffed goose.
03233	Bran knocked him to the ground.
03234	” He went to the window and threw the shutters open.
03235	The air outside was cold and bracing, though the sky was a dull grey.
03236	“Yet Bran’s dead, and pudgy pink:faced Tommen is sitting on the Iron Throne, with a crown nestled amongst his golden curls.
03237	” That got an odd look from Sam, and for a moment he looked as if he wanted to say something.
03238	Instead he swallowed and turned back to the parchment.
03239	“You haven’t signed the letter.
03240	” Jon shook his head.
03241	“The Old Bear begged the Iron Throne for help a hundred times.
03242	They sent him Janos Slynt.
03243	No letter will make the Lannisters love us better.
03244	Not once they hear that we’ve been helping Stannis.
03245	” “Only to defend the Wall, not in his rebellion.
03246	That’s what it says here.
03247	” “The distinction may escape Lord Tywin.
03248	” Jon snatched the letter back.
03249	“Why would he help us now? He never did before.
03250	” “Well, he will not want it said that Stannis rode to the defense of the realm whilst King Tommen was playing with his toys.
03251	That would bring scorn down upon House Lannister.
03252	” “It’s death and destruction I want to bring down upon House Lannister, not scorn.
03253	” Jon read from the letter.
03254	“The Night’s Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.
03255	Our oaths are sworn to the realm, and the realm now stands in dire peril.
03256	Stannis Baratheon aids us against our foes from beyond the Wall, though we are not his men …” Sam squirmed in his seat.
03257	“Well, we’re not.
03258	Are we?” “I gave Stannis food, shelter, and the Nightfort, plus leave to settle some free folk in the Gift.
03259	That’s all.
03260	” “Lord Tywin will say it was too much.
03261	” “Stannis says it’s not enough.
03262	The more you give a king, the more he wants.
03263	We are walking on a bridge of ice with an abyss on either side.
03264	Pleasing one king is difficult enough.
03265	Pleasing two is hardly possible.
03266	” “Yes, but … if the Lannisters should prevail and Lord Tywin decides that we betrayed the king by aiding Stannis, it could mean the end of the Night’s Watch.
03267	He has the Tyrells behind him, with all the strength of Highgarden.
03268	And he did defeat Lord Stannis on the Blackwater.
03269	” “The Blackwater was one battle.
03270	Robb won all his battles and still lost his head.
03271	If Stannis can raise the north …” Sam hesitated, then said, “The Lannisters have northmen of their own.
03272	Lord Bolton and his bastard.
03273	” “Stannis has the Karstarks.
03274	If he can win White Harbor …” “If,” Sam stressed.
03275	“If not … my lord, even a paper shield is better than none.
03276	” “I suppose so.
03277	” Him and Aemon both.
03278	Somehow he had hoped that Sam Tarly might see it differently.
03279	It is only ink and parchment.
03280	Resigned, he grabbed the quill and signed.
03281	“Get the sealing wax.
03282	” Before I change my mind.
03283	Sam hastened to obey.
03284	Jon fixed the lord commander’s seal and handed him the letter.
03285	“Take this to Maester Aemon when you leave, and tell him to dispatch a bird to King’s Landing.
03286	” “I will.
03287	” Sam sounded relieved.
03288	“My lord, if I might ask … I saw Gilly leaving.
03289	She was almost crying.
03290	” “Val sent her to plead for Mance again,” Jon lied, and they talked for a while of Mance and Stannis and Melisandre of Asshai, until the raven ate the last corn kernel and screamed, “Blood.
03291	” “I am sending Gilly away,” Jon said.
03292	“Her and the boy.
03293	We will need to find another wet nurse for his milk brother.
03294	” “Goat’s milk might serve, until you do.
03295	It’s better for a babe than cow’s milk.
03296	” Talking about breasts plainly made Sam uncomfortable, and suddenly he began to speak of history, and boy commanders who had lived and died hundreds of years ago.
03297	Jon cut him off with, “Tell me something useful.
03298	Tell me of our enemy.
03299	” “The Others.
03300	” Sam licked his lips.
03301	“They are mentioned in the annals, though not as often as I would have thought.
03302	The annals I’ve found and looked at, that is.
03303	There’s more I haven’t found, I know.
03304	Some of the older books are falling to pieces.
03305	The pages crumble when I try and turn them.
03306	And the really old books … either they have crumbled all away or they are buried somewhere that I haven’t looked yet or … well, it could be that there are no such books and never were.
03307	The oldest histories we have were written after the Andals came to Westeros.
03308	The First Men only left us runes on rocks, so everything we think we know about the Age of Heroes and the Dawn Age and the Long Night comes from accounts set down by septons thousands of years later.
03309	There are archmaesters at the Citadel who question all of it.
03310	Those old histories are full of kings who reigned for hundreds of years, and knights riding around a thousand years before there were knights.
03311	You know the tales, Brandon the Builder, Symeon Star:Eyes, Night’s King … we say that you’re the nine:hundred:and:ninety:eighth Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, but the oldest list I’ve found shows six hundred seventy:four commanders, which suggests that it was written during—” “Long ago,” Jon broke in.
03312	“What about the Others?” “I found mention of dragonglass.
03313	The children of the forest used to give the Night’s Watch a hundred obsidian daggers every year, during the Age of Heroes.
03314	The Others come when it is cold, most of the tales agree.
03315	Or else it gets cold when they come.
03316	Sometimes they appear during snowstorms and melt away when the skies clear.
03317	They hide from the light of the sun and emerge by night … or else night falls when they emerge.
03318	Some stories speak of them riding the corpses of dead animals.
03319	Bears, direwolves, mammoths, horses, it makes no matter, so long as the beast is dead.
03320	The one that killed Small Paul was riding a dead horse, so that part’s plainly true.
03321	Some accounts speak of giant ice spiders too.
03322	I don’t know what those are.
03323	Men who fall in battle against the Others must be burned, or else the dead will rise again as their thralls.
03324	” “We knew all this.
03325	The question is, how do we fight them?” “The armor of the Others is proof against most ordinary blades, if the tales can be believed, and their own swords are so cold they shatter steel.
03326	Fire will dismay them, though, and they are vulnerable to obsidian.
03327	I found one account of the Long Night that spoke of the last hero slaying Others with a blade of dragonsteel.
03328	Supposedly they could not stand against it.
03329	” “Dragonsteel?” The term was new to Jon.
03330	“Valyrian steel?” “That was my first thought as well.
03331	” “So if I can just convince the lords of the Seven Kingdoms to give us their Valyrian blades, all is saved? That won’t be hard.
03332	” No harder than asking them to give up their coin and castles.
03333	He gave a bitter laugh.
03334	“Did you find who the Others are, where they come from, what they want?” “Not yet, my lord, but it may be that I’ve just been reading the wrong books.
03335	There are hundreds I have not looked at yet.
03336	Give me more time and I will find whatever there is to be found.
03337	” “There is no more time.
03338	You need to get your things together, Sam.
03339	You’re going with Gilly.
03340	” “Going?” Sam gaped at him openmouthed, as if he did not understand the meaning of the word.
03341	“I’m going? To Eastwatch, my lord? Or … where am I …” “Oldtown.
03342	” “Oldtown?” Sam repeated, in a high:pitched squeak.
03343	“Aemon as well.
03344	” “Aemon? Maester Aemon? But … he’s one hundred and two years old, my lord, he can’t … you’re sending him and me? Who will tend the ravens? If there’s sick or wounded, who …” “Clydas.
03345	He’s been with Aemon for years.
03346	” “Clydas is only a steward, and his eyes are going bad.
03347	You need a maester.
03348	Maester Aemon is so frail, a sea voyage … it might … he’s old, and …” “His life will be at risk.
03349	I am aware of that, Sam, but the risk is greater here.
03350	Stannis knows who Aemon is.
03351	If the red woman requires king’s blood for her spells …” “Oh.
03352	” Sam’s fat cheeks seemed to drain of color.
03353	“Dareon will join you at Eastwatch.
03354	My hope is that his songs will win some men for us in the south.
03355	The Blackbird will deliver you to Braavos.
03356	From there, you’ll arrange your own passage to Oldtown.
03357	If you still mean to claim Gilly’s babe as your bastard, send her and the child on to Horn Hill.
03358	Elsewise, Aemon will find a servant’s place for her at the Citadel.
03359	” “My b:b:bastard.
03360	Yes, I … my mother and my sisters will help Gilly with the child.
03361	Dareon could see her to Oldtown just as well as me.
03362	I’m … I’ve been working at my archery every afternoon with Ulmer, as you commanded … well, except when I’m in the vaults, but you told me to find out about the Others.
03363	The longbow makes my shoulders ache and raises blisters on my fingers.
03364	” He showed Jon his hand.
03365	“I still do it, though.
03366	I can hit the target more often than not now, but I’m still the worst archer who ever bent a bow.
03367	I like Ulmer’s stories, though.
03368	Someone needs to write them down and put them in a book.
03369	” “You do it.
03370	They have parchment and ink at the Citadel, as well as longbows.
03371	I will expect you to continue with your practice.
03372	Sam, the Night’s Watch has hundreds of men who can loose an arrow, but only a handful who can read or write.
03373	I need you to become my new maester.
03374	” “My lord, I … my work is here, the books …” “… will be here when you return to us.
03375	” Sam put a hand to his throat.
03376	“My lord, the Citadel … they make you cut up corpses there.
03377	I cannot wear a chain.
03378	” “You can.
03379	You will.
03380	Maester Aemon is old and blind.
03381	His strength is leaving him.
03382	Who will take his place when he dies? Maester Mullin at the Shadow Tower is more fighter than scholar, and Maester Harmune of Eastwatch is drunk more than he’s sober.
03383	” “If you ask the Citadel for more maesters …” “I mean to.
03384	We’ll have need of every one.
03385	Aemon Targaryen is not so easily replaced, however.
03386	” This is not going as I had hoped.
03387	He had known Gilly would be hard, but he had assumed Sam would be glad to trade the dangers of the Wall for the warmth of Oldtown.
03388	“I was certain this would please you,” he said, puzzled.
03389	“There are so many books at the Citadel that no man can hope to read them all.
03390	You would do well there, Sam.
03391	I know you would.
03392	” “No.
03393	I could read the books, but … a m:maester must be a healer and b:b:blood makes me faint.
03394	” His hand shook, to prove the truth of that.
03395	“I’m Sam the Scared, not Sam the Slayer.
03396	” “Scared? Of what? The chidings of old men? Sam, you saw the wights come swarming up the Fist, a tide of living dead men with black hands and bright blue eyes.
03397	You slew an Other.
03398	” “It was the d:d:d:dragonglass, not me.
03399	” “Be quiet,” Jon snapped.
03400	After Gilly, he had no patience for the fat boy’s fears.
03401	“You lied and schemed and plotted to make me lord commander.
03402	You will obey me.
03403	You’ll go to the Citadel and forge a chain, and if you have to cut up corpses, so be it.
03404	At least in Oldtown the corpses won’t object.
03405	” “My lord, my f:f:f:father, Lord Randyll, he, he, he, he, he … the life of a maester is a life of servitude.
03406	No son of House Tarly will ever wear a chain.
03407	The men of Horn Hill do not bow and scrape to petty lords.
03408	Jon, I cannot disobey my father.
03409	” Kill the boy, Jon thought.
03410	The boy in you, and the one in him.
03411	Kill the both of them, you bloody bastard.
03412	“You have no father.
03413	Only brothers.
03414	Only us.
03415	Your life belongs to the Night’s Watch, so go and stuff your small:clothes into a sack, along with anything else you care to take to Oldtown.
03416	You leave an hour before sunrise.
03417	And here’s another order.
03418	From this day forth, you will not call yourself a craven.
03419	You’ve faced more things this past year than most men face in a lifetime.
03420	You can face the Citadel, but you’ll face it as a Sworn Brother of the Night’s Watch.
03421	I can’t command you to be brave, but I can command you to hide your fears.
03422	You said the words, Sam.
03423	Remember?” “I … I’ll try.
03424	” “You won’t try.
03425	You will obey.
03426	” “Obey.
03427	” Mormont’s raven flapped its great black wings.
03428	Sam seemed to sag.
03429	“As my lord commands.
03430	Does … does Maester Aemon know?” “It was as much his idea as mine.
03431	” Jon opened the door for him.
03432	“No farewells.
03433	The fewer folk who know of this, the better.
03434	An hour before first light, by the lichyard.
03435	” Sam fled from him just as Gilly had.
03436	Jon was tired.
03437	I need sleep.
03438	He had been up half the night poring over maps, writing letters, and making plans with Maester Aemon.
03439	Even after stumbling into his narrow bed, rest had not come easily.
03440	He knew what he would face today, and found himself tossing restlessly as he brooded on Maester Aemon’s final words.
03441	“Allow me to give my lord one last piece of counsel,” the old man had said, “the same counsel that I once gave my brother when we parted for the last time.
03442	He was three:and:thirty when the Great Council chose him to mount the Iron Throne.
03443	A man grown with sons of his own, yet in some ways still a boy.
03444	Egg had an innocence to him, a sweetness we all loved.
03445	Kill the boy within you, I told him the day I took ship for the Wall.
03446	It takes a man to rule.
03447	An Aegon, not an Egg.
03448	Kill the boy and let the man be born.
03449	” The old man felt Jon’s face.
03450	“You are half the age that Egg was, and your own burden is a crueler one, I fear.
03451	You will have little joy of your command, but I think you have the strength in you to do the things that must be done.
03452	Kill the boy, Jon Snow.
03453	Winter is almost upon us.
03454	Kill the boy and let the man be born.
03455	” Jon donned his cloak and strode outside.
03456	He made the rounds of Castle Black each day, visiting the men on watch and hearing their reports first hand, watching Ulmer and his charges at the archery butts, talking with king’s men and queen’s men alike, walking the ice atop the Wall to have a look at the forest.
03457	Ghost padded after him, a white shadow at his side.
03458	Kedge Whiteye had the Wall when Jon made his ascent.
03459	Kedge had seen forty:odd namedays, thirty of them on the Wall.
03460	His left eye was blind, his right eye mean.
03461	In the wild, alone with axe and garron, he was as good a ranger as any in the Watch, but he had never gotten on well with the other men.
03462	“A quiet day,” he told Jon.
03463	“Nothing to report, except the wrong:way rangers.
03464	” “The wrong:way rangers?” Jon asked.
03465	Kedge grinned.
03466	“A pair of knights.
03467	Went riding off an hour ago, south along the kingsroad.
03468	When Dywen saw them buggering off, he said the southron fools were riding the wrong way.
03469	” “I see,” said Jon.
03470	He found out more from Dywen himself, as the old forester sucked down a bowl of barley broth in the barracks.
03471	“Aye, m’lord, I saw them.
03472	Horpe and Massey, it were.
03473	Claimed Stannis sent ’em out, but never said where or what for or when they would be back.
03474	” Ser Richard Horpe and Ser Justin Massey were both queen’s men, and high in the king’s councils.
03475	A pair of common freeriders would have served if all that Stannis had in mind was scouting, Jon Snow reflected, but knights are better suited to act as messengers or envoys.
03476	Cotter Pyke had sent word from Eastwatch that the Onion Lord and Salladhor Saan had set sail for White Harbor to treat with Lord Manderly.
03477	It made sense that Stannis would send out other envoys.
03478	His Grace was not a patient man.
03479	Whether the wrong:way rangers would return was another question.
03480	Knights they might be, but they did not know the north.
03481	There will be eyes along the kingsroad, not all of them friendly.
03482	It was none of Jon’s concern, though.
03483	Let Stannis have his secrets.
03484	The gods know that I have mine.
03485	Ghost slept at the foot of the bed that night, and for once Jon did not dream he was a wolf.
03486	Even so, he slept fitfully, tossing for hours before sliding down into a nightmare.
03487	Gilly was in it, weeping, pleading with him to leave her babes alone, but he ripped the children from her arms and hacked their heads off, then swapped the heads around and told her to sew them back in place.
03488	When he woke, he found Edd Tollett looming over him in the darkness of his bedchamber.
03489	“M’lord? It is time.
03490	The hour of the wolf.
03491	You left orders to be woken.
03492	” “Bring me something hot.
03493	” Jon threw off his blankets.
03494	Edd was back by the time that he had dressed, pressing a steaming cup into his hands.
03495	Jon expected hot mulled wine, and was surprised to find that it was soup, a thin broth that smelled of leeks and carrots but seemed to have no leeks or carrots in it.
03496	The smells are stronger in my wolf dreams, he reflected, and food tastes richer too.
03497	Ghost is more alive than I am.
03498	He left the empty cup upon the forge.
03499	Kegs was on his door this morning.
03500	“I will want to speak with Bedwyck and with Janos Slynt,” Jon told him.
03501	“Have them both here at first light.
03502	” Outside the world was black and still.
03503	Cold, but not dangerously cold.
03504	Not yet.
03505	It will be warmer when the sun comes up.
03506	If the gods are good, the Wall may weep.
03507	When they reached the lichyard, the column had already formed up.
03508	Jon had given Black Jack Bulwer command of the escort, with a dozen mounted rangers under him, and two wayns.
03509	One was piled high with chests and crates and sacks, provisions for the journey.
03510	The other had a stiff roof of boiled leather to keep the wind off.
03511	Maester Aemon was seated in the back of it, huddled in a bearskin that made him look as small as a child.
03512	Sam and Gilly stood nearby.
03513	Her eyes were red and puffy, but the boy was in her arms, bundled tight.
03514	Whether it was her boy or Dalla’s he could not be sure.
03515	He had only seen the two together a few times.
03516	Gilly’s boy was older, Dalla’s more robust, but they were close enough in age and size so that no one who did not know them well would be able to easily tell one from the other.
03517	“Lord Snow,” Maester Aemon called out, “I left a book for you in my chambers.
03518	The Jade Compendium.
03519	It was written by the Volantene adventurer Colloquo Votar, who traveled to the east and visited all the lands of the Jade Sea.
03520	There is a passage you may find of interest.
03521	I’ve told Clydas to mark it for you.
03522	” “I’ll be sure to read it.
03523	” Maester Aemon wiped his nose.
03524	“Knowledge is a weapon, Jon.
03525	Arm yourself well before you ride forth to battle.
03526	” “I will.
03527	” Jon felt something wet and cold upon his face.
03528	When he raised his eyes, he saw that it was snowing.
03529	A bad omen.
03530	He turned to Black Jack Bulwer.
03531	“Make as good a time as you can, but take no foolish risks.
03532	You have an old man and a suckling babe with you.
03533	See that you keep them warm and well fed.
03534	” “You do the same, m’lord.
03535	” Gilly did not seem in any haste to climb into the wayn.
03536	“You do the same for t’other.
03537	Find another wet nurse, like you said.
03538	You promised me you would.
03539	The boy … Dalla’s boy … the little prince, I mean … you find him some good woman, so he grows up big and strong.
03540	” “You have my word.
03541	” “Don’t you name him.
03542	Don’t you do that, till he’s past two years.
03543	It’s ill luck to name them when they’re still on the breast.
03544	You crows may not know that, but it’s true.
03545	” “As you command, my lady.
03546	” “Don’t you call me that.
03547	I’m a mother, not a lady.
03548	I’m Craster’s wife and Craster’s daughter, and a mother.
03549	” She gave the babe to Dolorous Edd as she climbed into the wayn and covered herself with furs.
03550	When Edd gave her back the child, Gilly put him to her breast.
03551	Sam turned away from the sight, red:faced, and heaved himself up onto his mare.
03552	“Let’s do this,” commanded Black Jack Bulwer, snapping his whip.
03553	The wayns rolled forward.
03554	Sam lingered a moment.
03555	“Well,” he said, “farewell.
03556	” “And to you, Sam,” said Dolorous Edd.
03557	“Your boat’s not like to sink, I don’t think.
03558	Boats only sink when I’m aboard.
03559	” Jon was remembering.
03560	“The first time I saw Gilly she was pressed back against the wall of Craster’s Keep, this skinny darkhaired girl with her big belly, cringing away from Ghost.
03561	He had gotten in among her rabbits, and I think she was frightened that he would tear her open and devour the babe … but it was not the wolf she should have been afraid of, was it?” “She has more courage than she knows,” said Sam.
03562	“So do you, Sam.
03563	Have a swift, safe voyage, and take care of her and Aemon and the child.
03564	” The cold trickles on his face reminded Jon of the day he’d bid farewell to Robb at Winterfell, never knowing that it was for the last time.
03565	“And pull your hood up.
03566	The snowflakes are melting in your hair.
03567	” By the time the little column had dwindled in the distance, the eastern sky had gone from black to grey and the snow was falling heavily.
03568	“Giant will be waiting on the lord commander’s pleasure,” Dolorous Edd reminded him.
03569	“Janos Slynt as well.
03570	” “Yes.
03571	” Jon Snow glanced up at the Wall, towering over them like a cliff of ice.
03572	A hundred leagues from end to end, and seven hundred feet high.
03573	The strength of the Wall was its height:: the length of the Wall was its weakness.
03574	Jon remembered something his father had said once.
03575	A wall is only as strong as the men who stand behind it.
03576	The men of the Night’s Watch were brave enough, but they were far too few for the task that confronted them.
03577	Giant was waiting in the armory.
03578	His real name was Bedwyck.
03579	At a hair and a half over five feet he was the smallest man in the Night’s Watch.
03580	Jon came directly to the point.
03581	“We need more eyes along the Wall.
03582	Way:castles where our patrols can get out of the cold and find hot food and a fresh mount.
03583	I am putting a garrison in Icemark and giving you command of it.
03584	” Giant put the tip of his little finger in his ear to clean out the wax.
03585	“Command? Me? M’lord knows I’m just a crofter’s get, on the Wall for poaching?” “You’ve been a ranger for a dozen years.
03586	You survived the Fist of the First Men and Craster’s Keep, and came back to tell the tale.
03587	The younger men look up to you.
03588	” The small man laughed.
03589	“Only dwarfs look up to me.
03590	I don’t read, my lord.
03591	On a good day I can write my name.
03592	” “I’ve sent to Oldtown for more maesters.
03593	You’ll have two ravens for when your need is urgent.
03594	When it’s not, send riders.
03595	Until we have more maesters and more birds, I mean to establish a line of beacon towers along the top of the Wall.
03596	” “And how many poor fools will I be commanding?” “Twenty, from the Watch,” said Jon, “and half as many men from Stannis.
03597	” Old, green, or wounded.
03598	“They won’t be his best men, and none will take the black, but they’ll obey.
03599	Make what use of them you can.
03600	Four of the brothers I’m sending with you will be Kingslanders who came to the Wall with Lord Slynt.
03601	Keep one eye on that lot and watch for climbers with the other.
03602	” “We can watch, m’lord, but if enough climbers gain the top o’ the Wall, thirty men won’t be enough to throw them off.
03603	” Three hundred might not be enough.
03604	Jon kept that doubt to himself.
03605	It was true that climbers were desperately vulnerable whilst on the ascent.
03606	Stones and spears and pots of burning pitch could be rained down on them from above, and all they could do was cling desperately to the ice.
03607	Sometimes the Wall itself seemed to shake them off, as a dog might shake off fleas.
03608	Jon had seen that for himself, when a sheet of ice cracked beneath Val’s lover Jarl, sending him to his death.
03609	If the climbers reached the top of the Wall undetected, however, everything changed.
03610	Given time, they could carve out a toehold for themselves up there, throwing up ramparts of their own and dropping ropes and ladders for thousands more to clamber over after them.
03611	That was how Raymun Redbeard had done it, Raymun who had been King:Beyond:the:Wall in the days of his grandfather’s grandfather.
03612	Jack Musgood had been the lord commander in those days.
03613	Jolly Jack, he was called before Redbeard came down upon the north:: Sleepy Jack, forever after.
03614	Raymun’s host had met a bloody end on the shores of Long Lake, caught between Lord Willam of Winterfell and the Drunken Giant, Harmond Umber.
03615	Red:beard had been slain by Artos the Implacable, Lord Willam’s younger brother.
03616	The Watch arrived too late to fight the wildlings, but in time to bury them, the task that Artos Stark assigned them in his wroth as he grieved above the headless corpse of his fallen brother.
03617	Jon did not intend to be remembered as Sleepy Jon Snow.
03618	“Thirty men will stand a better chance than none,” he told Giant.
03619	“True enough,” the small man said.
03620	“Is it just to be Icemark, then, or will m’lord be opening t’other forts as well?” “I mean to garrison all of them, in time,” said Jon, “but for the moment, it will just be Icemark and Greyguard.
03621	” “And has m’lord decided who’s to command at Greyguard?” “Janos Slynt,” said Jon.
03622	Gods save us.
03623	“A man does not rise to command of the gold cloaks without ability.
03624	Slynt was born a butcher’s son.
03625	He was captain of the Iron Gate when Manly Stokeworth died, and Jon Arryn raised him up and put the defense of King’s Landing into his hands.
03626	Lord Janos cannot be as great a fool as he seems.
03627	” And I want him well away from Alliser Thorne.
03628	“Might be that’s so,” said Giant, “but I’d still send him to the kitchens to help Three:Finger Hobb cut up the turnips.
03629	” If I did, I’d never dare to eat another turnip.
03630	Half the morning passed before Lord Janos reported as commanded.
03631	Jon was cleaning Longclaw.
03632	Some men would have given that task to a steward or a squire, but Lord Eddard had taught his sons to care for their own weapons.
03633	When Kegs and Dolorous Edd arrived with Slynt, Jon thanked them and bid Lord Janos sit.
03634	That he did, albeit with poor grace, crossing his arms, scowling, and ignoring the naked steel in his lord commander’s hands.
03635	Jon slid the oilcloth down his bastard sword, watching the play of morning light across the ripples, thinking how easily the blade would slide through skin and fat and sinew to part Slynt’s ugly head from his body.
03636	All of a man’s crimes were wiped away when he took the black, and all of his allegiances as well, yet he found it hard to think of Janos Slynt as a brother.
03637	There is blood between us.
03638	This man helped slay my father and did his best to have me killed as well.
03639	“Lord Janos.
03640	” Jon sheathed his sword.
03641	“I am giving you command of Greyguard.
03642	” That took Slynt aback.
03643	“Greyguard … Greyguard was where you climbed the Wall with your wildling friends …” “It was.
03644	The fort is in a sorry state, admittedly.
03645	You will restore it as best you can.
03646	Start by clearing back the forest.
03647	Steal stones from the structures that have collapsed to repair those still standing.
03648	” The work will be hard and brutal, he might have added.
03649	You’ll sleep on stone, too exhausted to complain or plot, and soon you’ll forget what it was like to be warm, but you might remember what it was to be a man.
03650	“You will have thirty men.
03651	Ten from here, ten from the Shadow Tower, and ten lent to us by King Stannis.
03652	” Slynt’s face had turned the color of a prune.
03653	His meaty jowls began to quiver.
03654	“Do you think I cannot see what you are doing? Janos Slynt is not a man to be gulled so easily.
03655	I was charged with the defense of King’s Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes.
03656	Keep your ruin, bastard.
03657	” I am giving you a chance, my lord.
03658	It is more than you ever gave my father.
03659	“You mistake me, my lord,” Jon said.
03660	“That was a command, not an offer.
03661	It is forty leagues to Greyguard.
03662	Pack up your arms and armor, say your farewells, and be ready to depart at first light on the morrow.
03663	” “No.
03664	” Lord Janos lurched to his feet, sending his chair crashing over backwards.
03665	“I will not go meekly off to freeze and die.
03666	No traitor’s bastard gives commands to Janos Slynt! I am not without friends, I warn you.
03667	Here, and in King’s Landing too.
03668	I was the Lord of Harrenhal! Give your ruin to one of the blind fools who cast a stone for you, I will not have it.
03669	Do you hear me, boy? I will not have it!” “You will.
03670	” Slynt did not deign to answer that, but he kicked the chair aside as he departed.
03671	He still sees me as a boy, Jon thought, a green boy, to be cowed by angry words.
03672	He could only hope that a night’s sleep would bring Lord Janos to his senses.
03673	The next morning proved that hope was vain.
03674	Jon found Slynt breaking his fast in the common room.
03675	Ser Alliser Thorne was with him, and several of their cronies.
03676	They were laughing about something when Jon came down the steps with Iron Emmett and Dolorous Edd, and behind them Mully, Horse, Red Jack Crabb, Rusty Flowers, and Owen the Oaf.
03677	Three:Finger Hobb was ladling out porridge from his kettle.
03678	Queen’s men, king’s men, and black brothers sat at their separate tables, some bent over bowls of porridge, others filling their bellies with fried bread and bacon.
03679	Jon saw Pyp and Grenn at one table, Bowen Marsh at another.
03680	The air smelled of smoke and grease, and the clatter of knives and spoons echoed off the vaulted ceiling.
03681	All the voices died at once.
03682	“Lord Janos,” Jon said, “I will give you one last chance.
03683	Put down that spoon and get to the stables.
03684	I have had your horse saddled and bridled.
03685	It is a long, hard road to Greyguard.
03686	” “Then you had best be on your way, boy.
03687	” Slynt laughed, dribbling porridge down his chest.
03688	“Greyguard’s a good place for the likes of you, I’m thinking.
03689	Well away from decent godly folk.
03690	The mark of the beast is on you, bastard.
03691	” “You are refusing to obey my order?” “You can stick your order up your bastard’s arse,” said Slynt, his jowls quivering.
03692	Alliser Thorne smiled a thin smile, his black eyes fixed on Jon.
03693	At another table, Godry the Giantslayer began to laugh.
03694	“As you will.
03695	” Jon nodded to Iron Emmett.
03696	“Please take Lord Janos to the Wall—” —and confine him to an ice cell, he might have said.
03697	A day or ten cramped up inside the ice would leave him shivering and feverish and begging for release, Jon did not doubt.
03698	And the moment he is out, he and Thorne will begin to plot again.
03699	—and tie him to his horse, he might have said.
03700	If Slynt did not wish to go to Greyguard as its commander, he could go as its cook.
03701	It will only be a matter of time until he deserts, then.
03702	And how many others will he take with him? “—and hang him,” Jon finished.
03703	Janos Slynt’s face went as white as milk.
03704	The spoon slipped from his fingers.
03705	Edd and Emmett crossed the room, their footsteps ringing on the stone floor.
03706	Bowen Marsh’s mouth opened and closed though no words came out.
03707	Ser Alliser Thorne reached for his sword hilt.
03708	Go on, Jon thought.
03709	Longclaw was slung across his back.
03710	Show your steel.
03711	Give me cause to do the same.
03712	Half the men in the hall were on their feet.
03713	Southron knights and men:at:arms, loyal to King Stannis or the red woman or both, and Sworn Brothers of the Night’s Watch.
03714	Some had chosen Jon to be their lord commander.
03715	Others had cast their stones for Bowen Marsh, Ser Denys Mal:lister, Cotter Pyke … and some for Janos Slynt.
03716	Hundreds of them, as I recall.
03717	Jon wondered how many of those men were in the cellar right now.
03718	For a moment the world balanced on a sword’s edge.
03719	Alliser Thorne took his hand from his sword and stepped aside to let Edd Tollett pass.
03720	Dolorous Edd took hold of Slynt by one arm, Iron Emmett by the other.
03721	Together they hauled him from the bench.
03722	“No,” Lord Janos protested, flecks of porridge spraying from his lips.
03723	“No, unhand me.
03724	He’s just a boy, a bastard.
03725	His father was a traitor.
03726	The mark of the beast is on him, that wolf of his … Let go of me! You will rue the day you laid hands on Janos Slynt.
03727	I have friends in King’s Landing.
03728	I warn you—” He was still protesting as they half:marched, half:dragged him up the steps.
03729	Jon followed them outside.
03730	Behind him, the cellar emptied.
03731	At the cage, Slynt wrenched loose for a moment and tried to make a fight of it, but Iron Emmett caught him by the throat and slammed him back against the iron bars until he desisted.
03732	By then all of Castle Black had come outside to watch.
03733	Even Val was at her window, her long golden braid across one shoulder.
03734	Stannis stood on the steps of the King’s Tower, surrounded by his knights.
03735	“If the boy thinks that he can frighten me, he is mistaken,” they heard Lord Janos said.
03736	“He would not dare to hang me.
03737	Janos Slynt has friends, important friends, you’ll see …” The wind whipped away the rest of his words.
03738	This is wrong, Jon thought.
03739	“Stop.
03740	” Emmett turned back, frowning.
03741	“My lord?” “I will not hang him,” said Jon.
03742	“Bring him here.
03743	” “Oh, Seven save us,” he heard Bowen Marsh cry out.
03744	The smile that Lord Janos Slynt smiled then had all the sweetness of rancid butter.
03745	Until Jon said, “Edd, fetch me a block,” and unsheathed Longclaw.
03746	By the time a suitable chopping block was found, Lord Janos had retreated into the winch cage, but Iron Emmett went in after him and dragged him out.
03747	“No,” Slynt cried, as Emmett half:shoved and half:pulled him across the yard.
03748	“Unhand me … you cannot … when Tywin Lannister hears of this, you will all rue—” Emmett kicked his legs out from under him.
03749	Dolorous Edd planted a foot on his back to keep him on his knees as Emmett shoved the block beneath his head.
03750	“This will go easier if you stay still,” Jon Snow promised him.
03751	“Move to avoid the cut, and you will still die, but your dying will be uglier.
03752	Stretch out your neck, my lord.
03753	” The pale morning sunlight ran up and down his blade as Jon clasped the hilt of the bastard sword with both hands and raised it high.
03754	“If you have any last words, now is the time to speak them,” he said, expecting one last curse.
03755	Janos Slynt twisted his neck around to stare up at him.
03756	“Please, my lord.
03757	Mercy.
03758	I’ll … I’ll go, I will, I …” No, thought Jon.
03759	You closed that door.
03760	Longclaw descended.
03761	“Can I have his boots?” asked Owen the Oaf, as Janos Slynt’s head went rolling across the muddy ground.
03762	“They’re almost new, those boots.
03763	Lined with fur.
03764	” Jon glanced back at Stannis.
03765	For an instant their eyes met.
03766	Then the king nodded and went back inside his tower.
03767	TYRION He woke alone, and found the litter halted.
03768	A pile of crushed cushions remained to show where Illyrio had sprawled.
03769	The dwarf’s throat felt dry and raspy.
03770	He had dreamed … what had he dreamed? He did not remember.
03771	Outside, voices were speaking in a tongue he did not know.
03772	Tyrion swung his legs through the curtains and hopped to the ground, to find Magister Illyrio standing by the horses with two riders looming over him.
03773	Both wore shirts of worn leather beneath cloaks of dark brown wool, but their swords were sheathed and the fat man did not look to be in danger.
03774	“I need a piss,” the dwarf announced.
03775	He waddled off the road, undid his breeches, and relieved himself into a tangle of thorns.
03776	It took quite a long time.
03777	“He pisses well, at least,” a voice observed.
03778	Tyrion flicked the last drops off and tucked himself away.
03779	“Pissing is the least of my talents.
03780	You ought to see me shit.
03781	” He turned to Magister Illyrio.
03782	“Are these two known to you, magister? They look like outlaws.
03783	Should I find my axe?” “Your axe?” exclaimed the larger of the riders, a brawny man with a shaggy beard and a shock of orange hair.
03784	“Did you hear that, Haldon? The little man wants to fight with us!” His companion was older, clean:shaved, with a lined ascetic face.
03785	His hair had been pulled back and tied in a knot behind his head.
03786	“Small men oft feel a need to prove their courage with unseemly boasts,” he declared.
03787	“I doubt if he could kill a duck.
03788	” Tyrion shrugged.
03789	“Fetch the duck.
03790	” “If you insist.
03791	” The rider glanced at his companion.
03792	The brawny man unsheathed a bastard sword.
03793	“I’m Duck, you mouthy little pisspot.
03794	” Oh, gods be good.
03795	“I had a smaller duck in mind.
03796	” The big man roared with laughter.
03797	“Did you hear, Haldon? He wants a smaller Duck!” “I should gladly settle for a quieter one.
03798	” The man called Haldon studied Tyrion with cool grey eyes before turning back to Illyrio.
03799	“You have some chests for us?” “And mules to carry them.
03800	” “Mules are too slow.
03801	We have pack horses, we’ll shift the chests to them.
03802	Duck, attend to that.
03803	” “Why is it always Duck who attends to things?” The big man slipped his sword back in its sheath.
03804	“What do you attend to, Haldon? Who is the knight here, you or me?” Yet he stomped off toward the baggage mules all the same.
03805	“How fares our lad?” asked Illyrio as the chests were being secured.
03806	Tyrion counted six, oaken chests with iron hasps.
03807	Duck shifted them easily enough, hoisting them on one shoulder.
03808	“He is as tall as Griff now.
03809	Three days ago he knocked Duck into a horse trough.
03810	” “I wasn’t knocked.
03811	I fell in just to make him laugh.
03812	” “Your ploy was a success,” said Haldon.
03813	“I laughed myself.
03814	” “There is a gift for the boy in one of the chests.
03815	Some candied ginger.
03816	He was always fond of it.
03817	” Illyrio sounded oddly sad.
03818	“I thought I might continue on to Ghoyan Drohe with you.
03819	A farewell feast before you start downriver …” “We have no time for feasts, my lord,” said Haldon.
03820	“Griff means to strike downriver the instant we are back.
03821	News has been coming upriver, none of it good.
03822	Dothraki have been seen north of Dagger Lake, outriders from old Motho’s khalasar, and Khal Zekko is not far behind him, moving through the Forest of Qohor.
03823	” The fat man made a rude noise.
03824	“Zekko visits Qohor every three or four years.
03825	The Qohorik give him a sack of gold and he turns east again.
03826	As for Motho, his men are near as old as he is, and there are fewer every year.
03827	The threat is—” “—Khal Pono,” Haldon finished.
03828	“Motho and Zekko flee from him, if the tales are true.
03829	The last reports had Pono near the headwaters of the Selhoru with a khalasar of thirty thousand.
03830	Griff does not want to risk being caught up in the crossing if Pono should decide to risk the Rhoyne.
03831	” Haldon glanced at Tyrion.
03832	“Does your dwarf ride as well as he pisses?” “He rides,” Tyrion broke in, before the lord of cheese could answer for him, “though he rides best with a special saddle and a horse that he knows well.
03833	He talks as well.
03834	” “So he does.
03835	I am Haldon, the healer in our little band of brothers.
03836	Some call me Halfmaester.
03837	My companion is Ser Duck.
03838	” “Ser Rolly,” said the big man.
03839	“Rolly Duckfield.
03840	Any knight can make a knight, and Griff made me.
03841	And you, dwarf?” Illyrio spoke up quickly.
03842	“Yollo, he is called.
03843	” Yollo? Yollo sounds like something you might name a monkey.
03844	Worse, it was a Pentoshi name, and any fool could see that Tyrion was no Pentoshi.
03845	“In Pentos I am Yollo,” he said quickly, to make what amends he could, “but my mother named me Hugor Hill.
03846	” “Are you a little king or a little bastard?” asked Haldon.
03847	Tyrion realized he would do well to be careful around Haldon Half:maester.
03848	“Every dwarf is a bastard in his father’s eyes.
03849	” “No doubt.
03850	Well, Hugor Hill, answer me this.
03851	How did Serwyn of the Mirror Shield slay the dragon Urrax?” “He approached behind his shield.
03852	Urrax saw only his own reflection until Serwyn had plunged his spear through his eye.
03853	” Haldon was unimpressed.
03854	“Even Duck knows that tale.
03855	Can you tell me the name of the knight who tried the same ploy with Vhagar during the Dance of the Dragons?” Tyrion grinned.
03856	“Ser Byron Swann.
03857	He was roasted for his trouble … only the dragon was Syrax, not Vhagar.
03858	” “I fear that you’re mistaken.
03859	In The Dance of the Dragons, A True Telling, Maester Munkun writes—” “—that it was Vhagar.
03860	Grand Maester Munkun errs.
03861	Ser Byron’s squire saw his master die, and wrote his daughter of the manner of it.
03862	His account says it was Syrax, Rhaenyra’s she:dragon, which makes more sense than Munken’s version.
03863	Swann was the son of a marcher lord, and Storm’s End was for Aegon.
03864	Vhagar was ridden by Prince Aemond, Aegon’s brother.
03865	Why should Swann want to slay her?” Haldon pursed his lips.
03866	“Try not to tumble off the horse.
03867	If you do, best waddle back to Pentos.
03868	Our shy maid will not wait for man nor dwarf.
03869	” “Shy maids are my favorite sort.
03870	Aside from wanton ones.
03871	Tell me, where do whores go?” “Do I look like a man who frequents whores?” Duck laughed derisively.
03872	“He don’t dare.
03873	Lemore would make him pray for pardon, the lad would want to come along, and Griff might cut his cock off and stuff it down his throat.
03874	” “Well,” said Tyrion, “a maester does not need a cock.
03875	” “Haldon’s only half a maester, though.
03876	” “You seem to find the dwarf amusing, Duck,” said Haldon.
03877	“He can ride with you.
03878	” He wheeled his mount about.
03879	It took another few moments for Duck to finish securing Illyrio’s chests to the three pack horses.
03880	By that time Haldon had vanished.
03881	Duck seemed unconcerned.
03882	He swung into the saddle, grabbed Tyrion by the collar, and hoisted the little man up in front of him.
03883	“Hold tight to the pommel and you’ll do fine.
03884	The mare’s got a nice sweet gait, and the dragon road’s smooth as a maiden’s arse.
03885	” Gathering the reins in his right hand and the leads in his left, Ser Rolly set off at a brisk trot.
03886	“Good fortune,” Illyrio called after them.
03887	“Tell the boy I am sorry that I will not be with him for his wedding.
03888	I will rejoin you in Westeros.
03889	That I swear, by my sweet Serra’s hands.
03890	” The last that Tyrion Lannister saw of Illyrio Mopatis, the magister was standing by his litter in his brocade robes, his massive shoulders slumped.
03891	As his figure dwindled in their dust, the lord of cheese looked almost small.
03892	Duck caught up with Haldon Halfmaester a quarter mile on.
03893	Thereafter the riders continued side by side.
03894	Tyrion clung to the high pommel with his short legs splayed out awkwardly, knowing he could look forward to blisters, cramps, and saddle sores.
03895	“I wonder what the pirates of Dagger Lake will make of our dwarf?” Haldon said as they rode on.
03896	“Dwarf stew?” suggested Duck.
03897	“Urho the Unwashed is the worst of them,” Haldon confided.
03898	“His stench alone is enough to kill a man.
03899	” Tyrion shrugged.
03900	“Fortunately, I have no nose.
03901	” Haldon gave him a thin smile.
03902	“If we should encounter the Lady Korra on Hag’s Teeth, you may soon be lacking other parts as well.
03903	Korra the Cruel, they call her.
03904	Her ship is crewed by beautiful young maids who geld every male they capture.
03905	” “Terrifying.
03906	I may well piss my breeches.
03907	” “Best not,” Duck warned darkly.
03908	“As you say.
03909	If we encounter this Lady Korra, I will just slip into a skirt and say that I am Cersei, the famous bearded beauty of King’s Landing.
03910	” This time Duck laughed, and Haldon said, “What a droll little fellow you are, Yollo.
03911	They say that the Shrouded Lord will grant a boon to any man who can make him laugh.
03912	Perhaps His Grey Grace will choose you to ornament his stony court.
03913	” Duck glanced at his companion uneasily.
03914	“It’s not good to jape of that one, not when we’re so near the Rhoyne.
03915	He hears.
03916	” “Wisdom from a duck,” said Haldon.
03917	“I beg your pardon, Yollo.
03918	You need not look so pale, I was only playing with you.
03919	The Prince of Sorrows does not bestow his grey kiss lightly.
03920	” His grey kiss.
03921	The thought made his flesh crawl.
03922	Death had lost its terror for Tyrion Lannister, but greyscale was another matter.
03923	The Shrouded Lord is just a legend, he told himself, no more real than the ghost of Lann the Clever that some claim haunts Casterly Rock.
03924	Even so, he held his tongue.
03925	The dwarf’s sudden silence went unnoticed, as Duck had begun to regale him with his own life story.
03926	His father had been an armorer at Bitterbridge, he said, so he had been born with the sound of steel ringing in his ears and had taken to swordplay at an early age.
03927	Such a large and likely lad drew the eye of old Lord Caswell, who offered him a place in his garrison, but the boy had wanted more.
03928	He watched Caswell’s weakling son named a page, a squire, and finally a knight.
03929	“A weedy pinch:faced sneak, he was, but the old lord had four daughters and only the one son, so no one was allowed to say a word against him.
03930	T’other squires hardly dared to lay a finger on him in the yard.
03931	” “You were not so timid, though.
03932	” Tyrion could see where this tale was going easily enough.
03933	“My father made a longsword for me to mark my sixteenth nameday,” said Duck, “but Lorent liked the look of it so much he took it for himself, and my bloody father never dared to tell him no.
03934	When I complained, Lorent told me to my face that my hand was made to hold a hammer, not a sword.
03935	So I went and got a hammer and beat him with it, till both his arms and half his ribs were broken.
03936	After that I had to leave the Reach, quick as it were.
03937	I made it across the water to the Golden Company.
03938	I did some smithing for a few years as a ’prentice, then Ser Harry Strickland took me on as squire.
03939	When Griff sent word downriver that he needed someone to help train his son to arms, Harry sent him me.
03940	” “And Griff knighted you?” “A year later.
03941	” Haldon Halfmaester smiled a thin smile.
03942	“Tell our little friend how you came by your name, why don’t you?” “A knight needs more than just the one name,” the big man insisted, “and, well, we were in a field when he dubbed me, and I looked up and saw these ducks, so … don’t laugh, now.
03943	” Just after sunset, they left the road to rest in an overgrown yard beside an old stone well.
03944	Tyrion hopped down to work the cramps out of his calves whilst Duck and Haldon were watering the horses.
03945	Tough brown grass and weed trees sprouted from the gaps between the cobbles, and the mossy walls of what once might have been a huge stone manse.
03946	After the animals had been tended to, the riders shared a simple supper of salt pork and cold white beans, washed down with ale.
03947	Tyrion found the plain fare a pleasant change from all the rich food he had eaten with Illyrio.
03948	“Those chests we brought you,” he said as they were chewing.
03949	“Gold for the Golden Company, I thought at first, until I saw Ser Rolly hoist a chest onto one shoulder.
03950	If it were full of coin, he could never have lifted it so easily.
03951	” “It’s just armor,” said Duck, with a shrug.
03952	“Clothing as well,” Haldon broke in.
03953	“Court clothes, for all our party.
03954	Fine woolens, velvets, silken cloaks.
03955	One does not come before a queen looking shabby … nor empty:handed.
03956	The magister has been kind enough to provide us with suitable gifts.
03957	” Come moonrise, they were back in their saddles, trotting eastward under a mantle of stars.
03958	The old Valyrian road glimmered ahead of them like a long silver ribbon winding through wood and dale.
03959	For a little while Tyrion Lannister felt almost at peace.
03960	“Lomas Longstrider told it true.
03961	The road’s a wonder.
03962	” “Lomas Longstrider?” asked Duck.
03963	“A scribe, long dead,” said Haldon.
03964	“He spent his life traveling the world and writing about the lands he visited in two books he called Wonders and Wonders Made by Man.
03965	” “An uncle of mine gave them to me when I was just a boy,” said Tyrion.
03966	“I read them until they fell to pieces.
03967	” “The gods made seven wonders, and mortal man made nine,” quoted the Halfmaester.
03968	“Rather impious of mortal man to do the gods two better, but there you are.
03969	The stone roads of Valyria were one of Longstrider’s nine.
03970	The fifth, I believe.
03971	” “The fourth,” said Tyrion, who had committed all sixteen of the wonders to memory as a boy.
03972	His uncle Gerion liked to set him on the table during feasts and make him recite them.
03973	I liked that well enough, didn’t I? Standing there amongst the trenchers with every eye upon me, proving what a clever little imp I was.
03974	For years afterward, he had cherished a dream that one day he would travel the world and see Longstrider’s wonders for himself.
03975	Lord Tywin had put an end to that hope ten days before his dwarf son’s sixteenth nameday, when Tyrion asked to tour the Nine Free Cities, as his uncles had done at that same age.
03976	“My brothers could be relied upon to bring no shame upon House Lannister,” his father had replied.
03977	“Neither ever wed a whore.
03978	” And when Tyrion had reminded him that in ten days he would be a man grown, free to travel where he wished, Lord Tywin had said, “No man is free.
03979	Only children and fools think elsewise.
03980	Go, by all means.
03981	Wear motley and stand upon your head to amuse the spice lords and the cheese kings.
03982	Just see that you pay your own way and put aside any thoughts of returning.
03983	” At that the boy’s defiance had crumbled.
03984	“If it is useful occupation you require, useful occupation you shall have,” his father then said.
03985	So to mark his manhood, Tyrion was given charge of all the drains and cisterns within Casterly Rock.
03986	Perhaps he hoped I’d fall into one.
03987	But Tywin had been disappointed in that.
03988	The drains never drained half so well as when he had charge of them.
03989	I need a cup of wine, to wash the taste of Tywin from my mouth.
03990	A skin of wine would serve me even better.
03991	They rode all night, with Tyrion sleeping fitfully, dozing against the pommel and waking suddenly.
03992	From time to time he would begin to slip sideways from the saddle, but Ser Rolly would get a hand on him and yank him upright once again.
03993	By dawn the dwarf’s legs were aching and his cheeks were chafed and raw.
03994	It was the next day before they reached the site of Ghoyan Drohe, hard beside the river.
03995	“The fabled Rhoyne,” said Tyrion when he glimpsed the slow green waterway from atop a rise.
03996	“The Little Rhoyne,” said Duck.
03997	“It is that.
03998	” A pleasant enough river, I suppose, but the smallest fork of the Trident is twice as wide, and all three of them run swifter.
03999	The city was no more impressive.
04000	Ghoyan Drohe had never been large, Tyrion recalled from his histories, but it had been a fair place, green and flowering, a city of canals and fountains.

2895	The prince also scrambled to realign himself with the United States while reasserting his friendship with that country’s enemies in Vietnam.
2896	These contradictory moves discredited him even further with his enemies inside the country, and by late 1969 high:ranking conservative officials had begun plotting against him.
2897	Whether or not they received encouragement from officers in the newly reopened US  embassy is a matter for speculation.
2898	10 The most prominent of the plotters was Sihanouk’s cousin, Sisowath Sirik Matak, a career civil servant who had become deputy prime minister under Lon Nol.
2899	Matak had grown impatient with Sihanouk’s mismanagement of the economy, and he was dismayed by the presence of Vietnamese bases on Cambodian soil and by his cousin’s impulsive, contradictory foreign policy.
2900	Pro:Western himself, and with links to Phnom Penh’s commercial elite, Matak was tired of playing a supporting role in Sihanouk’s never:ending opera.
2901	Lon Nol, the prime minister, was a more enigmatic figure.
2902	He is not known to have objected to the prince about the cutoff of US  aid, the alliance with the Communists, or the shipments of arms through Cambodian territory.
2903	Indeed, many of his officers became rich by dealing in arms, medicines, and supplies for which the Vietnamese paid generously.
2904	By 1969, however, Cambodian troops were under fire from Communist insurgents, and the Vietnamese administration of many base areas had drawn complaints from local people.
2905	Lon Nol was also under pressure from some of his officers who saw Cambodia’s isolation from US  aid and, by implication, from the Vietnam War as impediments to their financial ambitions.
2906	Moreover, Lon Nol was not immune to flattery, and he came to see himself as uniquely capable of saving Cambodia from the thmil, or “unbelievers,  as he called the Vietnamese hammering at his country’s gates.
2907	While pressures were mounting, Sihanouk’s interest in governing declined.
2908	Years of overwork had worn him down, and his inability or unwillingness to attract and keep young, competent advisers had begun to tell.
2909	His decision to open a casino in Phnom Penh to raise revenue had disastrous results.
2910	In the last six months of 1969, thousands of Cambodians lost millions of dollars at its tables.
2911	Several prominent people, and dozens of impoverished ones, committed suicide after sustaining losses, and hundreds of families went bankrupt.
2912	Sihanouk, no gambler himself, was indifferent to the chaos he had caused, and his own expenditures continued to mount.
2913	A climax of sorts occurred in November, when an international film festival, stage:managed by the prince, ended with one of his own films, “Twilight,  being awarded a solid:gold statue sculpted from ingots donated for the purpose by Cambodia’s national bank.
2914	When Sihanouk left the country for his annual holiday in January 1970, many people who remained behind interpreted his departure as a flight.
2915	THE COUP OF 1970 Over the next two months, Sisowath Sirik Matak and his colleagues struggled to put Cambodia’s house in order, shutting down the casino and privatizing the banks.
2916	Matak traveled secretly to Hanoi to see what could be done to remove Vietnamese troops from Cambodian soil.
2917	Documents signed by Sihanouk agreeing to the Vietnamese bases infuriated him.
2918	Deliveries of supplies to Vietnamese forces inside the country were halted, and the stage was set for a full:scale confrontation with Vietnam—a scenario Sihanouk had struggled to avoid for fifteen years.
2919	In early March, riots broke out in Phnom Penh against the embassies of North Vietnam and its surrogate in South Vietnam, the National Liberation Front.
2920	The riots got out of hand, and both buildings were badly damaged.
2921	From Paris, Sihanouk condemned the violence, although the riots had occurred with his permission.
2922	Conditions were ripening for the coup d’état that Matak had been considering for several months, and the timetable was accelerated because it was feared that Sihanouk might soon return.
2923	On the night of March 17, Matak and three army officers visited Lon Nol at his house, threatened him with a pistol, and made him sign a declaration supporting a vote against the prince scheduled for the following day in the National Assembly.
2924	When he signed the document, as if aware of the long:term consequences of his action, Lon Nol burst into tears.

2927	What followed was an anticlimax and in sharp contrast to the operatic style of Sihanouk’s politics.
2928	The National Assembly, as it was entitled to do, voted 86–3 to remove its confidence from the prince and to replace him as chief of state, pending elections, with the relatively colorless president of the assembly, Cheng Heng.
2929	Lon Nol remained prime minister with Matak as his assistant.
2930	The coup was popular among educated people in Phnom Penh and in the army, but rural Cambodians were totally unprepared for it.
2931	Many of the plotters wanted to declare Cambodia a republic but delayed doing so after pro:Sihanouk riots broke out in several provinces.
2932	Meanwhile, the prince, who learned of the coup while traveling home via Moscow, was in Beijing.
2933	His first thought was to seek political asylum in France, but after talks with Zhou Enlai and the Vietnamese premier, Pham Van Dong, he agreed to take command of a united front government allied to North Vietnam, whose Cambodian forces would consist largely of the Communists his army had been struggling to destroy only a month before.
2934	At the end of March the prince broadcast an appeal to his “brothers and sisters  (they were no longer his children, apparently) to take up arms against Lon Nol.
2935	Pro:Sihanouk riots broke out almost immediately in the eastern part of the country.
2936	Fueled by panic, arrogance, and racism, Cambodian army units massacred hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians near Phnom Penh on the dubious grounds that they were allied with the Communists.
2937	They were certainly easier to locate than the North Vietnamese armed forces and easier to kill, but the viciousness of the massacre, and Lon Nol’s failure to express regret, evaporated the goodwill the regime had earned overseas.
2938	For most Cambodians, moreover, the idea that Vietnamese forces should leave Cambodia was more popular than the coup itself.
2939	After Lon Nol gave the Vietnamese Communists forty:eight hours to leave the country—probably the most unrealistic command in modern Cambodian history—many Cambodians were enraged to learn that the Vietnamese had ignored him, and tens of thousands poured into the armed forces to drive the “invaders  from the country.
2940	Thousands were killed or wounded over the next few weeks, picked off by Vietnamese soldiers who had been in combat in some cases for over twenty years.
2941	In May 1970, a joint US – South Vietnamese invasion of eastern Cambodia drove the North Vietnamese forces farther west.
2942	The invasion protected the US  withdrawal from Vietnam, but it probably spelled the end of Cambodia as a sovereign state.
2943	12 THE KHMER REPUBLIC’S SLOW COLLAPSE Lon Nol’s two offensives against the Vietnamese in late 1970 and 1971 were named after the pre:Angkorean kingdom of Chenla.
2944	They were encouraged by the United States, but Lon Nol’s troops were badly trained, poorly equipped, and often badly led.
2945	Experienced North Vietnamese forces cut them to pieces, and after 1971 Lon Nol’s troops mounted no major offensive actions.
2946	After becoming a republic in October 1970, the government survived for four more years, largely because of US  military and economic assistance and heavy bombing.
2947	The last four years of the Khmer Republic were violent and melancholy.
2948	Lon Nol suffered a stroke in early 1971  Although he recovered rapidly, he never regained full political control.
2949	Without strong leadership many politicians in Phnom Penh busied themselves with forming factions and amassing wealth.
2950	A leading actor was Lon Nol’s younger brother, Lon Non, whose efforts were concentrated on keeping Sisowath Sirik Matak—or anyone else—from gaining power from Lon Nol.
2951	In the countryside, republican army officers often falsified the numbers of soldiers under their command so as to pocket the salaries provided by the United States.
2952	Some officers also sold military equipment to the Communists:: few were prepared to take offensive action.
2953	Lon Nol was reluctant to punish the malfeasance or corruption of officers who were loyal to him.
2954	Instead, he spent much of his time writing long letters to his friend, President Nixon, pleading for US  aid while listening to Buddhist mystics who promised magical solutions to the war  By the end of 1972 the Khmer Republic controlled Phnom Penh, a few provincial capitals, and much of Battambang.
2955	The rest of the country was either in Communist hands or unsafe for anyone to administer  In the first half of 1973 the United States brutally postponed a Communist victory by conducting a bombing campaign on Cambodia that, in its intensity, was as far:reaching as any during World War II  Over a hundred thousand tons of bombs fell on the Cambodian countryside before the US  Congress prohibited further bombing.
2956	No reliable estimate of casualties has ever been made, but the campaign probably halted the Communist forces encircling Phnom Penh, even though some have argued that it hardened the will of the surviving Communist forces.
2957	The war dragged on for another year and a half, but President Nixon’s reaction to the end of the bombing was to declare to an aide that, as a result, the United States had “lost  Southeast Asia—a section of the world it had never owned.
2958	13 The Communists’ response to over twenty years of Vietnamese assistance to their movement was to massacre most of the Cambodians sent down from North Vietnam as soon as North Vietnamese troops withdrew from Cambodia at the end of 1972, following the cease:fire agreed upon by Vietnam and the United States.
2959	These killings occurred in secret.
2960	The Communists also experimented with programs of collectivization in the zones under their control, and in early 1973, during the US  bombing campaign, the CPK introduced compulsory cooperatives in some areas.
2961	By then, rumors were reaching Phnom Penh about the uncompromising conduct of the insurgents, who took no prisoners and who herded inhabitants into the forest whenever they captured a town or village.
2962	Many people in Phnom Penh dismissed these rumors as propaganda and continued to believe that the Khmer Rouge were puppets of the Vietnamese.
2963	At the same time they were exhausted by the war and ready for almost any alternative to the corrupt and inefficient Khmer Republic.
2964	Young girls in revolutionary costume, 1972  Photo by Serge Thion.
2965	The end came in early 1975 when the Communists mined the riverine approaches to Phnom Penh and thus prevented shipments of rice and ammunition from reaching the capital.
2966	Airlifts arranged by the United States were unable to bring in enough rice to feed Phnom Penh or enough ammunition to defend it.
2967	For the next three months the Cambodian Communists tightened their noose around the city, now swollen with perhaps two million refugees.
2968	In early March, Lon Nol flew out of the country taking along a million dollars awarded him by his government.
2969	Last:minute attempts to negotiate with Sihanouk, set in motion by the United States, came to nothing.
2970	At this point or shortly beforehand, and without waiting for approval from his Vietnamese allies, Saloth Sar and his colleagues decided to take Phnom Penh.
2971	On the morning of April 17, 1975, columns of Communist troops dressed in peasant clothes or simple khaki uniforms, ominously silent and heavily armed, converged on Phnom Penh from three directions.
2972	Many of them were under fifteen years of age.
2973	Walking slowly down the capital’s broad avenues, emptied of other traffic, they responded coldly to the people’s welcome.
2974	Their arrival coincided roughly with the Cambodian new year and came two weeks before the Communist victory in South Vietnam.
2975	The coincidences were deliberate, for the Communists probably intended that the year to come, like year one of the French Revolution, would usher in an entirely new phase of Cambodian history, without any connections to the revolution in Vietnam.
2976	14 12 REVOLUTION IN CAMBODIA It is uncertain whether historians of Cambodia a hundred years from now will devote as much space to the country’s brief revolutionary period as to the much longer, more complex, and more mysterious Angkorean era.
2977	For nearly all mature Cambodians in the early twenty:first century, however, the three years, eight months, and twenty days that followed the capture of Phnom Penh in April 1975 were a traumatic and unforgettable period.
2978	Because of the ferocity with which Cambodia’s revolution was waged, however, and the way it contrasted with many people’s ideas about pre: 1970 Cambodia, a chapter:length discussion of the period fits well in a narrative history of this kind.
2979	The Communist regime that controlled Cambodia between April 17, 1975, and January 7, 1979, was known as Democratic Kampuchea (DK).
2980	Survivors remember the time as vinh chu chot (three words for the sharp tastes of unripe fruit).
2981	The bitter:tasting revolution that DK sponsored swept through the country like a forest fire or a typhoon, and its spokesmen claimed after the military victory that “over two thousand years of Cambodia history  had ended.
2982	So had money, markets, formal education, Buddhism, books, private property, diverse clothing styles, and freedom of movement.
2983	No Cambodian government had ever tried to change so many things so rapidly:: none had been so relentlessly oriented toward the future or so biased in favor of the poor  The leaders of DK, who were members of Cambodia’s Communist Party (CPK) were for the most part hidden from view and called themselves the “revolutionary organization  (angkar padevat).
2984	They sought to transform Cambodia by replacing what they saw as impediments to national autonomy and social justice with revolutionary energy and incentives.
2985	They believed that family life, individualism, and an ingrained fondness for what they called feudal institutions, as well as the institutions themselves, stood in the way of the revolution.
2986	Cambodia’s poor, they said, had always been exploited and enslaved.
2987	Liberated by the revolution and empowered by military victory, these men and women would now become the masters of their lives and, collectively, the masters of their country.
2988	The CPK monitored every step of the revolution but concealed its existence from outsiders and did not reveal its socialist agenda or the names of its leaders.
2989	It said nothing of its long:standing alliance with the Communists in Vietnam and very little about the patronage of China and North Korea that the regime enjoyed.
2990	For several months the CPK’s leaders even allowed foreigners to think that Sihanouk, who had served as a figurehead leader for the anti–Lon Nol resistance, was still Cambodia’s chief of state.
2991	By concealing its alliances and agendas, the new government gave the impression that Cambodia and its revolution were genuinely independent.
2992	In 1978 Saloth Sar (Pol Pot) boasted to Yugoslavian visitors that Cambodia was “building socialism without a model.
2993	That process began in April 1975 and continued for the lifetime of DK, but by acknowledging that there were no precedents for what they were doing, Pol Pot and his colleagues had embarked on a perilous course.
2994	1 To transform the country thoroughly and at once, Communist cadres ordered everyone out of the cities and towns.
2995	In the week after April 17, 1975, over two million Cambodians were pushed into the countryside toward an uncertain fate.
2996	Only the families of top CPK officials and a few hundred Khmer Rouge soldiers were allowed to stay behind.
2997	This brutal order, never thoroughly explained, added several thousand deaths to what may have been five hundred thousand inflicted by the civil war  Reports reaching the West spoke of hospital patients driven from their beds, random executions, and sick and elderly people as well as small children dead or abandoned along the roads.
2998	The evacuation shocked its victims as well as observers in other countries, who had hoped that the new regime would try to govern through reconciliation.
2999	But these men and women may have forgotten the ferocity with which the civil war had been fought by both sides.
3000	Still other observers, more sympathetic to the idea of revolution, saw the evacuation of the cities as the only way Cambodia could grow enough food to survive, break down entrenched and supposedly backward:looking social hierarchies, loyalties, and arrangements and set its Utopian strategies in motion.
3001	2 The decision to evacuate the cities was made by the CPK’s leaders shortly before the liberation of Phnom Penh, but it was a closely kept secret and took some Communist commanders by surprise.
3002	One reason for the decision was that the capital was genuinely short of food.
3003	Another was the difficulty of administering several million people who had failed to support the revolution.
3004	A third was that the CPK’s leaders were fearful for their own security.
3005	Perhaps the overriding reason, however, was the desire to assert the victory of the CPK, the dominance of the countryside over the cities and the empowerment of the poor  Saloth Sar and his colleagues had not spent seven years in the forest and five years after that fighting a civil war to take office as city councilors.
3006	They saw the cities as breeding grounds for counterrevolution.
3007	Their economic priorities were based on the transformation of Cambodian agriculture, especially on increasing the national production of rice.
3008	By exporting the surplus, it was hoped that the government would earn hard currency with which to pay for imports and, eventually, to finance industrialization.
3009	To achieve such a surplus, the CPK needed all the agricultural workers it could find.
3010	For the next six months, the people who had been driven out of the cities—known to the regime as “new people  or “April 17 people —busied themselves with growing rice and other crops under the supervision of soldiers and CPK cadres.
3011	Conditions were severe, particularly for those unaccustomed to physical labor, but because in most districts there was enough to eat, many survivors of DK who had been evacuated from Phnom Penh came to look back on these months as a comparative golden age.
3012	For the first time in many years, Cambodia was not at war, and many so:called new people were eager to help to reconstruct their battered country.
3013	Perhaps, after all, Cambodia’s problems were indeed so severe as to require revolutionary solutions.
3014	A former engineer has said, “At first, the ideas of the revolution were good.
3015	He added, however, that “they didn’t work in practice.
3016	3 For many rural Cambodians, and especially those between fifteen and twenty:five, fighting against feudalism and the Americans in the early 1970s had provided beguiling glimpses of freedom, self:respect, and power —as well as access to weapons—that were unimaginable to their parents or to most Cambodians.
3017	These young people, to borrow a phrase from Mao Zedong, were “poor and blank  pages on which it was often easy to inscribe the teachings of the revolution.
3018	Owing everything to the revolutionary organization, which they referred to as their mother and father, and nothing to the past, it was thought that these young people would lead the way in transforming Cambodia into a socialist state and in moving the people toward independence, mastery, and self:reliance.
3019	To the alarm and confusion of many older people, these often violent young Cambodians became the revolution’s cutting edge.
3020	DK TAKES POWER, 1975–76 The DK period in Cambodia was characterized by regional and temporal variations.
3021	By and large, those parts of the country that had been under CPK control the longest tended to be the best equipped to deal with the programs set out by the party and the most accommodating to the new people.
3022	Cadres were better trained and more disciplined in the east, northeast, and southwest than they were in the northwest.
3023	Unfortunately for the new people, the northwest, centered on the provinces of Battambang and Pursat, had been the most productive agricultural area in prerevolutionary times.
3024	For this reason hundreds of thousands of new people were driven into the northwest in early 1976  The regime’s demands for crop surpluses were heavier there than in other regions, and so were the sufferings that ensued.
3025	4 The CPK divided Cambodia into seven zones (phumipheak), which in turn were broken down into thirty:two administrative regions (dombon).
3026	In general, conditions were relatively tolerable through 1976 in the northeastern and eastern zones, somewhat worse in the southwest, central, and west, and worst of all in the northern and northwestern zones.
3027	Within the zones there was also considerable variation, reflecting differences in leadership, resources, and external factors such as the fighting with Vietnam that broke out in earnest in the east and the southwest in the middle of 1977 5 Zones and administrative divisions of Democratic Kampuchea.
3028	Life was hard everywhere.
3029	On a national scale it is estimated that over the lifetime of the regime nearly two million people—or one person in four —died as a result of DK policies and actions.
3030	These included overworking people, neglecting or mistreating the sick, and giving everyone less food than they needed to survive.
3031	Perhaps as many as four hundred thousand were killed outright as enemies of the revolution.
3032	Most of these people died in provincial prison.
3033	On a per capita basis, and considering the short life span of DK, the number of regime:related deaths in Cambodia is one of the highest in recorded world history.
3034	Whether or not the death toll fits the terms of the UN genocide convention has been vigorously debated.
3035	Those who argue for the use of the term see close parallels in the Cambodian case to what happened during the Holocaust, in Armenia, and in Rwanda.
3036	Those arguing against the term suggest that racist motives were much lower on DK’s agenda (except for the systematic execution of Vietnamese residents in 1978 and, in some cases, Muslim Cham) than was destroying the regime’s political enemies, a category of victims purposely omitted from the UN genocide convention.
3037	For these critics the term crimes against humanity fits what happened in DK better than the highly charged and perhaps misleading genocide.
3038	6 The DK period can be divided into four phases.
3039	The first lasted from the capture of Phnom Penh until the beginning of 1976 when DK formally came into existence, a constitution was proclaimed, and a new wave of migration was set in motion from the center and southwest, which were heavily populated but relatively unproductive, to the rich ricegrowing areas in the northwest.
3040	The southwest had been liberated early and contained many revolutionary bases.
3041	It was crowded with refugees from Phnom Penh.
3042	Most of the northwest on the other hand had remained under republican control until April 1975  The regime counted on this area to lead the way in expanding Cambodia’s rice production, and the new people were the instruments chosen to achieve this goal.
3043	The fact that they were socially unredeemable was seen as an advantage because their deaths made no difference to the regime.
3044	In a chilling adage recalled by many survivors, they were often told, “Keeping you is no profit:: losing you is no loss.
3045	7 During this period, Phnom Penh radio enjoined its listeners via anonymous speakers and revolutionary songs to “build and defend Cambodia against unnamed enemies (khmang) and traitors (kbot cheat) outside and within the country in patterns reminiscent of Maoist China.
3046	In view of the regime’s collapse in 1979, there was a poignant optimism built into these pronouncements, but in the early stages of the revolution many Cambodians seem to have believed that it would succeed.
3047	Moreover, from the perspective of the party’s leaders, genuine or imagined enemies had not yet surfaced.
3048	DK’s second phase lasted until the end of September 1976 and marked the apogee of the regime, although conditions in most of the countryside deteriorated as the year progressed.
3049	It is uncertain why the leaders of the CPK waited so long to come into the open.
3050	They had managed to control the population without identifying themselves for nearly a year and a half.
3051	Perhaps this anonymity made them feel secure.
3052	China’s continuing patronage of Sihanouk might also have been a factor in the CPK’s postponing of its outright assumption of power  When the Chinese prime minister, Zhou Enlai, who was Prince Sihanouk’s most important patron, died in January 1976, the leaders of the CPK were ready to brush the prince aside and to force him to retire as chief of state.
3053	A confidential party document of March 1976 stated that “Sihanouk has run out of breath.
3054	He cannot go forward.
3055	Therefore we have decided to retire him.
3056	8 Sihanouk resigned three days later  In reports broadcast over Phnom Penh radio probably for foreign consumption, he was offered a pension that was never paid and a monument in his honor that was never erected.
3057	By April 1976 he was living under guard in a villa on the grounds of the royal palace with his wife and their son, Sihamoni, who became king of Cambodia when Sihanouk retired in 2004  The prince stayed there, in relative comfort but in fear of his life, until he was sent by DK on a diplomatic mission to the UN in January 1979  The March 1976 DK document also noted that the new government “must be purely a party organization  and stated that “Comrade Pol,  a pseudonym for Saloth Sar who was not otherwise identified, would be prime minister  The constitution of Democratic Kampuchea, promulgated in January 1976, guaranteed no human rights, defined few organs of government and, in effect, abolished private property, organized religion, and familyoriented agricultural production.
3058	The document acknowledged no foreign models, denied any foreign alliances or assistance, and said nothing about the CPK or Marxist:Leninist ideas.
3059	Instead, it made the revolution sound like a uniquely Cambodian affair with no connection to the outside world.
3060	9 When National Assembly elections were held in March, the CPK’s candidates were voted in unopposed.
3061	They included members of the CPK Central Committee, elected as peasants, rubber workers, and so on, as well as others harder to identify.
3062	Pol Pot, not otherwise identified, represented “rubber workers in the eastern zone.
3063	The candidates had no territorial constituencies, being seen instead as representatives of certain classes of Khmer  New people were not nominated or eligible to vote, and it seems that in much of the country no elections ever took place.
3064	The assembly met only once, to approve the constitution, and never played a significant role in DK  Like the elections themselves, the assembly seems to have been formed to placate foreign opinion.
3065	The people who achieved a prominent place in the new government were a mixture of intellectuals who had studied in France, including Pol Pot, Ieng Sary, Sary’s wife, Ieng Thirith, Hu Nim, Khieu Samphan, Thiounn Thioenn and Son Sen:: older members of the Indochinese Communist Party like Nuon Chea, Nhek Ros, Chou Chet, Non Suon, Ta Mok, and Sao Phim:: and younger militants who had never left Cambodia, such as Von Vet, Khek Pen, and Chhim Samauk.
3066	Those in charge of the zones did not include any ex:students from France:: they were concentrated in the newly established ministries of Phnom Penh.
3067	THE FOUR:YEAR PLAN Over the next few months, Pol Pot and his colleagues drafted a four:year economic plan “to build socialism in all fields.
3068	The plan was to go into effect in September 1976, but it was never formally launched.
3069	It called for the collectivization of all Cambodian property and proposed everincreasing levels of rice production throughout the country, with the aim of achieving an average national yield of three metric tons per hectare (1 4 tons per acre).
3070	The prerevolutionary national average, harvested under less stringent conditions and with monetary incentives, had been less than a ton per hectare, one of the lowest yields in Southeast Asia.
3071	The goal of tripling the average was to be achieved by extensive irrigation, double and triple cropping, longer working hours, and the release of revolutionary fervor supposedly derived from the people’s liberation from exploitation and individual concerns.
3072	The plan was hastily written.
3073	No effort was made to see if its proposals were appropriate to soil and water conditions in particular areas or if the infrastructure with which to achieve its goals was in place.
3074	Instead, the plan called for an “all out, storming offensive  by everyone throughout the country.
3075	Some writers have drawn parallels between the CPK’s program and the so:called war communism of the Soviet Union in the early 1920s:: others compare DK’s policies to those known as the Great Leap Forward in China in the 1950s.
3076	No material incentives were offered the Cambodian people in the plan except the bizarre promise that everyone would enjoy dessert on a daily basis—by 1980! Cambodia’s newfound independence, the empowerment of the poor, and the end of exploitation were thought to be sufficient incentives and rewards.
3077	10 Under the plan, crops such as cotton, jute, rubber, coconuts, sugar, and kapok were also to be cultivated for export.
3078	With the money earned from exports, light industry was to be established and, eventually, heavy industry as well.
3079	Plans for the latter were particularly Utopian, for they were dependent on raw materials like iron, steel, and petroleum, which did not exist in DK  Cambodia’s extensive offshore petroleum deposits were not discovered until the 1990s.
3080	In explaining the plan to high:ranking members of the party, an unnamed spokesman, presumably Pol Pot, stated that it could be accomplished swiftly.
3081	The DK revolution, after all, was “a new experience, and an important one for the whole world, because we don’t perform like others.
3082	We leap [directly to] a socialist revolution, and swiftly build socialism.
3083	We don’t need a long period of time for transformation.
3084	11 The plan said nothing about leisure, religion, formal education, or family life.
3085	Although it was deemed crucial to “abolish illiteracy among the population,  nothing was said about what people would be given or allowed to read.
3086	Some primary schools existed in base areas by 1976, but education was not extended to new people or their children until 1977 or 1978  Education above the primary level did not exist before 1978, when a belated attempt was made to establish a technical high school in Phnom Penh.
3087	In part, DK officials were making a virtue of necessity, since most men and women known to be experienced schoolteachers and hostile to the CPK were suspected of treasonous intentions and were often killed as class enemies.
3088	Former teachers who were members of the party, like Pol Pot and Ieng Sary, now had more rewarding tasks to perform.
3089	Most Cambodians under DK had to work ten to twelve hours a day, twelve months a year to accomplish the objectives of the plan.
3090	Many of those who were unaccustomed to physical labor soon died of malnutrition and overwork, but even those who had been farmers in prerevolutionary times found themselves working longer and harder than they had before 1975, with no material rewards, limited access to their spouses and children, and very little free time.
3091	By early 1976, food was already scarce, since the surpluses from the first harvests had been gathered up to feed the army, to be stored, or to be exported.
3092	The situation deteriorated in 1977 and 1978 when much of the country was stricken with famine.
3093	Many survivors recall months of eating rice gruel without much else.
3094	One of them, now living in Australia, has said, “We looked like the Africans you see on television.
3095	Our legs were like sticks:: we could barely walk.
3096	12 A similar famine had swept through China in the early 1960s in the wake of the Great Leap Forward.
3097	In Cambodia, news of the famine was slow to reach the leaders in Phnom Penh:: when it did, starvation was seen as evidence of mismanagement and treachery by those cadres charged with distribution of food.
3098	These people, many of them loyal members of the CPK, were soon arrested, interrogated, and put to death.
3099	The DK’s leaders seem to have believed that the forces they had mobilized to defeat the Americans—two weeks earlier than a similar victory had taken place in Vietnam—were sufficient for any task set by the “clear:sighted  CPK 13 During this second stage of the DK era, inexperienced cadres, in order to meet the targets imposed from the center, placed what were often unbearable pressures on the April 17 people and everyone else under their command.
3100	One way of achieving surpluses was to reduce the amount of rice used for seed and what had been set aside to feed the people.
3101	Rations were sufficient for survival, and in several parts of the country, people had enough to eat for most of 1976  In much of the northwest, however, rations diminished as the center’s Utopian priorities came into force.
3102	Several hundred thousand more “new people  had been brought into the area in early 1976, and many of them were set to work hacking clearings out of the jungle.
3103	No Western:style medicines were available, and thousands soon died from malaria, overwork, and malnutrition.
3104	A CRISIS IN THE PARTY In early September 1976, Mao Zedong died shortly before the CPK was to celebrate its twenty:fifth anniversary.
3105	Pol Pot used his comments on Mao’s death to state publicly for the first time that Cambodia was being governed in accordance with Marxist:Leninist ideas.
3106	He stopped short of identifying angkar padevat as the CPK  It seems likely that the CPK had hoped to use its anniversary on September 30 to announce its existence to the world and to launch its Four:Year Plan.
3107	As the month wore on, however, a split developed inside the CPK between those who favored the 1951 date for the foundation of the party and those who preferred 1960, when a special congress had convened in Phnom Penh and had named Pol Pot and Ieng Sary, among others, to the party’s Central Committee.
3108	To those who preferred the 1960 date, the earlier one was suggestive of Vietnamese domination of the party.
3109	They viewed those who favored 1951 as people whose primary loyalties were to Vietnam.
3110	What Pol Pot later described as the putting down of a potential coup d’état against his rule was more likely a preemptive purge of several party members whose loyalties to the party (or to Vietnam) seemed to be greater than their loyalties to Pol Pot.
3111	14 Two prominent members of the CPK, Keo Meas and Non Suon, who both had ties to the Vietnamese:dominated phase of the party’s history were arrested and accused of treason.
3112	Their confessions assert that they supported a 1951 founding date for the CPK 15 Overall, several thousand typed and handwritten confessions have survived from the DK interrogation center in the Phnom Penh suburb of Tuol Sleng, known in the DK period by its code name S:21  At least fourteen thousand men and women were questioned, tortured, and executed at the facility between the end of 1975 and the first few days of 1979, and over four thousand of their dossiers survive.
3113	Some of these run to hundreds of pages.
3114	The confessions are invaluable for historians, but it is impossible to tell from these documents alone whether or not a genuine conspiracy to dethrone Pol Pot and his associates had gathered momentum by September 1976  Like Sihanouk and Lon Nol, Pol Pot considered disagreements over policy to be tantamount to treason, and arguments over the party’s founding date suggested to him that certain people wanted him removed from power 16 At the end of the month, barely four days before the anniversary of the party was to be celebrated, Pol Pot resigned as prime minister “for reasons of health  and was replaced by the second:ranking man in the CPK, Nuon Chea.
3115	Pol Pot’s health had often broken down in the preceding year and a half, but he probably announced his resignation at this point to throw his enemies off balance and to draw others into the open.
3116	The resignation, in fact, may never have actually taken place.
3117	By mid:October, in any case, he was back in office.
3118	In November, after the arrest of the Gang of Four, Pol Pot and five of his colleagues traveled secretly to China to reassure themselves of continuing Chinese support.
3119	By 1978 this included two Chinese engineering regiments engaged in building a military airfield near Kompong Chhnang.
3120	It is likely that this ongoing military help was agreed upon at this time.
3121	17 There was still no announcement of the party’s existence, however, as its leaders had decided to keep the matter secret for the time being, to postpone a formal announcement of the Four:Year Plan and to intensify the search for enemies inside the party.
3122	In the meantime, S:21 expanded its operations.
3123	Only two hundred prisoners entered the facility in 1975, but more than ten times that many (2,250) were brought there in 1976, and more than two:thirds of them were imprisoned between September and November, covering the period of unease in the CPK discussed above.
3124	Another five thousand prisoners were taken there in 1977, and approximately the same number were imprisoned in 1978  Factory workers in Phnom Penh, who knew about the center’s existence but not about what went on inside its barbed:wire walls, called it a“place of entering, no leaving  (konlanh choul ot cenh).
3125	Only a dozen of the prisoners taken there for interrogation avoided being put to death.
3126	18 In December 1976, as the purges intensified, Pol Pot presided over a “study session  restricted to high:ranking members of the party that was called to examine the progress of the Cambodian revolution.
3127	The document that has survived from this meeting, a speech by Pol Pot, is darker and more pessimistic than those produced earlier in the year  In a vivid passage, Pol Pot spoke of a “sickness in the party  that had developed during 1976: Democratic Kampuchean cadre, Thai:Cambodian border, 1979  Photo by Brian L  Stevens.
3128	We cannot locate it precisely.
3129	The illness must emerge to be examined.
3130	Because the heat of [previous stages of the revolution] was insufficient at the level of people’s struggle and class struggle --- we searched for the microbes within the party without success.
3131	They are buried.
3132	As our socialist revolution advances, however, seeping more strongly into every corner of the party, the army and among the people, we can locate the evil microbes--- Those who defend us must be truly adept.
3133	They should have practice in observing.
3134	They must observe everything, but not so that those being observed are aware of it.
3135	19 Who were the observers and who were the observed? People opposed to the revolution were moving targets depending on the evolving policies and priorities of the party’s leadership.
3136	At different stages of DK’s short history, the “evil microbes  were those with middle:class backgrounds or soldiers who had fought for Lon Nol, those who had joined the Communist movement when it was guided by Vietnam, or those who had been exposed to foreign countries.
3137	In 1977, attention shifted to the northern and northwestern zones where famines had occurred, and by 1978 victims included high:ranking members of the party, military commanders, and officials associated with the eastern zone.
3138	To be suspected, a person had only to be mentioned in the confessions of three other people.
3139	Those accused would name the people they knew, and so on.
3140	Hundreds, probably thousands of those who were taken to S:21 were completely innocent of the charges brought against them, but everyone who was interrogated was considered guilty, and nearly all those who were interrogated were killed.
3141	News of people’s disappearances was used to keep their colleagues in the party in line, but the deaths themselves and the existence of the prison were not made public.
3142	The regime never expressed regret for anyone it had executed by mistake.
3143	For Pol Pot and his colleagues, too much hung in the balance for them to hesitate in attacking enemies of the party: the success of the revolution, the execution of policy, and the survival of the leaders themselves.
3144	At the end of his December 1976 speech, Pol Pot remarked that such enemies “have been entering the party continuously--- They remain—perhaps only one person, or two people.
3145	They remain.
3146	20 The effect of brutal, ambiguous threats like these on the people listening to them is impossible to gauge.
3147	Within a year many of these men and women had been arrested, interrogated, tortured, and put to death at S:21  In most cases, they were forced to admit that they had joined the “CIA  (a blanket term for counterrevolutionary activity) early in their careers.
3148	Others claimed to have worked for Soviet or Vietnamese intelligence agencies.
3149	It is unclear whether Pol Pot and the cadres at S:21 who forced people to make these confessions believed in these conspiracies or merely in the efficacy of executing anyone who was suspected by those in power 21 CONFLICT WITH VIETNAM The third phase of the DK era, between the political crisis of September 1976 and a speech by Pol Pot twelve months later in which he announced the existence of the CPK, was marked by waves of purges and by a shift toward blaming Cambodia’s difficulties and counterrevolutionary activity to an increasing extent on Vietnam.
3150	Open conflict with Vietnam had been a possibility ever since April 1975, when Cambodian forces had attacked several Vietnamese:held islands in the Gulf of Thailand with the hope of making territorial gains in the final stages of the Vietnam War  The Cambodian forces had been driven back and differences between the two Communist regimes had more or less been papered over, but DK’s distrust of Vietnamese territorial intentions was very deep.
3151	So were Pol Pot’s suspicions of the Vietnamese Communist Party, whose leaders had been patronizing toward their Cambodian counterparts for many years and had allowed Cambodia’s armed struggle to flourish only in the shadow of Vietnam’s.
3152	Pol Pot’s suspicions deepened in July 1977 when Vietnam signed a treaty of cooperation with Laos, a move that he interpreted as part of Vietnam’s plan to encircle Cambodia and to reconstitute and control what had once been French Indochina.
3153	22 Realizing the relative strengths of the two countries, however, Pol Pot tried at first to maintain correct relations and was unwilling to expand DK’s armed forces to defend eastern Cambodia against possible Vietnamese incursions.
3154	The Vietnamese, recovering from almost thirty years of fighting, were also cautious.
3155	In 1975–76, however, their attempts to open negotiations about the frontier were rebuffed by the Cambodians, who demanded that the Vietnamese honor the verbal agreements they had reached with Sihanouk in the 1960s.
3156	Cambodians claimed parts of the Gulf of Thailand, where they hoped to profit from partially explored but unexploited offshore oil deposits, but these claims were rejected by the Vietnamese, who had similar hopes.
3157	Skirmishes along the border between heavily armed, poorly disciplined troops in 1976 led Vietnamese and Cambodian leaders to doubt each other’s sincerity.
3158	The Cambodian raids were much more brutal, but the evidence for centralized control or approval for attacks on either side before the middle of 1977 is contradictory.
3159	23 The situation was complicated further by the fact that Pol Pot and his colleagues believed the Cambodian minorities in southern Vietnam were ready to overthrow Vietnamese rule:: they wanted to attach these minorities to DK  Sihanouk and Lon Nol had also dreamt of a greater Cambodia.
3160	In fact, whatever the views of the Khmer in Vietnam might have been, they were insufficiently armed, motivated, and organized to revolt.
3161	When no uprising occurred, Pol Pot suspected treachery on the part of the agents he had dispatched to foment it.
3162	His troops were also merciless:: on their crossborder raids that began in April 1977, they encountered and massacred hapless Khmer who had unwittingly failed to follow his scenario.
3163	As so often in modern Cambodian history, what Cambodians interpreted as an internal affair or a quarrel between neighbors had unforeseen international repercussions.
3164	For several months after the death of Mao Zedong and the arrest of his radical subordinates known as the Gang of Four, the Chinese regime was in disarray.
3165	Although the four radicals were soon arrested, the new ruler, Hua Guofeng, tried to maintain Mao’s momentum by opposing the Soviet Union, praising Mao’s ideas and supporting third world revolutions like DK’s.
3166	Many Chinese officials, including Hua’s successor, Deng Xiaoping, perceived Vietnam as a pro: Soviet threat along their southern border—much as the United States at the time saw Cuba.
3167	For the Chinese, Cambodia was a convenient and conveniently radical ally.
3168	By early 1977, large quantities of arms, ammunition, and military equipment were coming into DK from China.
3169	Ironically, the Chinese were asking DK to play a role that mirrored the one played by the regime DK had overthrown, when the Khmer Republic had been “groomed  to serve the interests of the United States.
3170	24 This phase of the DK era ended in late September 1977 when Pol Pot, in a five:hour speech recorded for Phnom Penh radio, announced the existence of the CPK on the occasion of the seventeenth anniversary of its foundation.
3171	25 The speech failed to explain why the party’s existence had been kept a secret for so long, and the announcement may have responded to pressure from China in exchange for that country’s continuing military assistance.
3172	In any case, the day after the speech was broadcast Pol Pot flew to Beijing where he was feted publicly by Hua Guofeng, whom he had met in secret a year before.
3173	The Chinese offered extensive help to DK in its confrontation with Vietnam.
3174	More realistic than DK’s leaders, they did not support a full:scale war, knowing that Cambodia would lose, until they were pushed by Pol Pot and Vietnamese intransigence toward that position in 1978 26 Pol Pot’s long speech contained some veiled warnings to Vietnam, but its main intention was to review the long trajectory of Cambodian history, culminating in the triumph of the CPK  The format was chronological, divided into a discussion of events before 1960, between 1960 and 1975, and developments in DK itself.
3175	The 1960 congress, he asserted, marked the establishment of a “correct line  for the CPK, but since armed struggle was postponed for eight more years and the party’s leaders had to flee Phnom Penh in 1963, he found few benefits to mention that flowed from the party’s line in terms of revolutionary practice.
3176	Benefits flowed after the anti:Sihanouk coup, to be sure, but Pol Pot failed to mention the most significant of them, Vietnamese military assistance to the Khmer Rouge.
3177	Similarly, Sihanouk himself was never mentioned.
3178	In closing, Pol Pot noted that “with complete confidence, we rely on the powerful revolutionary spirit, experience, and creative ingenuity of our people,  failing also to mention Chinese military aid.
3179	Optimistically, he predicted that Cambodia would soon have twenty million people (“Our aim is to increase the population as quickly as possible ) and claimed that the average food intake had reached over three hundred kilograms (660 pounds) of rice per person per year  Many refugees later took issue with the latter statement, pointing out that by the middle of 1977 in much of the country and for the first time in Cambodian history, rice had virtually disappeared from the diet.
3180	It is likely that Pol Pot had been encouraged to make the speech and to bring the CPK into the open by his Chinese allies and that, because of the importance of that alliance, he was happy to oblige.
3181	In late September 1977 Pol Pot embarked on a state visit to China.
3182	At the Beijing airport, the DK delegation was met by China’s premier, Hua Guofeng, and Deng Xiaoping, who was to replace Hua in 1978  The visit probably marked the high point (for Pol Pot at least) of the DK regime.
3183	The warmth of the welcome that the Cambodians received probably convinced him that the Chinese would support DK if and when hostilities broke out between Cambodia and Vietnam.
3184	In fact, while the Chinese encouraged DK’s hostility toward Vietnam, they also hoped for a peaceful solution.
3185	27 DK CLOSES DOWN Vietnam saw the DK:Beijing alliance that was strengthened during Pol Pot’s visit to China as a provocation, and in mid:December 1977 Vietnam mounted a military offensive against Cambodia.
3186	Fourteen divisions were involved, and Vietnamese troops penetrated up to thirty:two kilometers (twenty miles) into Cambodia in some areas.
3187	In the first week of 1978, after DK had broken off diplomatic relations with Vietnam, most of the Vietnamese troops went home, taking along thousands of Cambodian villagers as hostages.
3188	The Vietnamese soon began grooming some of these hostages as a government in exile:: others were given military training.
3189	One of the exiles, a DK regimental commander named Hun Sen, who had fled Cambodia in 1977, emerged as the premier of the People’s Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) in 1985  Aside from the UN interregnum in 1992–93, he has remained in command of Cambodian politics ever since.
3190	Pol Pot’s response to the Vietnamese withdrawal was to claim a “total victory,  while secretly purging military officers and CPK cadres in the eastern zone where the Vietnamese penetration had been the deepest.
3191	These men and women were said to have Cambodian bodies and Vietnamese minds.
3192	Several hundred of them were executed at Tuol Sleng:: hundreds of others, on the spot.
3193	28 In the confusion many DK soldiers from the eastern zone sought refuge in Vietnam.
3194	One of them, Heng Samrin, later became the chief of state of the PRK and a revered, inconsequential figure in subsequent regimes.
3195	In addition, thousands of people in the east were forcibly transferred toward the west in early 1978  Local troops in the east were massacred and replaced by troops from the southwest.
3196	The man in charge of the eastern zone, an ICP veteran named Sao Phim, committed suicide in June 1978 when summoned to Phnom Penh for consultation.
3197	The massacres in the east continued for several months.
3198	29 In 1978 the DK regime tried to open itself to the outside world and to improve its image with the Cambodian people.
3199	Gestures included a general amnesty offered to the population and the establishment of a technical high school in Phnom Penh.
3200	The regime welcomed visits from sympathetic journalists and foreign radicals and inaugurated diplomatic relations with non:Communist countries such as Burma and Malaysia These actions had mixed results.
3201	For example, a Yugoslavian television crew visited DK in 1978, and the footage broadcast later in the year gave the outside world its first glimpse of life there and of Pol Pot.
3202	One of the cameramen later remarked that the only person the crew had seen smiling in Cambodia was Pol Pot.
3203	Other visitors who sympathized with DK praised everything they saw.
3204	They were taken to see places the regime was proud of, and what they saw fit their preconceptions.
3205	Most survivors of the regime, however, remember 1978 as the harshest year of DK, when communal dining halls were introduced in many areas and rations fell below the starvation levels of 1977  By this time also, Vietnamese attempts to reopen negotiations with DK had failed.
3206	Nearly a hundred thousand Vietnamese troops were massed along the Cambodian border by April 1978, just before Pol Pot’s suppression of enemies in the eastern zone.
3207	Vietnam also signed a twentyfive: year treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union to balance the threat from China and in early December announced that a Kampuchean Front for National Salvation had been set up in “liberated Cambodian territory to overthrow DK  The front included several leaders of later Khmer politics, such as Heng Samrin, Chea Sim, and Hun Sen.
3208	30 Vietnam and DK now embarked on a long and costly struggle that played into the hands of larger powers.
3209	These powers, in turn, were not prepared to take risks.
3210	There is evidence, for example, that Pol Pot requested that the Chinese provide volunteers but that the request was turned down.
3211	DK would have to face the Vietnamese (and serve Chinese interests) on its own.
3212	The parallels between the last days of DK and the last days of Lon Nol’s regime in 1975 are striking, and ironic.
3213	In December 1978 two American journalists and a Scottish Marxist academic, Malcolm Caldwell, visited Cambodia.
3214	The journalists, Elizabeth Becker and Richard Dudman, had worked in Cambodia in the early 1970s, and they were the first nonsocialist writers to visit DK  Recalling her visit several years later, Becker wrote: The Phnom Penh I first glimpsed had the precise beauty of a mausoleum--- There was no litter on the streets, no trash, no dirt.
3215	But then there were no people either, no bicycles or buses and very few automobiles.
3216	31 Caldwell, who had written sympathetically about the regime, was invited to Cambodia as a friend, but Becker and Dudman were thought by DK officials to be working for the CIA, and the movements of all three were closely monitored.
3217	On their last night in the country, December 22, Caldwell was killed in his hotel room by unknown assailants perhaps connected with an anti–Pol Pot faction eager to destabilize the regime.
3218	On Christmas Day 1978, Vietnamese forces numbering over one hundred thousand attacked DK on several fronts.
3219	Because DK forces were crowded into the eastern and southwestern zones, Vietnamese attacks in the northeast encountered little resistance, and by the end of the year several major roads to Phnom Penh were in Vietnamese hands.
3220	At this point the Vietnamese altered their strategy, which had been to occupy the eastern half of the country, and decided to capture the capital itself.
3221	The city, by then containing perhaps fifty thousand bureaucrats, soldiers, and factory workers, was abandoned on January 7, 1979  Up to the last, DK officials had confidently claimed victory.
3222	Pol Pot, like the US  ambassador in 1975, escaped at the last moment in a jeep:: other high officials and foreign diplomats left by train.
3223	They were followed later, on foot, by the half:starved, poorly equipped remnants of their armed forces.
3224	32 It was a humiliating end for the DK leaders and for their Utopian vision of Cambodia.
3225	The revolutionary organization never expressed regret for the appalling loss of life that had occurred since “liberation  in 1975  Even after DK’s demise, well into the 1990s, tens of thousands of Khmer, particularly young people, were still prepared to give their lives to the first organization that had given them power and self:respect.
3226	Some of these people formed the backbone of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla army in the 1980s.
3227	Moreover, once the purges had burnt themselves out, the leaders of the CPK (despite or perhaps because of the party’s official dissolution in 1981) remained in place and in command of the resistance throughout the 1980s and 1990s.
3228	33 Democratic Kampuchean killing ground near Phnom Penh, exhumed in 1979  Photo by Kelvin Rowley.
3229	Nearly everyone else welcomed the Vietnamese invasion and accepted the government that was swiftly put in place by the invaders as preferable to what had gone before.
3230	The new government called itself the People’s Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) and was staffed at its upper levels by former CPK members who had defected to Vietnam in 1977–78, as well as by some Khmer who had lived in Vietnam throughout the DK period.
3231	Most Cambodians rejoiced at the disappearance of a:Pot (“the contemptible Pot ), as they now called the deposed prime minister  For nearly everyone the DK era had been one of unmitigated suffering, violence, and confusion.
3232	With luck, in exile, or in the PRK, most Cambodians now thought they could resume their prerevolutionary lives, which DK had held in such contempt.
3233	34 13 CAMBODIA SINCE 1979 THE PRK: EARLY PHASES In early 1979 and for the first time since the 1950s, Cambodia was controlled by a foreign power  The situation was also reminiscent of the 1830s in that the power was Vietnam, but closer parallels existed with the final years of the French protectorate when the French took responsibility for Cambodia’s defense, internal security, and foreign affairs, leaving less crucial areas (from their point of view) in Cambodian hands.
3234	Almost immediately after capturing Phnom Penh, the Vietnamese helped their Cambodian protégés establish the People’s Republic of Kampuchea (PRK).
3235	Its leading officials were DK military officers who had defected to Vietnam in 1978, Cambodians who had lived in Vietnam since the 1950s, and members of ethnic minorities untainted by service to DK  Several figures in this original group—Heng Samrin, Chea Sim, and Hun Sen—remained powerful through the 1980s.
3236	Hun Sen, who became prime minister in 1985 (while retaining his foreign affairs portfolio), gradually assumed more and more power on his own.
3237	The new government promised to respect human rights, including freedom of opinion and association, but it was severe with its political opponents, as all earlier regimes had been.
3238	No elections were held until 1981, and those were not contested by opposing parties.
3239	Barely a month after declaring its existence, the PRK signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation with Vietnam.
3240	This gesture, combined with the hardships affecting all Cambodians, convinced many men and women that they might be better off outside the country.
3241	Vietnam’s occupation of Cambodia and its alliance with the Soviet Union angered the Chinese, who launched an attack on northern Vietnam in February 1979 with the tacit support of the United States.
3242	The campaign involved three hundred thousand Chinese troops and lasted for two weeks.
3243	Thousands of people were killed on both sides, and several Vietnamese cities along the border were laid waste.
3244	When the Chinese withdrew, supposedly Vietnamese policies toward Cambodia (and Chinese policies, for that matter) remained unchanged.
3245	The main effects of the attack were to encourage tens of thousands of Sino:Vietnamese to flee Vietnam and to strengthen the burgeoning US :Chinese alliance.
3246	Thailand’s similar alliance with China, encouraged by the United States, was beneficial to the DK military remnants filtering into Thailand and made the Vietnamese even more reluctant to withdraw from Cambodia.
3247	Like those of DK in 1978, Vietnam’s leaders believed themselves surrounded by enemies.
3248	1 At first nearly all Cambodians welcomed the Vietnamese, not because they preferred being invaded to being autonomous but because the invasion signaled the end of DK  Almost at once, nearly everyone began moving.
3249	Throughout 1979 and for most of 1980, hundreds of thousands of Cambodians crisscrossed the country looking for relatives, returning to their homes, trading, or seeking refuge overseas.
3250	Although Vietnamese forces pursued DK armed remnants into the northwest, civil authorities did nothing to prevent this less:organized movement of people or the informal revival of trade.
3251	As the PRK struggled to its feet, many prerevolutionary institutions, including markets, Buddhism, and family farming, came back to life.
3252	Buddhist wats and schools reopened soon afterward.
3253	The PRK’s laissez:faire policy, however, did not extend to political activity, which was monopolized by the government and the People’s Revolutionary Party of Kampuchea (PRPK), a Communist grouping that shared its pre:1975 history with the discredited CPK 2 Amid so much disorder, most of the 1979 rice crop went untended.
3254	By the middle of the year a famine had broken out.
3255	Very few Cambodians stayed put long enough to plant the 1979–80 rice crop, and when grain stored before 1979 had been consumed or appropriated by Vietnamese forces, hundreds of thousands of Khmer had little to eat.
3256	Famine conditions were exacerbated by a drought, and it was at this point that Cambodia gained attention in the West where television audiences, already vaguely aware of the horrors perpetrated in DK, were shocked to see skeletal Khmers stumbling into Thailand or dying of starvation beside Cambodia’s roads.
3257	The sufferings provoked a massive charitable response, but the delivery of food and medicine from abroad was often delayed by bureaucratic rivalries, by constraints imposed by Thailand and its allies, and to an extent by the Vietnamese themselves, who were understandably suspicious of Western motives and used some of the food and medicine to support their hard:pressed military and administrative personnel.
3258	3 Conditions stabilized in 1980 when the rice harvest doubled in size.
3259	In rural areas Vietnamese forces withdrew into garrisons, and local people were once again put in control of their own affairs.
3260	Rural society was a shambles.
3261	Villages had been abandoned or torn down:: tools, seed, and fertilizer were nonexistent:: hundreds of thousands of people had emigrated or been killed:: and in most areas the survivors suffered from malaria, shock, or malnutrition.
3262	So many men had died or disappeared in DK that in some districts more than 60 percent of the families were headed by widows.
3263	Thousands of widows raised their families alone and with difficulty.
3264	In response to these conditions, as well as to collectivist ideas, the PRK instituted “solidarity groups  (krom sammaki) composed of several families as collective units to cultivate the land.
3265	Private ownership was not recognized, but collectives and communes, despised in DK, were not reintroduced.
3266	At the district and provincial levels, PRK officials endeavored to exert centralized control but made no effort to collect taxes or to conscript young men for military service.
3267	Schools reopened throughout Cambodia in 1979, and currency was reintroduced in 1980.
3268	4 For most Cambodians the reappearance of a certain amount of personal freedom, and the PRK’s unrevolutionary caution, contrasted sharply with their experiences under DK  At the same time they knew that the PRK owed its existence to a foreign invasion and to Vietnamese and Soviet:bloc support.
3269	Many high:ranking officials and regional cadres had served happily enough in DK, and some educated Cambodians sensed an unwholesome continuity between the successive socialist regimes.
3270	PRK officials, moreover, refused to distance themselves from Marxism: Leninism or one:party rule.
3271	Instead, they preferred to demonize the “genocidal Pol Pot–Ieng Sary clique,  blaming the 1975–79 catastrophes on these two individuals rather than on the extreme but recognizably socialist policies of the CPK  The two villains were tried in absentia in Phnom Penh in August 1979  Valuable evidence about the DK period emerged at the trial, but in many respects it was a farce.
3272	No evidence was offered in Pol Pot’s or Ieng Sary’s defense, and the two men were condemned to death.
3273	Soon afterward, the DK interrogation center at Tuol Sleng was inaugurated by the Vietnamese as a genocidal museum.
3274	The use of the word genocide and comparisons of Pol Pot to Hitler suggested that as far as the PRK was concerned, DK had had a fascist rather than a Communist government.

3277	OPPOSITION TO THE PRK The PRK was unable to engender widespread trust among what remained of Cambodia’s educated elite.
3278	Most of these men and women were not prepared to entrust Cambodia to foreigners or to endure more socialism.
3279	In 1979–80 tens of thousands of them walked into exile in Thailand, eventually finding residence abroad or in the refugee camps that sprang up along the border  The loss of so many educated people, on top of the tens of thousands who had perished in DK, was a serious blow to the country, By the end of 1979 the refugee camps sheltered several anti: Vietnamese resistance factions.
3280	One of the largest of these, led by former Prime Minister Son Sann, sought foreign support to remove the Vietnamese occupation forces and to reimpose prerevolutionary institutions, except Sihanouk, whom Son Sann had come to distrust.
3281	This faction drew many supporters from Cambodians who had been living overseas and were nostalgic, and from recent arrivals at the border who were enraged by the destruction of the 1970s and by what they saw as open:ended Vietnamese control.
3282	Son Sann was unable to establish an effective military force, however, and obtained very little material support from Vietnam’s principal antagonists—China, Thailand, and the United States.
3283	In military terms these powers preferred DK  In the meantime, DK’s leadership in exile remained unchanged.
3284	The CPK continued its shadowy existence, and a DK delegation held onto Cambodia’s seat at the United Nations.
3285	China and the United States supported this state of affairs so as to punish Vietnam for invading Cambodia, standing up to China, and defeating the United States.
3286	They were joined by Singapore and Thailand, both of which pursued anti: Communist, pro:Chinese policies.
3287	Supporting DK was a small price for all of these powers to pay to keep their more important alliances intact.
3288	In 1979 and 1980 the Thai military government fed, clothed, and restored to health several thousand DK soldiers who had straggled across the border, and these soldiers also received arms, ammunition, and military supplies from China, ferried through Thai ports.
3289	By 1982 the DK remnants had become a relatively effective military force.
3290	Their dependents, who were treated as political refugees, were fed and housed by agencies of the United Nations.
3291	Because of the PRK’s pariah status, however, UN development agencies were prohibited from operating in Cambodia itself.
3292	6 In 1980 and 1981 more and more information emerged from Cambodia about the horrors of DK  Evidence from the Pol Pot–Ieng Sary trial was confirmed and amplified by refugee testimony, written memoirs, and confessions found in the archives at Tuol Sleng.
3293	The PRK inaugurated “days of hate  in 1982 that provided occasions for survivors of the DK era to tell their stories.
3294	DK spokesmen, for their part, admitted only a few mistakes and blamed the Vietnamese for executing over two million Khmer  Although PRK propaganda was often heavy:handed and inaccurate, even cautious estimates of DK:related deaths caused by overwork, starvation, mistreated diseases, and executions came close to two million Cambodians, or close to one in four then living.
3295	7 China and other powers, faced with the task of improving DK’s image while continuing to punish Vietnam, began pressuring Prince Sihanouk, who was living in exile in Beijing, to return to political life.
3296	The prince was willing to do so only on his own terms.
3297	He did not want to renew his alliance with DK, he feared the Vietnamese, and he knew that Son Sann’s faction opposed his coming back into power  At the same time, it was difficult for him to resist Chinese pressure and to remain inactive, for he still identified himself with the destiny of his country.
3298	Maneuvers to form a coalition involving Sihanouk, Son Sann, and the DK occupied much of 1981 and 1982, while the PRK and its Vietnamese advisers worked hard to improve their image overseas.
3299	In June 1981 a constitution modeled to a large extent on Vietnam’s was introduced in the PRK  The document granted a range of human rights to Cambodia’s people but enjoined them to carry out the “state’s political line.
3300	This document was followed by the establishment of several new ministries, the emergence from concealment of the PRPK, and elections for a National Assembly, which approved the constitution.
3301	The policies of the PRK fitted closely with Vietnamese priorities, although positions of responsibility, as the government expanded, increasingly fell to men and women without socialist credentials.
3302	Little by little the PRK became a responsive, functional government whose military, police, and foreign affairs were still subject to Vietnamese control.
3303	In this respect it resembled Cambodia in the closing years of the French protectorate.
3304	Over one hundred thousand Vietnamese troops remained on Cambodian soil.
3305	THE CGDK Developments in the PRK combined with DK’s squalid reputation added urgency to foreign efforts to form a coalition government consistent with the Cold War policies of outside powers.
3306	In early 1981 Sihanouk met with Khieu Samphan, representing DK, to discuss how such a coalition might be formed.
3307	Son Sann was reluctant to join the talks, but in September 1981 the three factions announced that they were prepared to act together  Soon afterward, the CPK’s Central Committee announced the dissolution of the party and that faction’s conversion to capitalist ideas.
3308	Ieng Thirith remarked that DK had changed completely and had, among other things, restored religious beliefs.
3309	Her husband, Ieng Sary, added that Cambodia would not be subjected to socialism for “many generations.
3310	The alleged dissolution of the CPK convinced no one, but enabled the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK) to claim it was a capitalist formation.
3311	All the CPK’s high officials, including Pol Pot and Ieng Sary, remained in place in the CGDK, and no non:Communists were given responsible positions.
3312	Despite their conversion to free market economics, DK:controlled camps remained much stricter than those controlled by other factions.
3313	People inside them were not allowed to leave, military commanders attended annual study sessions as they had done in the 1970s, and military aid continued to flow to the faction from China.
3314	8 The CGDK was unveiled in the middle of 1982  To display its territorial base, some of its followers and armed units moved a few miles across the border into Cambodia.
3315	DK representatives assumed control of the CGDK’s foreign affairs (for a government in exile, the only meaningful portfolio) and stayed on at the United Nations.
3316	Its military forces were the best trained, most numerous, and most active of the three factions.
3317	Sihanouk remained in Beijng under Chinese supervision, and Son Sann soon lost even his limited freedom of maneuver  For the next ten years, the three factions continued to distrust each other, and their spokesmen made no promises about what Cambodians might expect if the coalition ever came to power  Militarily, coalition forces, some forty thousand men and women, were not particularly effective.
3318	In 1983–85 Vietnamese and PRK troops drove the coalition’s forces and their dependents back into Thailand and destroyed their encampments.
3319	The PRK then conscripted tens of thousands of workers to lay mines along the border and to block the approaches from Thailand into Cambodia.
3320	Thousands died of disease and from land mines while this work was going on.
3321	9 By 1983 the Vietnamese had raised and trained a PRK army, thirty thousand strong, to defend the country when they eventually withdrew.
3322	As in the past, conscription was often random, and privileged Cambodians, particularly the children of PRPK cadres, often seemed immune.
3323	Instead, they were favored for scholarships to study overseas.
3324	By 1988 some five thousand Cambodians had undergone technical or academic training abroad, principally in the Soviet Union, Cuba, and Eastern Europe.
3325	10 For the rest of the 1980s a military stalemate prevailed, but following the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops in 1989, coalition troops consolidated their bases inside the country, and DK troops captured the gem:producing area near Pailin in northwestern Cambodia.
3326	Their forces were unable or unwilling to follow this action up, and the resistance never controlled any major towns.
3327	Nonetheless, in 1990–91, DK forces in particular posed a serious menace to the PRK  DK troops had occupied sparsely populated parts of Cambodia’s northwest and southwest.
3328	At night they raided villages and planted antipersonnel mines along paths and in rice fields, which sooner or later killed unwary people or blew off their arms or legs.
3329	Eighty or ninety casualties caused by these mines came into Cambodia’s hospitals and clinics every week, and presumably hundreds of other victims were untreated or had been killed.
3330	The war waged allegedly against the Vietnamese, like Lon Nol’s in the 1970s, was now killing only Khmer  Casualties from mines continued through the 1990s, until the minefields had been cleared by international NGOs working with Khmer trainees.
3331	THE VIETNAMESE WITHDRAWAL Two key factors encouraged the Vietnamese to withdraw the last of their troops from Cambodia in September 1989  One was the growing selfsufficiency of the PRK, which earlier in the year had renamed itself the State of Cambodia (SOC).
3332	Another was that Soviet aid, and aid from the Soviet bloc, was sharply reduced in 1989 following crises that swept through the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
3333	Prior to the withdrawal the Cambodian government announced a series of reforms that were widely popular, especially in Phnom Penh.
3334	These included revising the national anthem, changing the flag, amending the constitution to make Buddhism Cambodia’s state religion, and abolishing the PRK statute that had limited monkhood to middle:aged Khmer  New laws also allowed farmers to pass title to land on to their children and householders to buy and sell real estate.
3335	The death penalty was abolished in response to criticism of Cambodia’s human rights record.
3336	Although the PRPK remained in charge of Cambodia’s political life, free markets and black markets flourished, traditional cultural activities revived, and collectivism was dead.
3337	The Cambodian government, on the other hand, remained unchanged.
3338	Hun Sen, who had become prime minister of the PRK in 1985, steadily consolidated his power 11 The new laws regarding Buddhism led to heavy expenditures, especially by émigré Khmers, on Buddhist wats throughout the country.
3339	Lifting restrictions on real estate produced a miniboom in speculation, restoration, and rebuilding as Phnom Penh families squatting in villas with government permission put the villas on the market inspired by rumors of peace and the hopes of renewed foreign aid that would presumably follow.
3340	During the boom, visitors to Phnom Penh noted the emergence of a small, new elite identifiable by the cars they drove, the villas they lived in, and their often:obnoxious behavior in restaurants and bars.
3341	Corruption in the SOC never reached the levels that had existed under Sihanouk or Lon Nol, but a quiet extraction of privileges had characterized PRPK cadres and high:ranking government officials over the years.
3342	Many of them had shouldered their way into business enterprises, including clandestine trading operations between Thailand and the northwest:: others were assured comfortable houses, cars, and other perquisites.
3343	Political changes in Eastern Europe and the economic boom elsewhere in Southeast Asia gave the SOC some freedom of maneuver and threatened its existence.
3344	Changes in Europe cut off aid from Communist powers, and the boom encouraged entrepreneurs and SOC officials to seek short:term returns from construction and the sale of government property and raw materials.
3345	Timber, gems, dried fish, and other products exported illicitly to Thailand and Vietnam earned little or no revenue for the SOC which, deprived of extensive foreign assistance, was almost without funds.
3346	The resistance factions, on the other hand, whose subsistence needs were met by the United Nations and foreign aid and who had few bureaucrats to pay and no services to provide, enjoyed the advantages of all guerrilla movements.
3347	Many of Cambodia’s problems were still imposed from outside the country as they had so often been.
3348	In 1989–90 most observers agreed that, without drastic changes in the foreign support that the SOC and the government in exile were receiving, their problems would remain unsolved.
3349	In July 1990, however, US  Secretary of State James Baker announced that the United States would cease backing the CGDK’s representative at the United Nations.
3350	Baker’s move encouraged China to diminish its patronage of DK, and observers soon became optimistic about the possibility of a diplomatic breakthrough regarding Cambodia.
3351	Some hoped that the breakthrough would involve a massive intervention by the United Nations, which might establish a caretaker regime pending national elections.
3352	THE UNTAC PERIOD AND AFTER These hopes were fulfilled by decisions made at the international conference on Cambodia that convened in Paris in October 1991  Under the terms of agreements reached in Paris, a temporary government was established in Phnom Penh comprising representatives of the incumbent regime and delegates from the factions that had been opposing it since 1981  The four factions joined to form a Supreme National Council (SNC) presided over by Prince Sihanouk, who returned briefly to Cambodia in November 1991 after twelve years of exile and was warmly welcomed in Phnom Penh.
3353	The SNC’s decisions were to be monitored by UN representatives on the spot.
3354	The Paris agreements coincided with the end of the Cold War  They withdrew the patronage of larger powers from the Cambodian factions, reinserting them in theory into a nonaligned Cambodia where they would be free to compete for political advantage.
3355	Those in power in Phnom Penh, however, enjoyed the advantages that usually flow to political incumbents.
3356	The arrangements envisaged in Paris were to be monitored in Cambodia by UN personnel, pending disarmament and cantonment of the factional troops, the repatriation of refugees from Thailand, and national elections for a constituent assembly.
3357	To achieve these goals, the UN established a multinational protectorate over Cambodia.
3358	During 1992 some thirteen thousand soldiers and over seven thousand civilians including detachments of police took up residence in the country.
3359	Sluggish UN procedures delayed recruitment and deployment.
3360	The United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) arrived too late and moved too slowly to gain the respect it needed from the Cambodian factions.
3361	In May 1992 the Khmer Rouge expanded the territory under their control, refused to be monitored by the UN, and refused to disarm its forces.
3362	They were not punished or chastised.
3363	The SOC, in response, also refused to disarm and refused to allow the UN to oversee the daily operations of its powerful national police, although such oversight was a feature of the Paris agreements.
3364	12 UNTAC embarked on its Utopian mission slowly and with understandable foreboding.
3365	Its mandate was ambiguous, its time was limited, and most of its personnel knew nothing about Cambodia.
3366	By the time the mission ended in October 1993, UNTAC had spent over $2 billion, making it the most costly operation to date in UN history.
3367	Much of the money had gone into inflated salaries.
3368	Phnom Penh grew more crowded and more prosperous, but the rural economy remained stagnant.
3369	The country’s infrastructure was still abysmal, and security was marred by a spate of politically motivated killings.
3370	Khmer Rouge forces, claiming that Vietnam remained secretly in control of the country, massacred over a hundred Vietnamese civilians in the UNTAC era.
3371	The SOC police, in turn, targeted activists belonging to opposing political parties.
3372	In 1992–93 over two hundred unarmed people were victims of politically motivated assassinations.
3373	None of the offenders was ever arrested or brought to trial.
3374	On a positive note, the Cambodian media enjoyed unaccustomed freedom in the UNTAC period.
3375	Local human rights organizations, unthinkable in earlier times, also flourished.
3376	These organizations received Sihanouk’s support and backing from the human rights component of UNTAC, which trained hundreds of Khmer human rights workers and investigated hundreds of complaints.
3377	Other positive developments in this period, from UNTAC’s point of view, were the peaceful repatriation of over three hundred thousand Cambodian refugees from Thailand and the national elections themselves, which took place on schedule in July 1993 following a massive voterregistration campaign conducted by UN workers.
3378	Contrary to the fears of many, the elections, although boycotted by the Khmer Rouge, were peaceful.
3379	Over 90 percent of the registered voters—at least 4 million people—went to the polls in Cambodia’s freest, fairest, and most secret election since the colonial era.
3380	The message that the voters delivered was ambiguous.
3381	A royalist party using the acronym FUNCINPEC and led by Prince Sihanouk’s eldest son, Norodom Rannaridh, won seven more seats for a constituent assembly than the Cambodian Peoples’ Party (CPP), the lineal descendant of the KPRP  An anti:Communist, anti:Vietnamese party won ten of the remaining eleven seats.
3382	For the first time in their history, a majority of Cambodians had voted against an armed, incumbent government.
3383	Unlike most Cambodian voters in the past, they had courageously rejected the status quo.
3384	What they were voting for, aside from peace, was much less clear  Hun Sen and the CPP, however refused to accept defeat.
3385	By the end of 1993, a fragile compromise was reached whereby FUNCINPEC and the CPP formed a coalition government with two prime ministers, Prince Rannaridh and Hun Sen.
3386	Cabinet posts were divided among the parties represented in the assembly.
3387	Day:to:day political power in the form of provincial governorships, defense, the national police, and the entire civil service remained under CPP control.
3388	The royalist party soon lost its voice in decision making as well as its freedom of maneuver  Cambodia’s new constitution restored the monarchy and placed Sihanouk on the throne he had abandoned in 1955  Becoming king again pleased the 71:year:old monarch and his wife, who were eager to erase a personally humiliating period of history and to reestablish themselves as Cambodia’s legitimate rulers.
3389	For the rest of the 1990s, however, with the monarch pleading poor health, the couple spent long periods of each year outside the country.
3390	The losers in 1993, aside from the people who had voted against the government, were the Khmer Rouge.
3391	The movement was formally outlawed in 1994, and thousands of its followers defected to the government.
3392	Its leaders remained unrepentant, in hiding, and in good health.
3393	In the mid:1990s the Khmer Rouge still had over five thousand men and women under arms.
3394	As Thai government support for the movement faded in 1994–95, however, and as defections increased, the Khmer Rouge became more violent, massacring timber workers, kidnapping and killing a half:dozen foreigners, and mounting sporadic military attacks.
3395	Scattered evidence at the time, confirmed later, suggested that the leadership had fragmented after the elections, and that the movement was split between those willing to effect a modus vivendi with the Phnom Penh authorities and those wanting to rekindle a fullscale revolutionary conflict.
3396	THE END OF THE KHMER ROUGE Ieng Sary, the former DK foreign minister, defected to Phnom Penh in August 1996  He quickly received a royal pardon and was allowed to remain, with thousands of adherents, in his enclave of Pailin.
3397	Over the next few months, hundreds of Khmer Rouge soldiers were absorbed into the national army.
3398	Efforts inaugurated at the time to bring the Khmer Rouge leaders to trial for crimes against humanity, despite or perhaps partly because of foreign pressure, came to nothing.
3399	13 During this time the Khmer Rouge fragmented further  The effective leader of the disintegrating movement was Ta Mok, a brutal military commander  Pol Pot, suffering from poor health, was sidelined, but in June 1997, in an effort to regain control, the former dictator ordered the assassination of Son Sen, a high:ranking cadre and close associate whom he accused of treason.
3400	The assassination, which involved killing Son Sen’s children and grandchildren, shocked middle:ranking Khmer Rouge cadre, who assumed they might be next.
3401	Fearing arrest, Pol Pot fled his headquarters but was soon captured and put on trial in a bizarre proceeding filmed by the American journalist Nate Thayer, who had been invited to attend.
3402	Subjected to the brutal winners’ justice that had sent hundreds of thousands of Cambodians to their deaths in the DK era, Pol Pot was condemned to life imprisonment, and was led away under guard to his two:room house.
3403	14 THE COUP DE FORCE OF 1997 In the meantime the Phnom Penh regime was encountering difficulties of its own.
3404	A grenade attack against peacefully demonstrating supporters of Sam Rainsy in March 1997 claimed over twenty lives, and perennial tensions between the CCP and FUNCINPEC were exacerbated by Hun Sen’s acceptance of so many Khmer Rouge defectors into the national army, and in effect into his entourage.
3405	Generals loyal to FUNCINPEC sought without success to negotiate with Khmer Rouge elements led by Ta Mok.
3406	Their efforts angered Hun Sen, and in July 1997, using troops of his personal bodyguard, he launched a preemptive coup against FUNCINPEC troops and followers in Phnom Penh.
3407	In the attack over a hundred FUNCINPEC officials and supporters were killed, several of them after being arrested and tortured.
3408	CCP casualties were minimal.
3409	Widespread looting accompanied the coup.
3410	15 Although the violence of the coup was not surprising, its timing from an international perspective was inept.
3411	Several donor nations suspended aid.
3412	Foreign investment dried up.
3413	Cambodia’s membership in ASEAN was delayed.
3414	After consolidating his power in a manner that had seemed appropriate, Hun Sen was treated for a time as a pariah.
3415	Donor nations urged him to sponsor free and fair elections in 1998, as scheduled, for the National Assembly.
3416	Neither the CCP nor FUNCINPEC wanted to repeat the experience of 1993  The CCP feared another defeat, while FUNCINPEC and smaller parties feared a renewal of violence.
3417	Nonetheless, as negotiations for elections crept forward, many observers believed that the CCP would gain an overwhelming victory.
3418	The run:up to the 1998 election seemed to confirm these suspicions.
3419	Opposition parties were given no access to the electronic media and were not allowed to campaign in the countryside.
3420	Opposition party workers were harassed, and several died under suspicious circumstances.
3421	None of the perpetrators of violence in the coup was brought to justice.
3422	Prince Rannaridh returned to the country in March 1998, less than four months before the elections, and campaigned with surprising vigor  So did Sam Rainsy, who courageously attacked the CCP and drew widespread support.
3423	The elections themselves were free and fair in the view of local and foreign electoral observers.
3424	Parties opposed to the CCP garnered 60 percent of the votes but were unwilling to form an alliance, and so arrangements were made between FUNCINPEC and the CCP to govern the country in another coalition.
3425	By the end of 1998 the new government had gotten off to a relatively good start.
3426	In April 1999 Cambodia was welcomed into ASEAN, the last country in the region to be admitted.
3427	16 Political, social and economic conditions in Cambodia at the end of the twentieth century were unsettling to most observers.
3428	The country suffered from the highest infant mortality rates in Southeast Asia.
3429	Less than a third of the population had access to clean water, and 2 percent of the adult population suffered from HIV/AIDS  The government, which spent only 5 percent of its funds on health, spent 40 percent on defense, largely to pay its enormous army, which by 2003 consisted of one hundred thousand soldiers, five hundred of whom were generals.
3430	Foreign donors and NGOs, despite officially expressed impatience, continued to pay for much of Cambodia’s health care, education, social welfare, and rural development—all areas of the economy where there were few opportunities for people to get rich.
3431	Year after year, anticorruption laws were drafted in the National Assembly (usually by opposition members) but died in committee.
3432	The educational system functioned so poorly that illiteracy, running at over 50 percent, was higher than it had been in the 1960s.
3433	Violent crimes, rare in prerevolutionary times, were now frequent, and unrestrained logging often carried out by military units was having disastrous ecological effects.

3435	More positively, in 1999 Cambodia was at peace for the first time since the 1960s.
3436	For the first time in decades its government was not dependent on a predominant foreign patron.
3437	Instead, Cambodia was taking part in the affairs of Southeast Asia from which the Cold War and its own regimes had placed it at arm’s length since independence.
3438	Despite Hun Sen’s authoritarian style, print media in Cambodia were relatively unrestrained, and foreign human rights organizations were still free to operate in the country.
3439	Fueled by its burgeoning garment industry, which provided employment to over three hundred thousand young women, and by a boom in tourism, Cambodia’s GDP grew by an a average of 6 percent a year between 1998 and 2006  The rural economy, on the other hand, grew more slowly.
3440	As a mixed blessing, Cambodia’s population doubled between 1979 and 2006 when it reached 14 million, even though one baby in ten died at birth or shortly thereafter  Nearly 40 percent of the population was under sixteen.
3441	In the first years of the new century, Hun Sen, who relished the title of strong man, astutely consolidated himself in power  He was heavily guarded and could count on the support of the army, most of the CPP, and local business interests buttressed by unconditional aid from China.
3442	He was popular in the countryside where patronage networks were largely controlled by the CPP and where his alleged personal largesse (often financed by foreign donors), like Sihanouk’s in the past, produced shortterm waves of adulation.
3443	So did his marathon speeches and his robust, often brutal use of language.
3444	His disdain for parliamentary procedures was as intense as Sihanouk’s had been, and so was his indifference to the rule of law.
3445	Under Hun Sen, no officials have ever been convicted of corruption, and no one suspected of political assassinations has ever come to trial.
3446	In other ways Hun Sen is a new type of national leader  Unlike previous Cambodian rulers, he had spent no time as a monk.
3447	Unlike Sihanouk, Lon Nol, and Pol Pot, he has not shown much interest in Cambodia’s past except as a source of revenue from tourists, over a million of whom visited Cambodia in 2005 and again in 2006  Perhaps because he owed his position to the Vietnamese, he never indulged in the racialist anti:Vietnamese rhetoric of some of his opponents.
3448	Finally, Hun Sen was to a large extent a self:made man, without ongoing obligations to foreign patrons.
3449	Arguably he has been the first genuinely modern leader of the country.
3450	His eagerness for Cambodia to become a prosperous, modern nation—like Singapore, or Malaysia, perhaps—was obviously sincere, but his inability or unwillingness to crack down on widespread corruption in the government and to divert revenue from the army and other favored bodies to the countryside impeded economic progress and discouraged long:term foreign investment.
3451	17 TWENTY:FIRST:CENTURY CAMBODIA In 2002, CPP candidates captured two:thirds of the communes in national commune elections (for over ten thousand communes in the country).
3452	At the time, Hun Sen said that he would be happy to rule the country for another ten years at least.
3453	However, in the National Assembly elections of 2003—declared free and fair again by local and foreign observers— opposition to the CPP was still substantial, especially in Phnom Penh and other large towns.
3454	In these elections fewer people went to the polls than previously.
3455	The CPP gained five seats, FUNCINPEC lost seventeen, and the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) gained nine.
3456	The CPP was unable to assemble the two:thirds parliamentary majority set out by the constitution as a mandate to govern the country.
3457	A stalemate occurred that lasted for several months, until a new CPP:FUNCINPEC coalition brokered by Hun Sen and his colleagues was formed, with Prince Rannaridh sidelined and the CPP firmly in command.
3458	18 Earlier in the year, riots in Phnom Penh destroyed the Thai embassy and severely damaged several Thai:owned businesses in the capital.
3459	The rioters were responding to rumors that a Thai TV actress had claimed in her program (erroneously, as things turned out) that Angkor “belonged to the Thai.
3460	It seems likely that the riots had Hun Sen’s informal backing (police and firefighters were very slow to react), and that commercial rivalries between Thai and Cambodian companies of interest to those in power in Phnom Penh were involved.
3461	Using funds provided for the most part by Cambodian:owned casinos operating along the Thai border that catered to Thai gamblers, Cambodia swiftly paid the $20 million that Bangkok demanded as reparations, and diplomatic relations resumed.
3462	The riots showed that mobs could be quickly organized in the capital, especially when Cambodia’s amour propre was challenged, that large sums of money could be raised quickly by the government for unexpected crises, and that Cambodian resentment, especially in Phnom Penh, about Thai domination of the Khmer economy ran deep.
3463	19 In October 2004, Norodom Sihanouk, in ill health and exhausted by years of verbal conflict with Hun Sen, resigned from the kingship.
3464	His youngest son, Norodom Sihamoni, a mild:mannered bachelor who had spent most of his life outside the country, succeeded him.
3465	For some time, portraits of Sihamoni joined those of his parents in public buildings without replacing them, but Sihanouk no longer took part in royal ceremonies and continued to spend almost all of his time in Beijing.
3466	Siahmoni’s childlessness and Hun Sen’s ongoing wariness toward the palace may foreshadow the eventual demise of monarchy as an institution in Cambodia—perhaps after Sihanouk’s death.
3467	20 Two key developments in Cambodia since 2004 have been the discovery of massive oil deposits in parts of the Gulf of Thailand that lie in Cambodia’s territorial waters and the establishment in 2006, after years of negotiations, of a tribunal in Phnom Penh to indict former leaders of the Khmer Rouge.
3468	Offshore oil exploration, dominated by the US  firm Chevron:Texaco, began in 2000, following assessments made in prerevolutionary times, and cost the firm over $20 million.
3469	In 2006 Chevron announced that Cambodia had confirmed deposits of seven hundred million barrels of oil and perhaps ten million cubic feet of natural gas.
3470	Because these estimates applied only to those portions of the area already explored by the firm, the actual deposits could be much higher  The deposits should provide annual revenues of $1 billion, starting in 2009 or 2010, for at least a decade.
3471	21 This amount is twice Cambodia’s current (2006) annual budget and roughly twice the amount that the kingdom receives every year from foreign donors.
3472	Whether the deposits will turn out to be a blessing or a curse remains to be seen.
3473	The result will depend on how the revenue is spent by the government, especially in an era when foreign assistance will be significantly lower because of the deposits.
3474	Given the government’s failure to account for the uses of tourist revenue—the entry fees to the Angkor park in particular—and its unwillingness to tax wealthy members of society so as to pay more for health, social welfare, infrastructure, and education, it is hard to predict that the oil revenues will be used to any great extent to pull Cambodia’s rural poor out of grinding poverty or to improve the welfare of the entire population.
3475	Negotiations between the Cambodian government and the United Nations for an international tribunal to indict leaders of the Khmer Rouge proceeded by fits and starts for almost a decade before agreement was reached at the end of 2006  Costs of the three:year effort were estimated at $60 million, nearly all of which was met by foreign donors.
3476	The Cambodian government insisted that the tribunal take place in Cambodia with the participation of local judges and lawyers as well as international ones.
3477	It did so despite the inexperience of Cambodian jurists in cases of this kind and despite fears on the part of some international observers that the Cambodians would follow instructions from Hun Sen (who would outlast the tribunal and had never shown much enthusiasm for it) instead of demonstrating their independence.
3478	Proceedings got off to a slow start in early 2007 as procedures were being ironed out.
3479	22 CONCLUSION Cambodian political history since World War II, and probably for a much longer period, can be characterized in part as a chronic failure of contending groups of patrons and their clients to compromise, cooperate, or share power  These hegemonic tendencies, familiar in other Southeast Asian countries, have deep roots in Cambodia’s past.
3480	In the 1950s and 1960s, Prince Sihanouk’s narcissistic style encouraged his enemies when they replaced him to be equally high:handed, uncompromising, and self:absorbed.
3481	Alternative notions of pluralism or a peaceful transfer of power did not exist then and had little traction in Cambodia thirty:five years later  After 1970, Sihanouk, Lon Nol, Pol Pot, and to a lesser extent Hun Sen sought absolute power for themselves.
3482	Under Pol Pot this took the form of a national vendetta.
3483	The Leninist politics he favored and the purges he carried out were far worse than anything else in Cambodia’s recent history, but they reflected time:honored ideas of winner:takes:all political behavior  Under the Vietnamese protectorate, Cambodian politicians were more cautious (as Sihanouk had been when the French were in control), but in the post:UNTAC era those in power reverted to form and became thin:skinned, vengeful, conspiratorial, and abrupt.
3484	In Pol Pot’s secret prison in Phnom Penh, interrogators used the phrase “doing politics  to describe the ritual of indoctrination, questioning, and torture.
3485	To many Cambodians without power before and since, politics has been synonymous with exploitation alternating with neglect.
3486	The 1993 elections, for many Khmer, were an attempt to liberate themselves from the politics that had dominated the country for so long.
3487	Subsequent elections, as we have seen, failed to alter the status quo.
3488	Although it is fruitful to study Cambodian political history from a Cambodian perspective, as this book has tried to do, the country’s location, topography, and demographic weakness have meant that its history has often been entangled with Thailand and Vietnam and the polities that preceded them.
3489	These countries, in turn and because of their size, have consistently tried to patronize or absorb their neighbor  Having Vietnam next door in the 1820s and 1830s led to a Vietnamese protectorate, and de facto Thai protectorates had been in effect at several points in the preceding centuries.
3490	In the 1860s the French loosened what had become Thai control over the Cambodian court and removed Cambodia from much of Southeast Asia by making it part of Indochina, which is to say a surrogate of Vietnam.
3491	In the 1940s and 1950s, Cambodian resistance to the French was dominated by the Vietnamese and served their interests.
3492	Later still, the fighting in Vietnam, exacerbated by US  intervention, reduced Cambodia’s capacity to remain neutral or to control its eastern frontier  Sihanouk knew that his country would be swept into the fighting and could never emerge a victor  Unlike Lon Nol or Pol Pot, the prince had no illusions about Cambodia’s military strength.
3493	Before 1979 it was difficult for any Cambodian government to contemplate an alliance with Vietnam.
3494	The friendship cobbled together by Sihanouk and the Vietnamese Communists collapsed as soon as Sihanouk was overthrown.
3495	Spurred on by their resentments, Lon Nol and Pol Pot conducted doomed and vicious military campaigns against Vietnam.
3496	After Vietnam invaded the country at the end of 1978, it imposed a protectorate that was reminiscent in some ways of French colonialism and the 1830s.
3497	Relations between Cambodia and Thailand have been somewhat different.
3498	Despite, or perhaps because of, cultural affinities, relations have never been marked by a sincere effort on the part of Bangkok to treat Cambodia as a sovereign nation.
3499	In the 1830s, in World War II, and again in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1980s, the Thai worked to subvert what they perceived to be hostile governments in Phnom Penh.
3500	Relations between the two countries have recently begun to mature, but the anti:Thai riots of 2003 suggest that genuine friendship between the two peoples will be difficult to achieve.
3501	The Paris agreements, UNTAC, and the elections of 1993 thrust Cambodia into the world of Southeast Asia from which it had been isolated, by accident or design, since the eighteenth century.
3502	No longer an isolated player, a protectorate, or a component of Indochina, Cambodia became part of a region about which its people knew little and for whose modernity they were largely unprepared.
3503	Cambodia’s past greatness, as reconstructed and presented to the Cambodians by the French, is another aspect of its history that has weighed heavily on most of its leaders.
3504	In the 1950s and 1960s, Sihanouk allowed himself to be compared favorably to Jayavarman VII  Similarly, Lon Nol claimed that he had a divine mission to rescue Cambodia from “unbelievers  (thmil).
3505	Pol Pot, announcing that his forces had singlehandedly defeated the United States, was similarly misled.
3506	In his marathon 1977 speech he remarked, “If our people can build Angkor, they are capable of anything.
3507	Hun Sen, to his credit, seems to have abandoned this kind of addictive nostalgia and sees himself as the leader of a small, modernizing country in the modern world.
3508	The combination of personality, domineering political habits, proximity to Thailand and Vietnam, and unrealistic notions of innate greatness blended from the 1940s onward into a volatile form of nationalism which dominated the political scene for many years and which even now is occasionally called back into play by opposition politicians in Phnom Penh.
3509	Intense and widely shared conservatism, perhaps, and the tempestuous changes in the country since 1970 have made many Cambodians reluctant to resist or even consider changing the social arrangements and political leadership that have given them so many centuries of suffering and injustice.
3510	Traditions of deference, fatalism, and hegemony enshrined in these arrangements form much of the unwritten substance of Cambodia’s two thousand years of history and provide insights into the country’s politics and culture that are less apt when applied to Thailand or Vietnam.
3511	Much of Cambodia’s uniqueness, I would argue, springs from deep continuities or refusals, rather than from calculated or prudent responses to the rapid and often destructive influences of modern times.
3512	Pol Pot’s revolution failed in part because so many Cambodians, finding its premises painful and irrelevant, were unwilling to carry it out.
3513	Similarly, a decade of Vietnamese occupation and experiments with a far less demanding form of socialism left few lasting marks.
3514	In the 1993 elections, millions of Cambodians voted for change but chose to look backward rather than ahead.
3515	This tendency has altered in recent years, especially in the towns, but deep conservatism persists among older people and in rural areas.

3517	The so:called timelessness of Cambodia, made up to a large extent of its people’s perennial, self:absorbed terms of reference, has been part of its appeal to visitors and scholars for many years.
3518	In the Pol Pot period this conservatism was a source of enormous strength:: in the end it was conservatism that, at enormous human cost, defeated the DK regime.
3519	But as the country opens up to a confused and confusing world, without the promise of anyone’s sustained protection, it is uncertain if this inwardlooking, family:oriented conservatism, so helpful in surviving the incursions of foreign powers and foreign ideas, will be of much help if Cambodia hopes to flourish as a twenty:first:century state.
3520	It is also uncertain if notions of human rights, pluralism, and the rule of law, concepts brought into Cambodia in recent years, have taken root in a significant way among those holding power in the country, who continue to act, as previous leaders have done, as if these imported concepts had no bearing on their behavior or on how the country is governed.
3521	The predicted surge in oil revenues (discussed above) will probably reduce the leverage that foreign donors have exercised over Cambodia since 1992  Whether Cambodia’s newfound economic independence will benefit ordinary Khmer more than those in power remains to be seen.
3522	With a soaring birth rate, poor health, and a government that seems to be unprepared to be genuinely responsive to people’s needs, the prospects for the short and medium term appear to be very bleak.
3523	However, the resilience, talents, and desires of the Cambodian people, and their ability to defy predictions, suggest that a more optimistic assessment of their future might possibly be in order.

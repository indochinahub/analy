0001	Unburden yourself, my son.
0002	I was with General Sherman on his march south.
0003	What we did Evil Unspeakable things.
0004	You were a soldier.
0005	You were following orders.
0006	No.
0007	No, not just orders.
0008	We opened a dark door, and the devil stepped in.
0009	The only way to cast out the devil is to confess to God.
0010	No.
0011	No, I can't, Father.
0012	Tell me about Meridian.
0013	How do you know about Meridian? A nation, which nearly destroyed itself by civil war between north and south, can only be healed by the binding together of east and west.
0014	Mark my words, gentlemen, it will be built.
0015	The only question which remains is which one of you will join me in this mad, noble quest? Who among you will have to say in years hence that he stood idly by as this nation became an empire? And who among you will be able to say he lent a hand in making manifest our destiny as a great nation? Hear, hear.
0016	Bravo.
0017	It's all horse crap.
0018	The faster I shovel, the faster they eat it up.
0019	But it was a truly inspirational speech.
0020	Twattle and shite, I say.
0021	Then why am I here? You are here to play your part.
0022	Crédit Mobilier.
0023	Crédit Mobilier will be awarded all major construction contracts on the Union Pacific Railroad.
0024	I own it.
0025	I'm giving you the chance to get in on the ground floor.
0026	So, you'll be paying yourself to build a railroad with Government subsidies.
0027	Now that, my friend, is inspirational.
0028	Yes, it is, but I can't afford these on a senator's salary.
0029	As head of the Congressional Oversight Committee on Railroads, I'm sure you will find a way to pay for them over and over and over again.
0030	Might I ask how many shares are here? Two hundred.
0031	I think you'll find that's fair.
0032	Four hundred sounds fairer.
0033	Are you trying to renegotiate a bribe? No.
0034	Bribe  is such a dirty word.
0035	Hmm? Why don't you think on it, Doc, hmm? We've got a vote before the committee next Tuesday.
0036	Good luck with your land speculation in Nebraska.
0037	Fifty thousand acres, bought on the cheap, hmm? What would happen to the value of that land if I decided to route the railroad around it? Take the stocks, Jordan.
0038	But I've decided to renegotiate.
0039	One hundred shares.
0040	MICKEY:  He was gun Gunned down  While he   Prayed.
0041	I was getting it.
0042	Prayed  In the   Conference.
0043	Prayed in the conference?  Confessional.
0044	Someone killed the poor bugger whilst he was confessing? What is the world coming to? Well, I suppose the only consolation is that he got to heaven that much faster.
0045	How did you come by that conclusion? Well, he confessed his sins.
0046	He died in grace.
0047	So God just up and punches his ticket to heaven, huh? Well, yeah.
0048	If that's how God goes about his business, you can keep him.
0049	Keep God? Do you not believe in a higher power? Yes, sir, I wear it on my hip.
0050	Are you a gunslinger then? No.
0051	I was just heading out west, looking for work on the railroad.
0052	Yeah, so are we.
0053	To seek our fortune, as it were.
0054	I'm Mickey and this here's Sean.
0055	Cullen Bohannon.
0056	:: Mickey has twelve toes.
0057	:: And Sean but eight.
0058	Individually, we're freaks.
0059	But together, we're whole.
0060	# There's a bullet in my pocket burning a hole # It's so far from your weapon, the place you were born # There's a bullet in my pocket burning a hole # You're so far from your weapon and you wanna go home # I tried to give you whiskey but it never did work # Suddenly you're begging me to do so much work # Right away from the get go, the bullet was cursed # Ever since I had you, every little thing hurts # You wanna get up, let go, I said no # You wanna get up, let go # Next.
0061	Name? Cullen Bohannon.
0062	Railroad experience? None.
0063	Why should I hire you? I'm willing to do just about anything.
0064	Uh-huh.
0065	You and a thousand others.
0066	I ain't got no place else to go, sir.
0067	Save it.
0068	Will you work the cut crew? - Yeah.
0069	- Yeah? What's the cut crew? Oh, it's brutal work.
0070	It is not for the faint of heart.
0071	It gets hotter than a whore house on nickel night out there.
0072	I ain't afraid of hard work.
0073	You're a Johnny Reb, aren't you? Yes, sir.
0074	I could tell by that Griswold you're carrying.
0075	It was a Griswold like that that took off my hand.
0076	Well, we all paid a price, Mr Bohannon, and I imagine you bear your own scars.
0077	I was a Copperhead before the war.
0078	So, I bear no hard feelings towards you graybacks.
0079	You did what you had to do.
0080	It's the darkies I blame.
0081	The way I see it, they owe me far more than just a hand.
0082	Say, did you own slaves, Mr Bohannon? I did.
0083	Well, then I imagine you know your way around a nigger.
0084	This is Mr Bohannon, your walking boss.
0085	You can address him as Boss or Boss Man or Walking Boss.
0086	Mr Bohannon is a former master of slaves.
0087	Some things don't never change.
0088	So he's up to your tricks.
0089	He's going to work the blue out of your gums, boys.
0090	Any coffee boilers or otherwise slack work ethic will be dealt with severely.
0091	Now, dig me a cut.
0092	# Pass me not, O gentle savior Jesus Christ, accept this humble servant into your heart.
0093	# Hear my humble cry # While on others Thou art calling Be reborn in the glory of Jesus.
0094	# Do not pass me by # Savior Brother Joseph Your sins are washed away.
0095	# Hear my humble cry # # Oh, what a beautiful city # Oh, what a beautiful city # Oh, what a beautiful city # Twelve gates to the city Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, whoa.
0096	Easy, easy, boy.
0097	# There's three gates in the east # There's three gates in the west # Right here.
0098	Unload the tent.
0099	Raise the church.
0100	In this den of thieves, I shall build a house of the Lord.
0101	You putting up a church here? What better place to convert the wicked, sister? You better keep an eye on your flock, Reverend.
0102	We do our own share of convertin' around here.
0103	Why have you made my roads so straight? Are we not in a race with the Central Pacific? The Central Pacific? Those imbeciles will never make it out of Sacramento.
0104	They're so desperate, I hear they're hiring chinks.
0105	What I was thinking was something more like this.
0106	But we're building over flat land, why wouldn't we make it straight?  Why wouldn't we make it straight?  he asks.
0107	Take a closer look.
0108	Let me elucidate.
0109	In case you haven't heard, this undertaking is being subsidized by the enormous teat of the Federal Government.
0110	This never-ending, money-gushing nipple pays me $16,000, per mile, yet you build my road straight! You're fired.
0111	Get out.
0112	I said, get out.
0113	You look like a bright, young man.
0114	This land It's bewitching.
0115	It hasn't changed since Lewis and Clark first saw it 60 years ago.
0116	Do you ever wonder if our work here will be the ruin of all of this? Progress comes with a cost, Lily.
0117	I just think it's so much more beautiful without people.
0118	Don't fool yourself.
0119	There are plenty of people here.
0120	We're entering Cheyenne territory.
0121	You do remember our agreement? You mean our agreement regarding my not leaving your side while you're ill? No.
0122	I mean, our agreement that you should go back to Chicago once we entered hostile Indian territory.
0123	Yes, my dear, but it was before you took ill.
0124	Yeah.
0125	I believe our second agreement supersedes our first.
0126	Oh, dear God, now you sound like a lawyer.
0127	If you want me to go to Chicago, lead the way.
0128	I'm not leaving without you, Robert.
0129	Don't tempt me, Lily.
0130	I might just do it.
0131	You play me for dumb.
0132	You've worked at this for too long to go back now.
0133	We've worked at this.
0134	This This would mean nothing to me if you weren't here to share it.
0135	Robert Bell, are you hiding something in your trousers? It must be all this fresh air.
0136	Breathe deeply.
0137	So, uh So how many slaves did you own? Five in all.
0138	I had me a small tobacco farm.
0139	Any women? Two.
0140	You ever sample the goods? Uh-uh.
0141	It wasn't like that.
0142	Call.
0143	You bitter that you had to give up your slaves? I gave them their freedom a year before the war started.
0144	Are you serious? I kept them on at wages.
0145	You are an odd duck, Bohannon.
0146	I married a northerner.
0147	She convinced me of the evils of slavery.
0148	So, you You released your slaves, yet you still fought in the war.
0149	Why? Honor.
0150	The southerner and his honor.
0151	Where is your wife now? She's dead.
0152	Did the war take her? Something like that.
0153	Think they heard us? Who cares? I don't want to torment the poor bastards out here alone in the middle of nowhere.
0154	They have their hands.
0155	Ohh.
0156	I feel this cough is going to be the death of me.
0157	Nonsense.
0158	:: Nonsense.
0159	- Lily If I were to die Robert Please Please don't talk like that.
0160	Don't talk like that.
0161	The maps.
0162	We have to save the work.
0163	Run for the trees.
0164	Don't look back.
0165	Shh.
0166	No, please, no.
0167	Robert! Rise and shine, Bohannon.
0168	It's another beautiful day on the railroad.
0169	Get up! Get up! Come on! My horse.
0170	My horse.
0171	My kingdom for a horse.
0172	Hoe that line.
0173	Half-hour to lunch! Half-hour! Peckerwood.
0174	He ain't so bad.
0175	Shut your dumb black ass up.
0176	- I don't need no slave boss motivatin' me.
0177	:: Mmm-hmm.
0178	Come on! Help me out here.
0179	# All them pretty gals gonna be there # Shuck that corn before you eat Come on! Come on! I say # All them pretty gals gonna be there # Shuck that corn before you eat # They gonna fix it for us rare # Shuck that corn before you eat # I know that supper gonna be big # Shuck that corn before you eat # I think I smell a fire roast pig # Shuck that corn before you eat Keep it going.
0180	# I hope they got some whiskey there # You might want to take a look at this, sir.
0181	:: Put it in the pile.
0182	:: No, sir.
0183	You really need to look at this.
0184	Dear God.
0185	Robert Bell is dead.
0186	:: Is this the entire message? - Yes, sir.
0187	Nothing about - Maps being found? - No, sir.
0188	One last telegram.
0189	To the Union Pacific Board of Directors,  change of plans.
0190	Stop.
0191	Heading for Hell on Wheels immediately.
0192	Stop.
0193	Send it.
0194	You need some water.
0195	No, it ain't break time yet.
0196	Come on, you need some water.
0197	Come on.
0198	Come on.
0199	I thought I told you to dump that dirt on the other side.
0200	:: Hey.
0201	:: Shut your mouth.
0202	I told him to do it.
0203	We fixing to fill in that dip over yonder next.
0204	I figured we might just as well have some fill dirt nearby.
0205	You talk to me before any decisions are made, all right? Yes, sir, master.
0206	What did you say? Bohannon, what the hell is going on here? You drink when I tell you to drink! Get up! Willy! Willy! Willy! Willy! This is what happens when you break my rules.
0207	Now, what you planning on doing with that Arkansas Toothpick, huh? Don't do it.
0208	We ain't on no plantation no more, walking boss.
0209	Ain't nothing good gonna come from this.
0210	Yeah, well, ain't nothing good coming from this either.
0211	That dumb nigger actually thought this was gonna change things.
0212	Look where that got him.
0213	Might just as well wipe my ass with it.
0214	You kill him, you will hang.
0215	How they gonna hang me if there ain't no witnesses? You come at me with a knife, son, you better be ready to use it.
0216	Yeah.
0217	You got to let go of the past.
0218	Have you let it go? You're doing quite a trade here.
0219	Not bad for a couple of Irish bumpkins.
0220	Where's Mickey? He's preparing for the grand finale.
0221	# When you're far away # Far from the land you'll be Do you not pine for your own homeland, Mr Bohannon? No.
0222	And why is that? It's gone.
0223	# Bright and fair # And rich in its treasures # Muldoon # # Won't you come back soon # Love you # So, tell me, Bohannon, did you see the elephant during the war? Yes, I saw my share of action, yeah.
0224	Where? Yeah.
0225	I don't like to talk about it.
0226	I loved the war.
0227	I loved the war! The best thing that ever happened to me.
0228	I thought you said you were against it? Oh, yeah, I was.
0229	But that doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy myself once pressed into service.
0230	Hey! Oh, hey, I'm skint.
0231	No, this one's on me.
0232	Well, thank you.
0233	Most men shrink when they see the elephant up close.
0234	Oh, yeah? - But I blossomed.
0235	:: Mmm-hmm.
0236	Thank you.
0237	Though I I must admit that there were certain lines that I crossed, lines of morality that I didn't think myself capable of crossing.
0238	But that's what men do in war.
0239	Moral men don't.
0240	So, you did nothing that you were ashamed of? I did plenty I was ashamed of.
0241	You ever been to Meridian, Mississippi, Mr Johnson? That is my Remington pointed at your gut.
0242	So, let's take a walk out back.
0243	I know about the two men you killed in Maryland.
0244	I read in the paper about Prescott getting killed in that church by a Griswold.
0245	But I'll be damned if you didn't show up a few days later with a Griswold strapped to your hip, as plain as day.
0246	And then you ask me about Meridian? That cinched it.
0247	I am not proud of what happened to your wife, Bohannon.
0248	It didn't happen to her.
0249	You did it to her.
0250	Yes.
0251	Yes, we did it to her.
0252	I did it to her.
0253	Your wife was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
0254	I want you to know, it wasn't my idea to kill her.
0255	She hung herself.
0256	No, she didn't.
0257	The sergeant strangled her and strung her up.
0258	Sergeant? What sergeant? Oh, he's out here, too.
0259	I figured you were saving him for last.
0260	Oh, you didn't know about him? You tell me who he is.
0261	Well, it hardly matters now.
0262	No! Tell me his name.
0263	Tell me his name.
0264	Is it a villain you want? I'll play the part.
0265	After all, what is a drama without a villain? What is the building of this grand road if not a drama? This business is not for the weak of heart.
0266	It is a thorny, brutal affair that rewards the lion for his ferocity.
0267	What of the zebra? What of the poor zebra? Well, the zebra is eaten as the zebra should be.
0268	Make no mistake.
0269	Blood will be spilled.
0270	Lives will be lost.
0271	Fortunes will be made.
0272	Men will be ruined.
0273	There will be betrayal and scandal.
0274	And perfidy of epic proportions.
0275	But the lion shall prevail.
0276	You see, the secret I know is this.
0277	All of history is driven by the lion.
0278	We drag the poor zebra, kicking and braying, staining the earth with his cheap blood.
0279	History doesn't remember us fondly, but then history is written by the zebra for the zebra.
0280	One hundred years hence, when this railroad spans the continent and America rises to be the greatest power the world has seen, I will be remembered as a caitiff, malefactor, who only operated out of greed for personal gain.
0281	All true.
0282	All true.
0283	But remember this, without me, and men like me, your glorious railroad would never have been built.
0284	It's Durant.
0285	What the hell is he doing here? - Are you the Chicago Tribune reporter? - Yes.
0286	Did you photograph this body? Yes, sir, Mr Durant.
0287	But just the one body.
0288	What is wrong with you, man? - I'm sorry.
0289	I thought - Just the one won't do.
0290	Get those bodies back off the wagons.
0291	Come on, snap to, boys.
0292	I want this scene photographed exactly as you found it.
0293	I want an unblinking look at the horror perpetrated here.
0294	More arrows.
0295	We need more arrows.
0296	He can't feel anything.
0297	He's dead, for God's sake.
0298	The maps.
0299	:: Did you find them? - No, sir.
0300	Nothing anywhere.
0301	Keep looking.
0302	Mr Durant, over here.
0303	Robert.
0304	Pack up everything.
0305	Bring it all back to Hell on Wheels.
0306	They found Johnson's body.
0307	Everybody back at the camp talking about it.
0308	Get the hell back on that cut.
0309	Cullen Bohannon? Did you hear about Daniel Johnson's murder? Who wants to know? Why you so spooked, son? I guess I still ain't quite cottoned to the sight of Union blue riding up on me.
0310	Well, you ought to be happy to see us.
0311	Yeah, why is that? The boss wants to talk to you about taking Johnson's job.
0312	Come on.
0313	Here you go, Mickey.
0314	:: Thanks.
0315	:: Yeah.
0316	I thank thee, Lord, for this bounty you have placed before me.
0317	Sit down.
0318	Sit down.
0319	Horse thief.
0320	Thor Gundersen.
0321	Head of security for Mr Thomas Durant.
0322	They call me The Swede.
0323	I'm Norwegian.
0324	But no matter.
0325	We are all Americans now.
0326	Hmm? Even you rebels, yes? Daniel Johnson told me that the two of you was cut from the same cloth.
0327	Yeah, I don't think so.
0328	Why is that? Did you not like him? He's my boss.
0329	That's about all there was to it.
0330	And drinking companion, yes? We tore it up some.
0331	I understand the two of you was tearing it up some on the night he was murdered.
0332	In fact, you were seen leaving the saloon with him.
0333	Hmm? Yeah.
0334	I'm not here to talk about Johnson's job, am I? Is that what they told you? You a law man, Mr Swede? Hmm? Because I don't see no badge.
0335	No.
0336	There's no official law out here yet.
0337	Then what authority you got to be interrogating me? Mr Durant has appointed me to bring some order to the chaos out here.
0338	When was the last time you took a look outside, Mr Swede? Looks to me like chaos is winning.
0339	Well, when harlots and dipsomaniacs are killed, I lose not a minute's sleep.
0340	But Daniel Johnson was a valuable asset to Mr Durant.
0341	Daniel Johnson was hated by just about every man who worked for him.
0342	Any with a reason to kill him? Perhaps one of the Negroes? I heard he had some trouble with them.
0343	I don't know nothing about that.
0344	Hmm Yeah.
0345	Yeah.
0346	Well, that leaves only you then.
0347	You know what? I'm done here.
0348	This ain't no court.
0349	This here's Beauty.
0350	She's an old piece, but she still shoots true.
0351	I'm gonna give you a chance to confess to this crime.
0352	Where is she? Hello, little brother.
0353	What are you doing way out here? Where's the woman? I don't have her.
0354	Yet.
0355	You kill white men, it's one thing.
0356	But you take one of their women, you'll have every damn one of them hunting you down.
0357	I'll count coup and get more scalps.
0358	I hope it was worth it.
0359	What about the scalps you took? You act so pure now, but I remember there was a time when you loved the taste of blood.
0360	Jesus has forgiven me for that.
0361	Jesus may have forgiven you, but do you think your white friends would? You better find her before I do.
0362	Hey.
0363	Hey! You'd be surprised how fast you get used to the feel of them things.
0364	What the hell are you doing here? Want to know if you fixing to be testifying on me.
0365	I don't know, ain't decided yet.
0366	I know about that sergeant.
0367	Heard Johnson say some other things, too.
0368	Things about men getting killed in churches and such.
0369	Yeah, what's your point? Point is, if I be hanging for Johnson, you gonna drop down right beside me for them folks you done killed.
0370	Tell you what.
0371	You tell your story, and then I'll tell mine.
0372	We'll see who they believe.
0373	Yeah.
0374	Who would believe some nigger slave over a white man? Relax, son.
0375	Ain't nobody hanging nobody.
0376	I ain't your damn son.
0377	Well, I'll be out of here by tomorrow.
0378	I imagine that's what that horse thief done said.
0379	Thanks.
0380	Thank you.
0381	Thanks so much.
0382	See you again.
0383	:: Good luck.
0384	:: Cheers.
0385	Good luck.
0386	Did you enjoy the show, sir? Very moving images of home, boys.
0387	But you don't sound Irish.
0388	I ain't, but my heart was moved nonetheless.
0389	We're all yearning for our homeland out here in this strange place.
0390	Excuse me, sir, have we met? We have not.
0391	Folks around here call me The Swede.
0392	You got yourself a prime location here, boys.
0393	Yes, sirree.
0394	Right between the whores and the liquor.
0395	Picked it out meself.
0396	What is it you want, Mr Swede? I like that, right to the point.
0397	And the point is, a nice location like this got a nice price attached to it.
0398	I should have realized there was a reason this spot wasn't taken.
0399	:: I should have seen this coming.
0400	- I take it, then, you're the smart one.
0401	:: Aye.
0402	:: Aye.
0403	So, how much do you want, Mr Swede? Once again, right to the point.
0404	Two dollars a week.
0405	The first payment due this Friday.
0406	But that's half our flipping take.
0407	Now, for this two dollars, you shall have my protection against all the villains that surround you in this wicked place.
0408	And what if we don't pay? Well, you can always move down to the slaughterhouse.
0409	And what if we refuse to move? And I thought you was the smart one.
0410	I used to be a bookkeeper.
0411	:: you look like a bookkeeper.
0412	:: Mmm.
0413	I was always more comfortable around numbers than people.
0414	I could control numbers.
0415	The war put a stop to that, didn't it? You're suffering from the soldier's heart, Mr Swede.
0416	Yeah, I can see it in your eyes.
0417	You're still fighting them battles.
0418	I saw no battles.
0419	I was a quartermaster.
0420	More numbers.
0421	I never even saw the enemy until our supply train was captured and I become prisoner of war.
0422	Andersonville? That's right.
0423	Way down in the great state of Georgia.
0424	Total chaos ruled.
0425	I weighed 200 pounds when I went in and 86 when I come out.
0426	I just couldn't make them numbers add up.
0427	I woke one night to one of my own men trying to eat the flesh from my arm.
0428	He thought I was dead.
0429	I realized that night I had to control people like I control numbers, and I learned to practice a sort of immoral mathematics.
0430	And I did some Not so good things in Andersonville, Mr Bohannon.
0431	In the end, I found I was able to make them numbers add up.
0432	So, have you thought about that confession? Well, I figure, by your math, you're gonna hang me either way.
0433	Yeah.
0434	You know why that man didn't finish eating your sorry ass? Hmm? 'Cause you Yankees all taste like shit.
0435	Ah! Get right with your maker, Mr Bohannon.
0436	Soon as we cut down the horse thief, you're gonna hang.
0437	Write this down.
0438	Outnumbered 5-to-1, eight white Christian souls were brutally slaughtered by the marauding, bloodthirsty war party of merciless savages.
0439	Outnumbered 5-to-1 ? Make it 10-to-1.
0440	Amongst the murdered were Robert Bell, visionary surveyor of the Union Pacific Railroad.
0441	His beautiful wife Lily, the Fair-Haired Maiden of the West, was sullied by the savage pack, then carried off into slavery in their filthy camp What does  sullied  mean again? It will mean whatever the reader wants it to mean.
0442	My road will bring civilization to these untamed western lands.
0443	And the Fair-Haired Maiden of the West represents nothing less than civilization itself.
0444	You see this as sort of a rallying cry? Yes.
0445	Now you're getting it.
0446	Save her at all costs.
0447	Well, yes, of course, save her.
0448	But I also want the federal troops brought in here to clear every single last savage from the path of my road.
0449	Welcome, brother.
0450	You must be that fellow they're looking to hang.
0451	You know, Saint Peter himself was chained like this and condemned to die.
0452	And he was freed by an angel.
0453	I ain't no Saint Peter, sir.
0454	Yeah, and I ain't no angel.
0455	Peace be with you, sir.
0456	And with you, Reverend.
0457	And with you.
0458	I hear your prisoner escaped.
0459	We'll find him.
0460	It's just a matter of time.
0461	I'll be sure to keep an eye out for him.
0462	You be careful.
0463	He's a dangerous man.
0464	Brother, we need to talk.
0465	I thought you were gonna turn me in.
0466	No.
0467	The Lord instructs me to give sanctuary even to the condemned.
0468	Yeah? What does he say about cutting off a pair of cuffs, huh? You're on your own there.
0469	You know, you'd best set things straight in your heart before you go a-swinging, son.
0470	They ain't gonna hang me.
0471	Well, nevertheless, one day your name will be called.
0472	And on that day, you must answer.
0473	I know it.
0474	Yeah? What are you gonna say? I did the best I could in a bad time.
0475	Now, see, I understand that better than you know, but it won't be good enough for him.
0476	So, all you got to do is get down on your knees Yeah.
0477	I seen plenty of men get down on their knees and call out his name in terrible times.
0478	I seen their prayers answered with a bullet more often than not.
0479	It's hard to comprehend, I Son, I know.
0480	It's impossible sometimes, but But he is here, and his mercy knows no bounds.
0481	So just bend them knees and ask for forgiveness.
0482	No, sir.
0483	I won't do it.
0484	Because the war took your faith? Because I don't deserve forgiveness.
0485	Oi! We can't use that.
0486	Ma would understand.
0487	And what about next week and the week after? This ain't gonna stop.
0488	There's nothing we can do about this bastard.
0489	That's what you said in Boston.
0490	I thought you said we were never to speak of that.
0491	I got us out of that, I'll get us out of this.
0492	But how? I don't know yet.
0493	We'll figure something.
0494	One day we'll send this to Ma and it'll be as thick as a brick.
0495	My hand to God.
0496	I had some jackrabbit in me, too.
0497	Master gave me a nice pair of bracelets to sleep in.
0498	Somebody put you in chains, the natural thing to do is try to escape.
0499	Ain't I right? Ain't I right? Yeah.
0500	You're right.
0501	Let's go.
0502	They're coming.
0503	You gonna make a run for it? I ain't leaving.
0504	They'll find you.
0505	Not where I'm going.
0506	So, it's true.
0507	Mmm-hmm.
0508	All of them? Everyone but the woman.
0509	Them Injuns get her? I don't know.
0510	Put the word out, $100 reward for anyone who finds her.
0511	But not a word about the maps.
0512	Yeah.
0513	Mr Durant.
0514	Who the hell are you? Cullen Bohannon, the man they're looking to hang.
0515	For killing Johnson? I suppose you're here to tell me you're innocent? No, sir.
0516	I'm here to ask for his job.
0517	How do you put your trousers on, son? Sir? Over those big balls of yours? Two minutes.
0518	That's all I ask.
0519	Two minutes.
0520	Did you fight in the war, Mr Durant? I served my country in other ways.
0521	Well, building this railroad ain't much different than the war.
0522	You got an army out there, and they need a leader.
0523	I take it you fought for the South, Mr Bohannon.
0524	Yes, sir.
0525	And that's exactly why you need to hire me.
0526	You're going to have to explain that to me.
0527	I can't remember a time I wasn't outgunned, outmanned, or out-supplied fighting you Yankees, but I damn sure whooped your asses more often than not.
0528	:: Is that so? - Yes, sir.
0529	My men rode to hell and back for me, Mr Durant.
0530	That's why you need me out here.
0531	What do you know about building railroads? Well, I had to learn how they was built so I could figure out best how to blow them up.
0532	You remember the Baltimore and Ohio Bridge over the Monocacy River? I built that bridge before the war.
0533	I blew the whole thing up using half a keg of black powder.
0534	But I'm done destroying things, Mr Durant.
0535	I want to help you build this railroad.
0536	Why should I trust my railroad to a grayback? You didn't have too much trouble trusting graybacks when you was smuggling cotton out of Mississippi during the war, now did you? You walk a fine line, son.
0537	Forty miles, Mr Durant.
0538	Ain't no secret you got to lay 40 miles of usable track before your government money kicks in.
0539	Now, you and I both know that you ain't gonna get there going at this rate.
0540	You don't get that $16,000 a mile, this whole thing goes belly up.
0541	You're fighting a war, Mr Durant.
0542	No doubt about it.
0543	You need me to help you win it.
0544	Son of a bitch.
0545	What the hell are you doing, man? He's the son of a bitch who killed Johnson.
0546	We gonna hang him.
0547	Nonsense.
0548	This is my new foreman.
0549	Find me someone else to hang.
0550	You're the new foreman? Yeah.
0551	Johnson's things still in there? Yeah.
0552	You want me to clear it out? Leave it.
0553	Yes, sir.
0554	Good morning, sinners.
0555	I can say that because I'm a sinner, too.
0556	I know the dark path of drink and debauchery.
0557	I traveled it well.
0558	Yeah, but now I'm on the path to God's light.
0559	And I invite every last one of you to come along.
0560	All are welcome.
0561	Black, white, sinner or saint.
0562	Even you papists.
0563	All are welcome in God's house.
0564	Thank you, Father.
0565	I mean, Reverend.
0566	I'm glad our dear, sweet mother wasn't here to see that.
0567	What? Just being polite.
0568	Why you always on me ass? The house was half full last night.
0569	Be half again tomorrow.
0570	What do you want me to do about it? Worry about it.
0571	Like I do.
0572	The Swede will come calling, you know, sooner rather than later.
0573	That must be the new girl.
0574	The savage one.
0575	- What do you mean? - Haven't you heard? Mr Toole told me the whole story.
0576	She was but a girl, white as we, taken captive years ago.
0577	Sold to the highest heathen bidder, she was.
0578	Some say she was a slave.
0579	Others claim she be an Indian princess.
0580	Will you stop with your tall tales? She's just a whore, Mick.
0581	Well, then go talk to her, you bastard.
0582	Make me a liar.
0583	Go on.
0584	Good morning to ya.
0585	He buy the man a drink first, that's what I hear.
0586	He buy the man a drink, take him out and goes savage as a meat axe on him, you hear me? He didn't kill Johnson.
0587	They was gonna hang him.
0588	They didn't.
0589	Yet.
0590	Good day, Mr Bohannon, sir.
0591	A fine day, is it not? Fine or not.
0592	Guess we got a good day's work ahead of us.
0593	Mr Kretschmar.
0594	I need that rail end leveled down to the next marker.
0595	Mr Toole, I need you and your men down at the end of the iron.
0596	Looks like the train's bringing down that load of ties, all right? Yes, sir, Mr Bohannon, sir.
0597	Elam, - I need you and your men - It's Mr Ferguson.
0598	Elam.
0599	You and your men get down in the cut.
0600	I need men.
0601	Men not afraid of the heathens, men not afraid of making some money.
0602	What is this about? The fair-haired maiden of the west.
0603	Mrs Lily Bell, she has been taken captive by the Cheyenne dog soldiers.
0604	A Mr Durant has promised a bounty to the men who rescue her.
0605	Ain't nobody going nowheres.
0606	Or there won't be a job waiting for you when you get back.
0607	Dix will take a party north, Bolan, south.
0608	You.
0609	:: You.
0610	:: Yeah.
0611	:: You.
0612	:: I told You.
0613	I can't spare these men.
0614	Mr Durant wants her found.
0615	Mr Durant wants a railroad built.
0616	You and you.
0617	No, this ain't happening.
0618	Boss man, let 'em go.
0619	We can do their work and our work.
0620	You get your men and you get the hell out of here.
0621	One more thing.
0622	I'm looking for a man named Harper, Frank Harper.
0623	He's a friend of Johnson's.
0624	I got something for him.
0625	I believe he's out with the logging crew.
0626	Where's that? Well, it must be 15, 20 miles west of the cut by now.
0627	Is that a bullet? What? What you got for Sergeant Harper? Ain't you got some work to do? Yours and theirs? Get to it.
0628	The people, they are scared.
0629	The Indian massacre.
0630	They seen the bodies, heard the stories.
0631	Your stories.
0632	I need troops.
0633	Seven men we lost last night.
0634	Left the employ of the Union Pacific, some on the train, others just ran off.
0635	More tonight, I expect.
0636	Seems the men prefer to keep their scalps on their heads.
0637	Are you afraid? - No, sir, Mr - What about you? - Well, as a matter of fact, I - Enough.
0638	Now, why do you wanna shit on my railroad? Well, under our current pace, we won't make the 40-mile mark.
0639	So, what I would propose is we straighten the route.
0640	The route remains the same.
0641	But, Mr Durant, as I understand it, the deadline has been pushed up.
0642	And in light of Central Pacific's recent advances Keep to the plan.
0643	I'll make it a reality.
0644	Yes, sir, Mr Durant.
0645	You're amused? No, sir.
0646	I'm just looking forward to watching, yet again, as you smite the forces agin you.
0647	The search continues? For the maps? Yeah.
0648	For the woman, Lily Bell.
0649	I've got my men out despite Mr Bohannon.
0650	Still more concerned about your killer than my railroad? No, sir.
0651	But whoever cut Daniel Johnson's throat is an ongoing concern.
0652	More importantly, is my new foreman building my railroad? He is.
0653	Yet there is something about the man that does not quite add up.
0654	To, Jordan Crane, Washington, DC.
0655	Stop.
0656	Honorable Senator, work continues at a fever pace.
0657	Stop.
0658	However, hostile Native action threatens progress.
0659	Stop.
0660	The march of civilization in jeopardy.
0661	Stop.
0662	To heal the nation, we must displace the savage.
0663	Stop.
0664	Otherwise, the savage will displace us.
0665	Mrs Bell? Mrs Bell? Whoa, boy.
0666	You speak English? Yes, sir.
0667	Move.
0668	Who are you? Joseph Black Moon.
0669	You Cheyenne? Christian.
0670	Whoa, whoa.
0671	Hold steady.
0672	I'm unarmed, sir.
0673	What did you do to her? - I I didn't do - Hey.
0674	Hey.
0675	What did you do to her? I saved her.
0676	From the Indians? Yes, sir.
0677	She took an arrow to the shoulder.
0678	I'm trying to take her to the railroad to see the doctor.
0679	When this happen? Two, maybe three days ago.
0680	All right.
0681	My horse, there's a field kit in the saddle bag.
0682	Here.
0683	Hold her down.
0684	Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hold her down.
0685	Hey, stop! Stop it! Hold on.
0686	Now, the man say we gotta do our work and theirs.
0687	But I ask ya, why ain't that Negro ass down here with us? Y'all know who he is, that's all I'm saying.
0688	Back in the day Them days was bad.
0689	Don't get me wrong.
0690	Massah drove me hard.
0691	Nearly drove me to the grave.
0692	You hear me? Some things was better back then.
0693	:: At least you knew your place.
0694	:: Psalms!Less talk, more work.
0695	Bust me some stone, Negro.
0696	How 'bout I bust me your head? You got something to say to me? Yes, I do.
0697	What would that be? How come we got to do the white man work, huh? Oh, that's right, 'cause you think you is the white man, not the high yeller house nigger you is.
0698	We got to do their work and our work.
0699	But this ain't for them.
0700	This is for us.
0701	White man ain't gonna give you nothing, because they want us to fall.
0702	They all want us to fall.
0703	Hey.
0704	Sir? Are you leaving? Yeah.
0705	Somewheres I gotta be.
0706	Thank you for helping her.
0707	Yep.
0708	Whoa.
0709	Damn it.
0710	You ain't thought this thing through, have you? What do you mean? Indian brings that woman back to town, Indian don't get out alive.
0711	But I live there, at the church.
0712	You don't get it, do ya, boy? They brought them back in yesterday on a buckboard.
0713	Everybody's seen what they did to them bodies.
0714	Why cut 'em up? Huh? What do you people get out of it? Your people have done much worse.
0715	Yeah, maybe.
0716	Maybe.
0717	But that ain't gonna keep 'em from skinning your ass alive, you bring that white woman back to town.
0718	I'll have to take her.
0719	Explain to me how I work harder than them, and they go to bed with three more dollars in their pocket than I do.
0720	That don't make a lick of sense.
0721	Well, it don't.
0722	We work as hard as them, right? Damn right.
0723	Then why don't we get the same reward? You crazy.
0724	We deserve a taste, too.
0725	Huh? We can't go in there.
0726	You ain't one of them nancy boys, is you, Psalms? Now, I know you get horny, I hear you back behind that tent every night.
0727	Damn, boy, you gonna go blind.
0728	Lookee here.
0729	You go in there, you coming out on the bad end of a rope.
0730	You ain't scared, is ya? You're damn right I'm scared.
0731	Well, I ain't.
0732	She had a face like a hatchet and an ass like a Venus, I tell you.
0733	Just what do you want, you mule-colored bastard? Spend some hard-earned money, same as you.
0734	Same as me, he says.
0735	Have you looked in the mirror lately, Mr Ferguson? You think we the same, well, then, you got a big surprise coming, I tell you.
0736	Face like a coal scuttle, he has.
0737	Why don't you just mind your damn business? You the man to make me? Well, if it ain't Mr Toole.
0738	Watch out, ladies, he's back.
0739	We call him  The Blade,  for he'll gut you like a trout.
0740	And who would you be? Your next customer.
0741	Look at him, can't even land a cheap-ass whore been plowed by every heathen buck in the territory.
0742	Is this what you're looking for? My shoulder's feeling much better.
0743	Where's Joseph? He took off.
0744	Why? Ma'am, it is way too late and way too wet to be trying to figure out some Indian, all right? I regret we haven't been properly introduced.
0745	Cullen Bohannon.
0746	I work for the railroad.
0747	Have I done something? It ain't what you done.
0748	It's who you are.
0749	What do you mean? You ain't whore nor squaw.
0750	You shouldn't be out here.
0751	You don't know who I am, or what I'm capable of.
0752	No, I don't, and I sure as hell don't care.
0753	Request for military support to be taken under advisement.
0754	Very concerned regarding lack of progress.
0755	Need to understand impact of surveyor loss.
0756	The Honorable Senator is very concerned.
0757	If he were in my shoes, he'd be downright suicidal.
0758	Ah! Damn.
0759	Henri? Your look of disdain reminds me of my dear wife back in New York.
0760	What Hannah failed to grasp is that where most men seek the warm glow that only whiskey can provide, I imbibe to fuel a conflagration.
0761	There's a fire in my belly which must be fed.
0762	Otherwise, we'll never see the Pacific.
0763	And did your wife accept this excuse, Monsieur Durant? As a matter of fact, she didn't.
0764	Sorry, mate.
0765	You missed the last show, I'm afraid.
0766	Oh! Very well.
0767	I see.
0768	Mr Durant, sir, an honor and a pleasure.
0769	This is quite an establishment you've got here.
0770	I'm only sorry you're closed for the night.
0771	Next show begins at dusk tomorrow.
0772	Quiet, you daft bastard.
0773	This is Thomas  Doc  Durant.
0774	A private view he'll be having.
0775	Thank you.
0776	:: How much? - that will be five Dollars.
0777	The going rate for a private show.
0778	Mickey, show time! I have followed your exploits and investments since I got off the boat.
0779	How you rose up from nothing, pulled yourself up by your bootstraps.
0780	You're a gentleman and a true capitalist.
0781	Thank you.
0782	Hmm.
0783	I assume you two are immigrants from this beautiful country? Aye.
0784	From County Wicklow, to be exact.
0785	We left our sweet mother and four brothers and set out for the new world to seek our fortune.
0786	You left a beautiful life to come and wallow in this filth and squalor and muck.
0787	Well, it beats starving to death.
0788	No, but you could have remained in New York or Boston or Chicago.
0789	There's plenty of work to be had.
0790	Yet you chose to come here.
0791	Makes me wonder why.
0792	I'm not quite sure what you mean, sir.
0793	Well, you and thousands like you have followed me out here and I'm genuinely curious.
0794	Why? Well, sir It seemed a proper investment of our time and efforts.
0795	MICKEY: That's not it at all.
0796	I remember it well.
0797	Like it was yesterday.
0798	What are you talking about? What is it you remember? We were just lads, me and Sean, never been much further afield than the bit of land our father worked, God rest him.
0799	And one day, we heard the whistle, and it was the Dublin special on its daily run.
0800	Well, we jumped the steaming bastard.
0801	It took us all the way to the city.
0802	Yes, I remember.
0803	I never felt so free.
0804	The railroad gave you freedom.
0805	Aye.
0806	And our father gave us the whipping of a lifetime.
0807	I prayed you'd stay away, my son.
0808	This is my home.
0809	Not a very safe one right now for one born out of the grace of God.
0810	But I'm baptized, Father.
0811	Yeah, well, that does not always sway the cruel prejudice of others.
0812	It's not your fault.
0813	But it is.
0814	They were from my band.
0815	Our dog soldiers, they're the ones that did this.
0816	Your family had nothing to do with this.
0817	I recognized the arrows, Father.
0818	It was my brother.
0819	You must tell no one.
0820	Never speak of this again.
0821	But it's the truth.
0822	Never.
0823	Well, there you are, kitty cat.
0824	What do you want? We want you.
0825	We've been searching over hill and dale for the fair-haired maiden of the west.
0826	We've come to rescue ya.
0827	Thank you, no.
0828	I'm quite all right.
0829	No, you ain't.
0830	You barely escaped massacre.
0831	You've been held captive.
0832	You've been sullied by the heathen.
0833	You're out of order, sir.
0834	Listen, you ain't come with us, we ain't get compensated.
0835	Yeah, there's a bounty on your head now, Go ahead.
0836	Easy now, girl.
0837	:: you just take it easy.
0838	:: Stay back.
0839	:: Easy now.
0840	- Stay back! Now, you're making this a lot more unpleasant than it has to be.
0841	Miss Bell! Damn it.
0842	Come on! My ear! My ear! My ear! Where is it? Whoa.
0843	Whoa, hold up there.
0844	Death's no stranger to this godforsaken place.
0845	Death abides in the hard labor of a rail gang, or the searing heat of a prairie fire.
0846	Death abides at the bottom of a whiskey bottle or the smoking end of a gun.
0847	There's death by famine, flood or pestilence and a thousand other ways.
0848	But, yes, brothers, death abides and he will reap his dark harvest.
0849	But must we be death's accomplice? Must we do his bidding? I know that your hearts seek vengeance for the deaths of those men, I know that, but haven't we had our fill of war? Our fill of killing? Shedding of blood?  And they will hammer their swords into plowshares.
0850	And their spears into pruning hooks.
0851	Nations will not lift up swords against nation.
0852	And never again will they learn war.
0853	Never again.
0854	It's Isaiah 2:4.
0855	Wake up the mighty men,  let all the men of war draw near.
0856	Hammer your plowshares into swords.
0857	And your pruning hooks into spears.
0858	Joel 3: 10.
0859	I, too, am sick of war, Reverend.
0860	But we must consistently ask ourselves,  What is worth fighting for?  What is worth laying our lives on the line for? Robert Bell gave his life for this undertaking, this grand idea, and I assure you, he did not give his life in vain.
0861	For he knew what this railroad would mean to us as a nation.
0862	He knew this railroad is a new birth of freedom.
0863	Not just the freedom of long-distance travel, but the freedom to choose your fate, the freedom to make your fortunes in this untamed land.
0864	And we cannot let that freedom be threatened by ragtag bands of marauding Stone Age primitives.
0865	But that is not to say that there is not a peaceful solution.
0866	If they will put down their sticks and stones and come into the fold, like this young man here, then we will talk peace.
0867	Now, look at him, wearing our clothes, speaking our language, washed in the blood of our savior.
0868	If these violent nomads roaming the plains are willing to do as he has done, then there is very real hope that our mission might be accomplished peacefully.
0869	If not, then they are the authors of their own destruction.
0870	LILY: It's been months since I've seen such a Shit hole? Whoa.
0871	Will you be all right from here? You're not taking me in? There's a church and the doctor straight on up ahead.
0872	Wait.
0873	What about the bounty? I told ya, I got business to attend to, Cheyenne territory.
0874	About four hours of daylight left, gotta move.
0875	Mr Bohannon?
0876	Anybody there? Drop the rifle.
0877	Turn around.
0878	:: you Harper? - No, sir.
0879	Where is he? Who wants to know? I'm your new foreman.
0880	Why should I believe you? I guess Mr Durant didn't have time to come out and tell you his self.
0881	Durant? - Yeah, he told me to come look for Harper.
0882	- Why? That's his business.
0883	Where is he? Harper hightailed it.
0884	:: When? - a few hours ago.
0885	:: Which way? - North.
0886	Towards the ridge.
0887	- Is it true about Johnson? - Yeah, it's true.
0888	What's the world coming to, sir? The world ain't coming to nothing, son.
0889	Same as it ever was.
0890	Harper! Harper! Is that you? Whoa! Shit.
0891	Mrs Bell? Mrs Bell, it's me, Thomas Durant.
0892	They said you were up here.
0893	I know who you are, Mr Durant.
0894	The whole world's been looking for you and here you are.
0895	And here I am.
0896	You must excuse my appearance.
0897	We need to get you some medical attention.
0898	Please, allow me to escort you.
0899	You You won't need this anymore.
0900	Your ordeal is over.
0901	My deepest condolences on your loss, Mrs Bell.
0902	Thank you.
0903	How in God's name did you make your way back here? Oh.
0904	Can't remember his name A Southerner, I think.
0905	:: Bohannon? - Yes, I believe so.
0906	Did I tell ya about me rendezvous with the tattooed harlot? The scarlet whore of Babylon had nothing on this lass, I tell ya.
0907	Give us the particulars, man.
0908	I have never seen nothing like it in all me life, boys.
0909	She used her organ like a velvet hand on me tallywhacker.
0910	And to hear her tell it, she's practiced these dark arts of love on all manner of beasts and men.
0911	Chinks, monkeys and horses have all known the pleasure of her touch.
0912	In fact, there is but one creature in all the world with whom she refuses to copulate.
0913	And what would that be? Well, the common American nigger, of course.
0914	- Damn it, I've heard enough - Hey, hey, hey, hey! All right.
0915	Never thought I'd see you again.
0916	You kill him? Where you going? Sooner or later, you gotta give us some orders, boss man.
0917	The demise of Head Surveyor Robert Bell and party a great loss to railroad.
0918	Stop.
0919	Bell's work must continue.
0920	Stop.
0921	Send funds for new surveyors at once.
0922	Stop.
0923	What news? Payroll is late.
0924	Work disorganized and slow.
0925	This new foreman of yours just up and leave yesterday.
0926	Nobody seen him since.
0927	He rode out to rendezvous with a tree-cutting party.
0928	He informed me yesterday at our morning briefing.
0929	There is something about this man.
0930	He's up to something.
0931	:: He crossed paths with Mrs Bell.
0932	:: Bohannon? He brought her in.
0933	- Did she have the maps? - Shh! She's right next door.
0934	She didn't have them.
0935	How do we reach the Pacific without them? You let me worry about that.
0936	Oh! There's a supply train arriving tomorrow morning with a shipment of black powder.
0937	My men will meet the train and guard it all morning.
0938	New telegram, to my damn stock broker.
0939	Invest $147,000 in R&R Railroad stock as discussed.
0940	Stop.
0941	Mrs Bell? Are you all right in there? Yes, thank you, Mr Durant.
0942	I I brought out my Personal chef from Delmonico's in New York City.
0943	I wondered if you would like to join me for dinner this evening? Yes, that would be wonderful.
0944	Is there anything else I can get for you? Actually, has the reward been given to anyone? I believe it belongs to Mr Bohannon.
0945	I don't think he's claimed it.
0946	:: Would you like me to see that He gets it? - No.
0947	There's someone else who deserves it.
0948	Stay off my corner, sweetheart.
0949	Unless she wants her own crib, right, ladies? You leave her alone.
0950	What do you say, blondie? Them Injuns teach you anything? Mind that mouth! Hey, I'm sorry, ma'am.
0951	These dirty whores don't know a lady when they see one.
0952	Where there is hatred, let me show love.
0953	Where there is injury, pardon.
0954	Where there is doubt, faith.
0955	Amen.
0956	:: Joseph? - Mrs Bell.
0957	You look like you're feeling much better.
0958	It's amazing what a little soap and water can do.
0959	I didn't mean to leave that night.
0960	:: but that man - No.
0961	There's no need to explain.
0962	- You've cut your hair.
0963	- Yes, ma'am.
0964	:: Did you come to pray? - No, I came to give you this.
0965	It's the reward money.
0966	No, please, take it.
0967	I can't.
0968	There'll be no trouble, nobody knows it was you.
0969	No, that's not it.
0970	I'm not a bounty hunter.
0971	- It's my duty to help.
0972	:: Joseph, that money will buy a lot of Bibles.
0973	Mrs Bell, Reverend Cole.
0974	:: Reverend.
0975	:: your donations are always welcome.
0976	Please.
0977	Thank you.
0978	So, this is the fair-haired maiden of the West? I beg your pardon?  Robert Bell fought valiantly to save the virtue of his beautiful wife,  killing a savage with his final breath.
0979	:: Is that not How it happened? - Yes.
0980	My husband saved my life.
0981	Well, what about the rest of it? Outnumbered 10-to-one? - Sullied by the savages? - I didn't write it.
0982	:: Right, but Is this true? - of course not.
0983	Well, Indians will die as a result of this.
0984	The Indians attacked us.
0985	If they die, they will be to blame, not me.
0986	Maybe you've heard of the Sand Creek Massacre? I didn't come here to speak of this.
0987	You know, the Cheyenne were flying the American flag over their camp and it didn't stop the U.
0988	S.
0989	Calvary from killing 100 innocent women and children.
0990	It's a terrible thing that happened.
0991	I wasn't a part of it.
0992	No, no, please, I'm just saying, try to see the bigger picture.
0993	My husband was slaughtered right in front of me.
0994	It's a little difficult to see the bigger picture.
0995	Good day.
0996	Hey.
0997	Hey.
0998	Hey! That sumbitch got away because of you.
0999	Cause of me? How you figure that? You killed Johnson before he could give me Harper's name.
1000	:: What? - I killed Johnson before He killed You.
1001	No.
1002	And I would have got a name out of him.
1003	And he would have blowed your brains out.
1004	And then I could have killed Harper before he had a chance to run.
1005	You're either drunk or crazy or both.
1006	You have any idea what they took from me? They ain't took nothing from you that ain't been took from me.
1007	Fly away home, just a nickel a show.
1008	Feel the mist against your cheeks.
1009	Give it a rest, Mick.
1010	They're sick and bloody tired of the mighty Shannon and the Blarney Stone.
1011	The bloody Irish bog.
1012	:: Well, then we need new slides.
1013	:: new slides cost money.
1014	You've got some copper squirreled away, Brother, now's the time to tell me.
1015	Maybe we should relocate.
1016	The rent is low down by the slaughterhouse, right? The rent was low in Wicklow, too, Mick.
1017	Ah! We're done with that shite.
1018	Twas a high-rent dream that brought us out here.
1019	I'm not going to let that big Swedish bastard kill our dream.
1020	Am I right? Mick? MICKEY: Hold on now.
1021	I just had a grand idea.
1022	:: Oh, No.
1023	- It's a business idea.
1024	Ideas ain't your strong suit, Mick.
1025	This one's golden.
1026	I'll prove it to ya.
1027	I've taken the liberty of telegraphing your family in England.
1028	:: I just wanted them to know you were well.
1029	:: Thank you, Mr Durant.
1030	I'm afraid you'll grow weary of my gratitude.
1031	I don't know what news of the attack may have reached them.
1032	I didn't want your father worrying needlessly.
1033	I'm sure my father was happy to hear he was right.
1034	About me coming to America.
1035	He was against it, no doubt? My father had every aspect of my life planned out, including whom I should marry.
1036	Robert interrupted those plans.
1037	I saw him give a lecture at the British Museum of Natural History.
1038	He spoke of the American West.
1039	I fell in love.
1040	With him and with this land.
1041	I, too, came under Robert's spell.
1042	His dream of a transcontinental railroad became my own.
1043	Then it's a shame you two had such a terrible falling out.
1044	Well, Robert and I didn't see eye to eye on everything.
1045	Such as how to squeeze every last dollar out of the railroad.
1046	Mrs Bell, your husband was a starry-eyed dreamer.
1047	I am a realist.
1048	Without me, his dream would have remained just that.
1049	Thank you for your hospitality, Mr Durant.
1050	Mrs Bell, please, I'm sorry.
1051	I didn't mean to impugn Robert.
1052	Yes, he needed me, but I needed him also.
1053	Our marriage wasn't perfect, but it worked.
1054	Mrs Bell, there's nowhere for you to go out there.
1055	Please, accept my apology.
1056	Do me the honor of remaining my guest.
1057	Why you following me? You trying to get me killed? Mister, you do that all by yourself busting in on a white cathouse.
1058	What you want then? Huh? You still want to give me a roll? I thought you were mighty clear on where you stood on that.
1059	Honey, I'm already a cut-rate whore on account of my beauty marks.
1060	My white customers know I laid with a colored fella, I starve.
1061	But, if you got a dollar, then maybe we can do one off the books.
1062	Now you trying to get us both killed.
1063	Look at him.
1064	Drop your hanky Madam? Now, now, boys.
1065	I doubt Mr Durant wants his new foreman assassinated.
1066	He shot my dang ear off, Swede.
1067	Too bad it was not your tongue.
1068	Move aside.
1069	Mr Bolan, you need to leave here, right now.
1070	Damn it.
1071	Come on, Tommy, let's go.
1072	Let's go.
1073	Come on.
1074	Magnolias, they grow just outside the gates of the Andersonville.
1075	Some nights, their perfume was almost enough to mask the awful stench.
1076	You're a difficult man to cipher, Mr Bohannon.
1077	Let me buy you a drink.
1078	I won't turn down free liquor.
1079	:: need another glass.
1080	:: Thank You.
1081	No.
1082	I know you killed Johnson.
1083	What I do not know yet is why.
1084	Who are you? Hmm? Ah! I'll figure it out.
1085	You let me know when you do, all right? Oh, by golly, you will be the first to know.
1086	Hmm? But in the meantime, I've got a A business proposition for you.
1087	Now, there is a There is some black powder coming in on the train tomorrow morning.
1088	That is your cut.
1089	And you just look the other way while my boys unload Well, a few barrels.
1090	Is that some of that immoral mathematics, Mr Swede? Huh? All right.
1091	:: you got a deal.
1092	:: Yeah.
1093	For another five.
1094	Hmm.
1095	Oh! Well, well, well.
1096	Look here.
1097	How them Injuns treat you? Well, they were people.
1098	You know what people are like.
1099	Some of them are good and some of them ain't so good.
1100	What about the ones that put that mark on you? Well, this wasn't that bad.
1101	:: Did it hurt? - not as much as a lot of things.
1102	Folk be telling all kind of tales about what that mean.
1103	Well, what do you think it means? I reckon it mean you was a slave, just like me.
1104	It's three blankets and a horse.
1105	That's what I was worth to them.
1106	Them eyes of yours alone worth 100 horses.
1107	They was fools.
1108	Maybe there's another way of looking at it.
1109	Maybe this mark was their way of giving me their name, telling the world that I was one of them.
1110	Hmm.
1111	I got my master name, too, but I sure as hell ain't one of them.
1112	Best I can tell, you ain't one of nobody or nothing.
1113	Just like you? We're like two peas in a pod, huh? Forty miles, 40 miles.
1114	Who came up with that number? It's completely arbitrary.
1115	I don't have enough to worry about with the savages and the cutthroats I have working for me.
1116	It must be hard to be you.
1117	Those milksops in Washington, I beg them for more troops, but get none.
1118	And my investors, do you think they'll give me even a penny for new surveyors? Mmm.
1119	They haven't got your guts, Thomas.
1120	Robert was a lucky man to have you at his side.
1121	Thomas, are the new surveyors to finish Robert's work? Yes, this time.
1122	Forgive me.
1123	I thought the lion's share of Robert's work was finished.
1124	Yes, it was, but he still owed me some surveys.
1125	I think he was keeping them from me because of our falling out.
1126	I see.
1127	What kind of surveys? There.
1128	LILY: The Rocky Mountains? It's a 14,000-foot barrier of stone and snow.
1129	But I think Robert knew the way through.
1130	But when you didn't have his maps, I Oh You poor man.
1131	You must have been crushed.
1132	I was.
1133	That's not to say I wasn't elated to see you safe and sound.
1134	Let's have a song, shall we? Henri? Dark night here in Hell, brothers and sisters.
1135	Come on in.
1136	I got eggs, I got coffee, I got scripture.
1137	Oh, Mr Bohannon.
1138	Hi, Mr Bohannon.
1139	Did the good Lord save you from hanging so you could drown yourself in whiskey? It's a little late for proselytizing, ain't it, Preacher? You know, you were right.
1140	You know, you don't deserve forgiveness.
1141	:: Yeah.
1142	:: Neither Did I.
1143	Yet I I stand here, my wickedness washed away by the blood of the Lamb.
1144	The hell you know about wickedness? You ever hear of Bleeding Kansas? You know, I rode with martyr John Brown.
1145	John Brown was a cold-blooded killer.
1146	You in a position to throw stones on that account, Mr Bohannon? That's right.
1147	Cause, you know, one night, you authored the deaths of five men.
1148	Slave owners.
1149	We pulled them from their homes and butchered them with broadswords.
1150	You know, drunkard I was, I I neglected to put an edge on On my blade.
1151	It was hard work, brother, but I I kept a-hacking and a-hacking and a-hacking till I couldn't hack no more.
1152	Now, that's Bleeding Kansas.
1153	Why didn't you just shoot them? The mercy of a bullet was something they didn't deserve.
1154	Well, I owned slaves.
1155	Yeah, well, lucky for you you weren't in Kansas that night.
1156	No, Preacher.
1157	It's lucky for you.
1158	No one deserves forgiveness, brother.
1159	That's the beauty of grace.
1160	Yeah.
1161	I thank you for the sermon, Preacher.
1162	I used to be a lot like you, Cullen.
1163	The only difference was I had a cause.
1164	What is yours? Yeah, John Brown's dead.
1165	That's right.
1166	Yeah, I believe we hung his sorry ass.
1167	# I wish I was in the land of cotton # Old times there are not forgotten # Look away, look away # Look away, Dixie Land.
1168	Careful with this stuff, boys.
1169	Hey.
1170	You got a brick in your hat this morning, boss man? That hill we coming up on don't meet grade.
1171	We either gotta blow it or go around.
1172	Blow it.
1173	My men ain't never handled that black powder.
1174	It ain't my problem.
1175	You ain't no better than Johnson, you know that? How come every time I turn around, you're knee deep in my business? 'Cause you the boss.
1176	I want to keep my job.
1177	You better get to work, then.
1178	You got men ready to work but there ain't no supplies or no foreman.
1179	You got to get up off your ass and get out there.
1180	The black powder is on the damn supply train.
1181	I ain't your master.
1182	You wanted freedom, you got it.
1183	Figure it out your damn self.
1184	Mick, where the hell you been? Makin' us some money, Sean-O.
1185	Right this way, lads.
1186	You won't be disappointed, I promise.
1187	Hey, hey, hey.
1188	No shoving.
1189	One at a time.
1190	Everyone will get his turn now.
1191	Right.
1192	Go on.
1193	What do you see? Are ya daft, Mick? What? It's brilliant.
1194	It's a nickel a peep, the show's always changing and there's no need for new slides.
1195	You know, there's a lot of uncontrollable factors.
1196	Hey, hey! This ain't no peep show.
1197	Get out of here, you hobos and you coal crunchers.
1198	You pay your $3 like everyone else! - Jesus.
1199	- Get! How's about a kiss for us instead? How's about you kiss my whore ass, you thick Irish bogtrotter! Get! Good morning.
1200	I trust you had a decent night's sleep? This is the first bed I've slept in in a long time.
1201	I'm sorry for my behavior last night.
1202	- I'm afraid I had too much to drink.
1203	- Oh, please don't apologize.
1204	I enjoyed myself immensely.
1205	And today I was hoping to see more of your railroad, what you've accomplished, what lies ahead.
1206	After all, your passion for this great enterprise was an inspiration.
1207	Well, in that case, you shall have the grand tour, my dear.
1208	That is, if you're well enough to ride.
1209	I believe Fall back.
1210	Let's go! Run, Bolan, run! Move, move, move! Go bloody away! Get out of there! - Oh, shit.
1211	:: Shut the hell up.
1212	They're gonna blow! Ah! My leg! - My leg.
1213	:: Quit your crying, madam.
1214	Get the hell out of there! Come on, lads, pull it up.
1215	Pick it up.
1216	Pick it up.
1217	Another bucket.
1218	Another bucket.
1219	That's the way, lads.
1220	Keep going.
1221	Careful now.
1222	Hold his head.
1223	May I? Lift the arm, put pressure on the vein.
1224	:: There? Or here? - Up higher.
1225	Right there.
1226	:: you got it? - I think so.
1227	All right.
1228	I gotta go.
1229	Stay with him.
1230	All right! That's enough lollygagging around.
1231	Rail crew better be hammering rail by the time I get to my horse! Cut crew out to the cut! Let's go! We got a hill to blow, boys.
1232	Back to work!.
1233	It is good to make this sacrifice where the sun can look down and see you.
1234	It is a great privilege to dance with the sun.
1235	The sacrifice will be hard, but you are strong and brave.
1236	You will not give up, as I did not give up when my father brought me to this place.
1237	Follow the sun all day and pray.
1238	If you are strong and true, your sacrifice will be rewarded and you will have a vision.
1239	Mighty fine job, Mr Bohannon.
1240	Ahem.
1241	Ma'am.
1242	It's not your manners, Mr Bohannon.
1243	It's your manner.
1244	Beg your pardon? Yesterday, when everyone was running from the disaster, you walked calmly in.
1245	You are their hero, Mr Bohannon.
1246	Lily! I just heard from your father.
1247	Everything is arranged.
1248	I'm assuming you're here to see me? Yes, sir.
1249	Payroll didn't come in on the train this morning.
1250	Mr Bohannon, one of the reasons I spared your neck was because I thought you were a capable man.
1251	Was I mistaken? No, sir, but the men are already grumbling about not getting their pay last week, sir.
1252	Yes, well, see the Swede about petty cash.
1253	Mr Durant, that won't cover the men's pay.
1254	Of course not, you idiot.
1255	It's for the walking bosses.
1256	But keep quiet about it.
1257	We don't want a riot on our hands.
1258	So keep the men in line until you get your money trouble sorted out.
1259	My problems are no concern of yours, Mr Bohannon.
1260	Actually, today, Mr Durant, your troubles are mine.
1261	But y'all go have yourselves a nice picnic, all right? Reverend? I can find someone else to help with this.
1262	Just a moment to catch my breath.
1263	Get the hell out of the way.
1264	We need to ride out and speak to Many Horses immediately.
1265	My father's people won't feel threatened by four men.
1266	Well, these men are the eyes of the Union Army.
1267	The tip of the spear.
1268	Let's go.
1269	Business has been slow, Mr Swede.
1270	We will pay you though.
1271	:: Yeah.
1272	:: we just need a little more time.
1273	Well, thank you, gentlemen.
1274	Thank you for telling me that you are unable to pay what is owed.
1275	I shall give you a little more time.
1276	See, I told you Mr Swede was a reasonable man.
1277	Yeah.
1278	No, you didn't.
1279	He just took one of our slides.
1280	Are you sure we can find him? Yes.
1281	But they're not going to be happy to see us.
1282	Why is that? These rituals, they're not meant for white man's eyes.
1283	Father? Father? It's Ruth.
1284	Your daughter.
1285	What are you doing here? Mother died.
1286	I came to find you.
1287	Well, we'll send you to the mission in Council Bluffs.
1288	They'll take care of you.
1289	:: the mission sent me here, they said - Yea.
1290	You're not staying here.
1291	I have nowhere else to go.
1292	She can stay in the church tent.
1293	At least till we get back.
1294	I'll decide where you go when we return.
1295	In the meantime, there's a bed in the back.
1296	Thank you, Father.
1297	How long has it been since you've seen her? Twelve, fifteen years.
1298	I don't exactly recollect.
1299	And you're just going to leave her here? In a place like this? You're right.
1300	There are some things I need to tell you.
1301	There's Bacon in the bear box and coffee and flour.
1302	Don't let the drunks stumble in and sleep on the pews.
1303	There's a butcher knife under that altar if you need it.
1304	And just, you know, try to make yourself useful.
1305	Don't leave the tent.
1306	You know, unless, it's on fire.
1307	Understood?  Either the roof or mum's hair  was set ablaze by the Harrigan brothers.
1308	Those bastards.
1309	Did they say if they were able to put the fire out? - What the hell is this strange wind? - The bloody last page is missing.
1310	Jesus! It's a whirlwind! Where did you No, no, no, no! Bloody hell.
1311	What are you I thought you said you were going to give us more time.
1312	You asked for a little more time, and that's what I gave you, a little more time.
1313	Ah! Put your backs into it there, boys! Come on, work, you mules.
1314	Hey, up! I want all the walking bosses right here, right now.
1315	Come on, Mr Toole.
1316	Y'all are getting paid to work the men until the payroll situation gets figured out.
1317	Again? If they aren't paid, they'll strike, Mr Bohannon.
1318	Then you keep quiet as long as you can.
1319	Hey, now, walking bosses only.
1320	I am a walking boss.
1321	Tell 'em you made me a walking boss.
1322	Get back to work.
1323	This about all you walking bosses getting paid again and we ain't getting paid again, right? Tell you what, you keep your mouth shut and you keep your job.
1324	Get back to work.
1325	Come on! Someone needs to put that boy in his place.
1326	and yet I remain stranded here, blocked by the great Rocky Mountains.
1327	The Rocky Mountains? They are some 500 miles from here.
1328	Beyond that rise, the Platte River forks.
1329	Do I follow it to the north or south? A mistake here and we could miss our strike on the Rockies by hundreds of miles.
1330	I'm assuming you strike the mountains at any route you take.
1331	The problem is not striking the mountains, Lily.
1332	The problem is crossing the mountains.
1333	And you think Robert was the only person who knew the way? It took him seven years and my open purse, but, yes, he told me he'd found it.
1334	Surely there'll be other surveys? Oh, yes.
1335	Yes, someone will build this railroad, but without the secret which Robert took to his grave, it will not be me.
1336	If I'm remembered, it will be as the man who failed.
1337	Unfortunately, Robert will probably not be remembered at all.
1338	Pay up, I'm gonna buy me a double hot soak.
1339	And liniment.
1340	And a bottle of whiskey that don't burn going down.
1341	We ain't getting paid.
1342	Well, they ain't pay us last week.
1343	I was figuring on double pay today.
1344	You might as well put that tool down and go back to camp.
1345	That's where I'm gonna be.
1346	Hey! Hey! It ain't quitting time.
1347	It is for me.
1348	I done worked for free my whole life, I ain't doing that no more.
1349	You get back in that cut.
1350	Get down off that horse and put me in the cut.
1351	I don't need some slave uprising on my hands this day.
1352	That's how you see it? All I see is some field hand acting like a house boy.
1353	Take off that gun.
1354	Take it off.
1355	:: come on.
1356	:: give it to him now, boy!Excuse me.
1357	Mr Bohannon! I hired you to run these men to build my railroad, not to wrestle in the dirt with your former chattel.
1358	:: What Is the meaning of this? Payroll!Lack of.
1359	And who told the men there is no payroll? I did.
1360	Then you told them nonsense.
1361	Gentlemen, I see that unfounded rumors have caused tempers to flare.
1362	Believe me, the payroll is en route, merely delayed.
1363	As for you and your sparring partner, Mr Bohannon, I suggest you settle your differences like the gentlemen I know you all to be.
1364	This evening, when you have completed your work, I suggest a pugilistic match between Mr Bohannon and his Negro nemesis.
1365	:: a real fight.
1366	Yeah! Yeah! And to compensate you for the tardiness of your well-earned pay, I will donate 10 cases of whiskey for your refreshment.
1367	I didn't know you had a daughter.
1368	Well, now you know.
1369	Why don't you ever speak of her? Are you really going to send her away? You know, Jesus says,  If any man come to me and not hate his father  and hate not his mother and his wife and his children and his own life,  then he cannot be my disciple.
1370	I don't think I have enough hate in my heart to be a good Christian.
1371	Whoa! Whoa! - Black Moon.
1372	:: Father.
1373	Why you have brought this man to our sacred place? He's putting a curse on you.
1374	He calls you Black Spider because you trapped my son in your web.
1375	Joseph came to Christ on his own free will.
1376	Is that so? Tell me, do you have no children of your own? I had I have a daughter.
1377	Who has just returned to him.
1378	Praise God.
1379	Where has she been? I left her.
1380	You abandon your child and steal mine.
1381	What kind of man are you? A flawed one.
1382	Father, Reverend Cole has come because he's concerned for our people.
1383	Chief, the soldiers have already come.
1384	Yeah.
1385	Four soldiers on horseback.
1386	But more will come, enough to wipe out all the human beings from the world.
1387	But there may be another way.
1388	If you come to town, we discuss peace.
1389	I will come, but only if my son Black Moon asks me to come.
1390	Please come.
1391	For me.
1392	Come inside, gentlemen, and witness the greatest contest in the history of Hell on Wheels! The finest corn liquor, compliments of Mr Thomas Durant, President of the Union Pacific Railroad.
1393	Hey, over here.
1394	Give me one of those.
1395	You must be able to spell your name to wager, you morons.
1396	Now, who just flung down that silver? This here's enough peppers to make a Mexican cry.
1397	It'll probably kill you.
1398	MICKEY: Sean's putting everything we got on you.
1399	I thought you were broke? We put the magic lantern up for collateral.
1400	:: Sure that was a Good idea? - Sure.
1401	The whole town's betting on you.
1402	There's time enough if you want to place a bet on yourself.
1403	No.
1404	I ain't doing this for money, Mick.
1405	Then why are you doing it? Hmm.
1406	That man needs to be put in his place.
1407	There's only one thing he understands.
1408	What if, God forbid, you were to lose? That ain't gonna happen.
1409	You win this fight, they're gonna kill you.
1410	And if you lose, they're gonna kill you for thinking you could win.
1411	You don't understand.
1412	This is something I gotta do.
1413	Why? Because you're half white or because you're half black? All my life folk been telling me who I am.
1414	One white man tell me I'm a slave, another one say I'm free.
1415	Tonight, I say who I am.
1416	Hello.
1417	Tonight and one night only, you will be allowed in.
1418	One sign of misbehavior and I will throw you all in chains.
1419	Understood? Good.
1420	You are welcome.
1421	Come in.
1422	Yeah.
1423	That's it.
1424	Your corner here.
1425	Mr Ferguson's corner.
1426	Bloody hell.
1427	Look at what the bowels of the place have shat out.
1428	Get the bloody hell out.
1429	What do you think you're doing? Make way for Mr Bohannon! Come on! Come on! You gonna win this fight, hear? You gonna win this fight for us.
1430	You hear me? - Jesus, he is a big buck, Mr Bohannon.
1431	- Ain't all about the brawn, Mick.
1432	Now, this fight is going to be a fair fight.
1433	No grappling below the waist.
1434	No eyeball gouging.
1435	No biting.
1436	No unnecessary kicking.
1437	Now, the fighters will come from their corners and toe this line.
1438	Mr Dix is going to be the referee for this contest.
1439	- No! Not fair! - Now, I assume both fighters are ready to fight.
1440	Toes on! Come on! Fight! Keep them back, will you? All right, boys, back to your corners.
1441	Back to your corners.
1442	Thirty seconds! Out of the way.
1443	Sit down.
1444	The bank is denying the request for a credit extension.
1445	Reply.
1446	If credit not extended forthwith, will call in all shares of aforesaid bank stock to be joined by other four major investors.
1447	Stop.
1448	Anticipate collapse of bank by close of business tomorrow.
1449	Stop.
1450	And send.
1451	Samson brought the temple down on his head.
1452	I will happily do the same.
1453	- Give him a fat lip, Mr Bohannon! - He already has two, lad! Get in there and fight, boy.
1454	Fight! Get him! Knock him down! Get up now.
1455	Come on, get up! Knock his nappy nigger ass out! Punch his black ass back to Africa! Get up! On your feet.
1456	:: Get up.
1457	:: Get up.
1458	Are you gonna start fighting or what? - Huh? Come on, fight! Got to see this, now.
1459	Break 'em up.
1460	Stand 'em up.
1461	Get up! Give us some room! Give us some room! Back it up! Get him to the corner, now.
1462	Hell's wrong with you? - Are you seeing what I'm seeing? - What? He ain't fighting.
1463	Hell's wrong with you, boy? Huh? Is it 'cause you ain't never hit no white man before? Is that it? Look here, son.
1464	That man who sired you, that won't your father.
1465	That white man who raped your mother.
1466	Ya hear? Same man done beat you all your life with his foot on your neck.
1467	Huh? Same man who say he your master when you supposed to be free.
1468	Huh? Look over here.
1469	That's him sitting on his soft white ass.
1470	I want you go over there, and I want you to kill him.
1471	You hear? You go kill him.
1472	You ain't gonna do this for us.
1473	Do this for you.
1474	Take a knee, Mr Bohannon.
1475	Take a knee! Come on! Come on! Come on! Back off! - Come on! - I knew you could do it! I told you, boy! Come on! You're all right.
1476	You're still in this.
1477	You still got it, Mr Bohannon.
1478	You still got it.
1479	Don't worry.
1480	Take a breather, boy.
1481	Take a breather.
1482	Lend to thy neighbor in time of his need,  and pay thou thy neighbor again in due season.
1483	Excuse me.
1484	That's all right, that's all right.
1485	We almost did it.
1486	We almost did it.
1487	Ms.
1488	Bell? Where have you been? I looked all over for you.
1489	I took a walk.
1490	And then I heard all the commotion.
1491	It's a little vulgar for a lady's taste, I'm afraid.
1492	Ah! I'm afraid my Latin is a little undernourished.
1493	Bread and circuses.
1494	Huh.
1495	You engineered this fight, as a distraction, until you could get payroll.
1496	Just like the Romans did with unruly crowds.
1497	Give them food and spectacle.
1498	I think you overestimate my abilities, Lily.
1499	I hope not, for all our sakes.
1500	Holy mother of God, you had us worried there.
1501	I thought, for a wee bit, we'd lost our wager.
1502	Right, Sean? Sean? Sean? Shall I walk you back to the car? I have Robert's maps.
1503	And, yes.
1504	He found the route.
1505	To the Rockies? And beyond.
1506	And you've had them all this time? I have.
1507	I knew it! I knew it! Oh, I could strangle you and embrace you at the same time.
1508	- Where are they? - They're in a safe place.
1509	Ah! How much? What Robert is owed.
1510	All right.
1511	Let's go.
1512	Let's go.
1513	All right.
1514	That's right.
1515	That's right.
1516	You gonna do this.
1517	All right? Time! Now, boy.
1518	Now! Here you go.
1519	You got it.
1520	You got it.
1521	One more time.
1522	Get in there.
1523	Come on, Bohannon! Get up! Get your hands up.
1524	Get your hands up.
1525	Hit him! Come on, man.
1526	Come on! Come on, Bohannon.
1527	That's right.
1528	Get in there.
1529	It's over! It's over! Why are you so glib? We just lost everything.
1530	I bet it all on the darkie.
1531	We're rich, Brother.
1532	What'd you use? The liniment? Mmm? It was a little pepper powder to the eyes, was it? Are you trying to get us both killed? And Mr Bohannon being our only friend and all.
1533	This is my only friend.
1534	Are you all right? Never better.
1535	Good.
1536	:: Did you enjoy the fight? - Very much.
1537	Good.
1538	Thank you for the water.
1539	Ah.
1540	Next.
1541	Gregory Toole, walking boss for cut crew three.
1542	And to be completely honest with you, Mr Bohannon, we thought you had more in you.
1543	Mmm.
1544	Life does have its surprises, don't it, Mr Toole? Next.
1545	Elam Ferguson.
1546	Walking boss, freedmen cut crew.
1547	You've done it, my son.
1548	The sacrifice is over.
1549	Father.
1550	I was blessed.
1551	I had a vision.
1552	I've seen the great steel beast.
1553	Its breath was smoke.
1554	It shook the ground.
1555	I killed it.
1556	Make sure that's tight.
1557	Closer.
1558	Closer to the platform.
1559	Musicians, come on, over here, over here.
1560	Thank you.
1561	What are you going to play? - Dixie.
1562	:: not Dixie, you idiot.
1563	Battle Hymn of the Republic, do you know it? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, fine.
1564	Thank you.
1565	Thank you.
1566	Thank you.
1567	Photographer, over here, please, on the platform with me and be at the ready.
1568	Now, on my signal, be ready to play, loudly.
1569	She takes my arm even though she stabs me in the back.
1570	Have you given my proposal any further consideration? You mean the money you're squeezing out of me for Robert's maps? I'm only asking for what is fair, Thomas.
1571	Extortion doesn't become a lady.
1572	I will not fall prey to it.
1573	Excuse me.
1574	Play, play, play, play, play.
1575	Ah, Jordan.
1576	Welcome, welcome.
1577	Ladies and gentlemen, it is an honor for me to introduce a true friend of the railroad who has come here with the full backing of the United States Senate, to meet with the Indians, to thwart their opposition to our cause.
1578	From the great state of Illinois, Senator Jordan Crane.
1579	On behalf of my fellow committee members, I thank you for that warm reception.
1580	But down to business.
1581	As Mr Durant said, I am here, laurel branch in hand, to meet with the Indians.
1582	But, in the other hand, I wield a cudgel, and that cudgel is the full and mighty force of the United States military.
1583	If these savages want a scrap, then by God, we'll give them one they won't soon disremember.
1584	Well done.
1585	Well done.
1586	First, the fuzzies, and now they're letting the Injuns come for a party.
1587	I tell you, lads, we'll soon be working for the likes of them.
1588	- It's a sad state of affairs.
1589	I'll drink to that.
1590	Reverend, you ain't in here for a drink, are you? No, a spirit of a different sort now possesses me.
1591	I come here, Mr Bohannon, hat in hand.
1592	I wish to hell you would stop trying to save me, Preacher.
1593	Oh, don't worry, son, I'm learning my limitations Uh-huh.
1594	but the Lord believes one good turn deserves another.
1595	And since I provided asylum for you, I've come here to ask for your help.
1596	What kind of help could I possibly provide you? Well, a band of Cheyenne is coming to talk peace with the senator and Mr Durant.
1597	Yeah.
1598	I heard.
1599	Whose crazy-ass idea was that? I beg your pardon, Preacher, but somehow, I don't see that ending well.
1600	I want you to talk to your walking bosses, you tell them to keep their men in check because if you don't, we're gonna have bloodshed on our hands.
1601	I'll do what I can.
1602	Do I have your word? A toast in honor of the fair-haired maiden of the West.
1603	Your spirit is a testament to all.
1604	Thank you, Senator.
1605	You must be anxious to return to society.
1606	I am, but first I must tend to some unfinished business.
1607	Well, speaking of which, you won't mind if Mr Durant and I discuss some business of our own? Not at all, Senator, please.
1608	So, Doc, I hear there was some delay with your payroll.
1609	Why the money problems? Oh.
1610	A miscommunication between the bank and Pinkerton's.
1611	No, no, no, no, the payroll was delivered and made.
1612	Well, then the credit issue with the banks must also be resolved? Credit issue? Well, I don't know the particulars, but word is credit was no longer being extended to the Union Pacific.
1613	Senator, if our credit line wasn't open, we wouldn't be able to operate.
1614	Mmm-hmm.
1615	What about the route to the Rockies? The Rockies.
1616	What of it? Thomas has been trying to explain it to me.
1617	I think I finally managed to grasp it.
1618	That the route my husband mapped through the Rockies holds the key to Thomas choosing the right path to make his 40 miles here.
1619	Is that right, Doc? - Well, I wouldn't go - Do you have these maps? No.
1620	Well Well, that is unfortunate.
1621	No 40 miles by May 16, no government subsidies.
1622	You have heard that the Central Pacific have made their 40, haven't you? No.
1623	Oh, yes.
1624	It seems these Chinamen are quite the busy worker bees.
1625	Then she say,  With one of these, I can get whatever I want.
1626	Yeah, I need a word with Mr Ferguson.
1627	If that's all right? I'll talk to him.
1628	You ain't gotta worry about us messing with no Injuns.
1629	Ain't no red man ever bloodied my back.
1630	I got your word, then? Good.
1631	We don't need no more fighting, do we? I see how you feel that way, after that ass-whooping I put on you.
1632	I got news for you, son, I know you cheated.
1633	- What the hell are you talking about? - You know damn well what I'm talking about.
1634	Pepper juice on them hand wraps you was wearing, I tasted it.
1635	I got to hand it to you, though, that was pretty slick.
1636	You need to hand that to somebody else.
1637	I don't know nothing about no pepper juice.
1638	Huh.
1639	Somebody sure as hell cheated.
1640	If you want a re-match, you know where to find me.
1641	Yeah.
1642	How did your mother die? Consumption.
1643	She's with God now.
1644	Yes, she is.
1645	My mother died when I was just a boy.
1646	I remember her taking me to the creek to wash in the mornings.
1647	She'd pretend to drop me and then grab me fast.
1648	No matter how many times she did it, it would always make me laugh.
1649	She's with God now, too.
1650	Was your mother a Christian? No.
1651	Then how can she be with God? I'm sorry your father left you and your mother alone.
1652	My father did not leave us.
1653	He was called away on his great Christian mission.
1654	He's a servant of God, and was called to help the inferiors, like Negroes.
1655	And the Indians? Would you like to hold it for me, or do you have some information? Mr Durant has taken private funds from the railroad for his personnel use.
1656	How much, and for what? $147,000.
1657	He is speculating on the railroad stock.
1658	Money is not necessary this time.
1659	Oh.
1660	I would like information instead.
1661	What do you mean? There is a man named Harper, a former Union soldier, Sergeant Frank Harper, I believe.
1662	He used to work for us.
1663	He ran off.
1664	I'd like to know where he is.
1665	How am I supposed to find him? I heard Sergeant Harper hails from your home state of Illinois.
1666	Matter of fact, he still has family that reside in the city of Chicago.
1667	Frank Harper.
1668	Well, I'll have my people Yes, you will.
1669	Set it out somewhere here.
1670	There you go, men.
1671	Keep it moving there, lads.
1672	What's wrong, man? Clear! Down! I'll be damned.
1673	Come on now, up and out of there, boys.
1674	It's our turn for collecting some scalps.
1675	Y'all Negroes get back in that cut.
1676	We ain't got no fight with them Injuns.
1677	Y'all heard the man.
1678	Well, well.
1679	What's the matter, boyo? You niggers afraid the nappy fuzz will be sliced off the top of your pates, are you? We ain't got no dog in this fight.
1680	You on your own.
1681	We got business, you and me, and I'll see it done, so I will.
1682	Why are we stopped? - We ain't.
1683	:: Toole, Get your men back in that cut!We got a road to build.
1684	I want y'all sons of bitches working, all of you.
1685	I don't take orders from any man walloped by a nigger.
1686	You're fired.
1687	Get off my cut.
1688	I'll fix your flint for this, Bohannon.
1689	You have my word on that.
1690	Oh, yeah? Get off my cut.
1691	Come on, lads, let's go.
1692	The hell with it.
1693	Get the hell out of me way.
1694	All right, there's work to get done.
1695	Y'all forget about them Injuns, and you give me the full chisel, assholes and elbows, or I'll fire the lot of you.
1696	You seem to have an answer for everything, Thomas.
1697	I always do.
1698	But why should I believe you? Well, why wouldn't you, Jordan? It's the truth.
1699	We've worked together long enough for you to give me a little more credit than that.
1700	Is there a point you're trying to make, Jordan? To the point.
1701	I'm well aware of your schemes, and to put it plain, they don't concern me, except when they concern me.
1702	Jordan, why are you really here? I'm here to tell you that filching Union Pacific Railroad funds for personal speculating concerns me greatly.
1703	Another unfounded rumor created by my rivals.
1704	$147,000.00
1705	How's that for an unfounded rumor? People say you've lost a lot of money in the market, Doc.
1706	Is it really so bad that it's come to this? I have nothing more to say about this.
1707	# I am here # Right here # Where God puts none asunder # And you # Black dress, black shoes # You do # Invite me under # Go on # Go there # You can # See me aging # The stars turn # Balls burn # Come for more scalps, have you? Welcome to our town.
1708	Don't be afraid.
1709	You're among friends.
1710	I am Reverend Cole.
1711	These are my children, Joseph and Ruth.
1712	We are pleased you have come here in the name of peace and fellowship.
1713	Are you the daughter he abandoned? Maybe peace and fellowship are more important to him than his own family.
1714	This, Senator Crane, he's from the United States government.
1715	Do you understand? I speak your language.
1716	Well, good.
1717	Senator Crane has come here to offer your people a better way of life.
1718	Better than what? Better than what you have.
1719	I like what I have.
1720	I understand that.
1721	But your people live in the Stone Age.
1722	We live at the beginning of a great industrial revolution.
1723	- He doesn't understand why Chief, Chief, Chief.
1724	The United States government is offering you a piece of land of your own.
1725	:: we have our own land.
1726	No, it's not yours.
1727	It's the US government's.
1728	:: Did they buy it? - No.
1729	- Did they trade for it? - It's not like that.
1730	We Then how can they own it? He has a point.
1731	If you accept our offer, you won't have to hunt buffalo anymore or roam the prairie.
1732	You can depend on your country to take care of you.
1733	You are not my country.
1734	We will give you everything you need, if you will just submit to living on a reservation.
1735	We need nothing from you.
1736	- Mr Durant, if we could just - I'm done, Reverend! Good luck.
1737	# God in three persons, Blessed trinity # Jesus Christ? She asked who Jesus Christ is.
1738	I told her Jesus Christ is our savior, born of a virgin.
1739	What did she say, Joseph? She said she would like to hear Mary explain the virgin birth to her husband.
1740	Mr Bohannon.
1741	Ma'am.
1742	What are you doing here? Well, I guess I made a stupid promise to somebody.
1743	I figured the last thing you'd want to see is an Indian.
1744	Well, these are peaceful Indians.
1745	They're Joseph's people.
1746	Yeah, right.
1747	Yeah, you're right, go ahead.
1748	No, it's not the Indians I'm worried about.
1749	You'll be happy to know I've taken your advice.
1750	I'm making arrangements for passage back East.
1751	Best place for you.
1752	Right.
1753	Well, if you'd excuse What's wrong? Mrs Bell? Where did you get that? That's mine! Not yours.
1754	:: Stop.
1755	It's all right.
1756	- Take your hands off me! Go! Calm down! Take That's your husband's hat, wasn't it? Wasn't it? What happened, Mr Bohannon? You.
1757	You lied to me.
1758	It was your people.
1759	Where are you headed? I'm going to tell Mr Durant that they're here, the ones that committed the massacre, the ones who murdered my husband.
1760	:: are you Sure you want to do that? - Yes, of course I am.
1761	Why wouldn't I? 'Cause it will lead to more killing, not just the braves, but the women and children, too.
1762	What is your stake in this, Mr Bohannon? Lady, I ain't got one.
1763	Then why do you care? Mrs Bell, there is a price attached to everything.
1764	You think you can afford the cost of this, then you go on.
1765	You must think of your women and children.
1766	I am thinking of them.
1767	How can I ask them to give up what they have for this? I have never seen such a dark, filthy place.
1768	If you walk away from here without a deal, you are asking for war.
1769	No.
1770	You ask for war.
1771	Listen to reason.
1772	Your people will be slaughtered.
1773	As will yours.
1774	Gentlemen! We're here to find a way to peace, not war.
1775	Be warned.
1776	We Cheyenne are plenty, and my braves are hungry for a good fight.
1777	Enough, Jordan, enough of your pissing in the wind.
1778	They only understand one thing, strength.
1779	Now, let me give it to you plain and simple, Chief.
1780	This train means the end of life as you know it.
1781	My son had a vision.
1782	He will defeat your train.
1783	Wait.
1784	Chief, perhaps your son would like a chance to see his vision come true? Hmm? Hello, ladies.
1785	What is this all about? It seems an Injun's gonna race the train back to town.
1786	I guess you changed your mind.
1787	For the moment.
1788	Stoke that fire.
1789	Come on.
1790	Come on.
1791	Come on! Come on! Ha! Well, I think the chief got my message loud and clear.
1792	- Don't you? - Well done, Doc.
1793	But there's still the matter of $147,000.
1794	One word from me and hordes of investigators will be crawling through your books.
1795	- You're bluffing.
1796	:: What makes you think so? Because If I fall, you fall with me.
1797	Hmm.
1798	Not so, Doc.
1799	Not so.
1800	I sold all my landholdings in Nebraska, and I've divested myself of my Crédit Mobilier stock, all at a nice profit, I might add.
1801	You have nothing over me anymore.
1802	You once had my head in a vice, Thomas.
1803	Now, I have your pecker in my pocket.
1804	I'll be leaving for Chicago tonight and will report this as soon as I arrive.
1805	You'll be trading in your fancy duds for prison pinstripes.
1806	You're finished, Durant.
1807	All this, gone.
1808	Jordan, please.
1809	She wants you to take this.
1810	And she wanted you to know she, too, has lost her husband.
1811	He was killed in a fight with one of his own arrows.
1812	The other braves, they brought her this hat.
1813	Tell her thank you.
1814	:: we will not return.
1815	:: Chief, I beg you to reconsider.
1816	Son, these people are not good.
1817	If you stay here, you will die.
1818	Come back with me.
1819	Please.
1820	Come home with your father.
1821	I can't, Father.
1822	I can't.
1823	Is the chief your father? Why did you leave him? So I could help the inferiors.
1824	# Believe me if all those endearing young charms # Which I gaze on so fondly today # Were to change by tomorrow and fleet in my arms # Like fairy gifts fading away # Though would'st still be adored # As this moment thou art # Let thy loveliness fade as it will # And around the dear ruin Each wish of my heart # Would entwine itself verdantly still # You were right.
1825	Sit down.
1826	Robert needed you as much as you needed him.
1827	My husband died for his dream.
1828	Now it's up to you to bring it to life.
1829	The blasted red devils are just up on the hill.
1830	I say we go get 'em now, bring back their bloody heads on pikes.
1831	Now where else might y'all be headed? Out of the way, Bohannon.
1832	We aim to go after the Injuns, and there's nothing you can do about it.
1833	The hell there ain't.
1834	You're outnumbered.
1835	You can't kill us all, lad.
1836	I can kill about five of you.
1837	You hear that? He's not even fully loaded.
1838	Only five bullets he's got.
1839	I got six bullets.
1840	I was just gonna shoot you twice.
1841	:: Trouble? Yeah.
1842	There's still only two of you.
1843	I'd count again if I were you.
1844	You see, it is important to Mr Thomas Durant that the Injuns are not harmed.
1845	I'm sure you boys can find some amusement here in town.
1846	Let's go, boys.
1847	Careful now.
1848	We want Eva.
1849	The one the Injuns marked up.
1850	Well, you have to poke another, she ain't here.
1851	Where is the heathen bitch? I don't know.
1852	I ain't seen her since the train race.
1853	I know where to find her.
1854	You know what people think.
1855	Two peas in a pod, huh? I say we go get him now.
1856	This is the one.
1857	Get dressed.
1858	We didn't do nothing! Let him go! We was just talking.
1859	Leave her alone.
1860	No.
1861	Get moving.
1862	Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands,  as is fitting in the Lord.
1863	Husbands, love your wives  and do not be harsh with them.
1864	Children, obey your parents in everything,  for this pleases the Lord.
1865	Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything,  not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favor,  but with sin  Sincerity.
1866	sincerity of the heart and reverence of the Lord.
1867	Well, I don't believe it.
1868	How old are you, boy? I ain't but nine years, sir.
1869	Pay up, gentlemen.
1870	It's dangerous, you know, teaching them to read.
1871	- That's true.
1872	Nat Turner was taught to read.
1873	:: Nonsense.
1874	Let me show you.
1875	Boy, can you explain to me the meaning of what you just read? No, master.
1876	See? It's like a parrot reciting Shakespeare.
1877	Well done, Elam.
1878	Well done.
1879	Now I have heard the groaning of the Israelites,  whom the Egyptians hold in slavery,  and I have remembered my promise.
1880	Say unto the children of Israel,  I am the Lord.
1881	And I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians,  and I will rid you out from under their bondage,  and I will redeem you with a stretched-out arm,  and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
1882	Behold Robert Bell's legacy, gentlemen.
1883	We follow the North Platte clear into Wyoming, and we skirt the Black Hills to the south, and strike the Rockies here.
1884	He found the way through.
1885	Now, we have payroll, we have manpower, we have material.
1886	I expect no further delays in making the 40 miles by the government deadline.
1887	:: Am I understood? - Yes, sir.
1888	:: Yes, sir, Mr Durant.
1889	:: Good.
1890	And we will finish on schedule? We won't finish anything if I don't dig myself out of this hole we're in.
1891	:: How long will you be gone, sir? - a few days.
1892	I'm escorting Mrs Bell to Chicago.
1893	Oh! You can wipe that lascivious look off your face.
1894	It's not what you think.
1895	I'm seeing Senator Crane.
1896	But I have seen how she look at you.
1897	:: Nonsense.
1898	- No, it's true.
1899	Hmm.
1900	I guess you're leaving.
1901	I'm going to Chicago, to see my late husband's family.
1902	Then it's on to England.
1903	You don't sound too excited about going home.
1904	I don't have a home anymore.
1905	I had hoped to stay here, with Robert, forever, settle down on a ranch or a farm, raise a family, grow old and die together.
1906	The world don't care much for our plans, Mrs Bell.
1907	Indeed it don't, Mr Bohannon.
1908	Do try and stay out of trouble.
1909	I'll try, ma'am.
1910	Mr Bohannon! Mr Bohannon! Mr Bohannon! You've got to stop them.
1911	- What the hell happened? - Elam, they're gonna hang him.
1912	- How the hell is that my problem? - You've gotta do something.
1913	Talk to the Swede.
1914	He's the head of security.
1915	He's the one gave them the go ahead.
1916	Said his men are gonna let off some steam.
1917	Move them tables aside! Move that table! Clear out! Anybody squeamish about a hanging had best move along right now! Let him loose! Let him loose or there's going to be a river of Mick blood flowing in here! There'll be an ocean of nigger blood.
1918	I guarantee that.
1919	Boys.
1920	Looks like you've brung shovels to a gunfight.
1921	Well, no matter.
1922	We'll use them to dig your graves.
1923	We'll take our chances.
1924	Put them weapons down.
1925	This here's between them and me.
1926	Ain't no use in none of y'all getting shot dead for it.
1927	I can't do that.
1928	- We can't just walk away.
1929	- You've got to walk away, else the rest of y'all gonna get killed, too.
1930	I say we finish him now.
1931	Mr Toole.
1932	Mr Toole.
1933	Give me your word they ain't gonna come to no harm if they walk away.
1934	You have my word.
1935	Tell your men to put their guns down.
1936	Lower your guns, boys.
1937	Go on now.
1938	:: Elam.
1939	:: you all git.
1940	Go on! You hear me? Get out of here.
1941	Go on.
1942	Tuck your tails! Ain't nothing we can do.
1943	I don't know whether you're aware of it, but we Irish are the niggers of the British Empire.
1944	That's what this is about? You showing the world you ain't at the bottom of the barrel no more? You're damn right it is.
1945	Any last words? I'm gonna kill your lily white ass.
1946	When we meet in hell, perhaps.
1947	Go on, now! Go to it, boys! Drop him.
1948	Shoot him! Will somebody please shoot the bastard? Well, you shoot him.
1949	Cut his ties.
1950	Let's go! Got a horse outside waiting for you.
1951	Any of y'all thinking about coming after me best get fitted for a shroud and a box.
1952	Just climb on the sumbitch and hang on.
1953	Sure is a stupid-looking spud muncher, ain't he? Some respect for the dead, Mr Bolan.
1954	In the end, when all is said and done, all we really own is our death.
1955	It is given us the moment we is born, and we carry that burden the best we can.
1956	I've seen men die screaming.
1957	I've seen men die with nary a peep.
1958	Well, this one here died trying to draw down on Cullen Bohannon.
1959	Well, then, perhaps he was stupid after all.
1960	Now, this hanging of yours went not so well.
1961	He was as good as dead till Johnny Reb came busting in here.
1962	What do you propose to do about it? What do you mean? Well, this brigand, this rebel has upset the balance once again.
1963	And he must be dealt with.
1964	I still don't follow.
1965	Why does that not surprise me? You must pursue Bohannon.
1966	Hmm? - Me? - Yeah.
1967	I don't know nothing about warfare and such.
1968	You created this mess, and you'll clean it up or die trying.
1969	I'll not do it.
1970	Jesus! Now, all of you that was involved in this hanging will accompany Mr Toole on his noble quest.
1971	How the hell do you expect these bogtrotters to track down Bohannon? Well, that's their problem.
1972	Let me and Dix take them.
1973	Hmm? I'll track him down like a rabid dog.
1974	Hold.
1975	Slow up, slow up, slow up.
1976	:: Why we stopping here? - Good a place as any.
1977	Bohannon.
1978	- What you did for me back at that saloon - What the hell was you thinking? You carrying on with a white woman? - I'm a free man.
1979	- You ain't that free.
1980	- Why you get to decide that? - I ain't decide nothing.
1981	That's the way of the world.
1982	What's it like to own somebody, Mr Cullen? Any different than owning a dog or a pig or a plough? I treated my people well, if that's what you're asking.
1983	Your people? You make it sound like they was family to you.
1984	Well, one of them practically raised me after my mother died.
1985	Yeah, but You be owning her.
1986	Even if she changed your dirty drawers, you still be owning her.
1987	I wouldn't mind owning me a white woman.
1988	Yes, sir.
1989	That might be nice.
1990	Maybe I'd bring her in from the fields of an evening and have me some fun.
1991	Watch yourself.
1992	And what if she give me a baby boy? Would I own that, too? Or would half of him be free? And what if I bring that boy into my house from time to time and teach him to read and write? And I give that boy just enough hope to think that maybe, just maybe, he different.
1993	Different than all the other white folk I own.
1994	Nah.
1995	He ain't no different.
1996	He just a mule.
1997	Everybody know a mule ain't no horse.
1998	Ain't that right, Mr Cullen? Damn it all.
1999	Damn it all.
2000	- I'm sorry, I - No! Ma'am, please, stay.
2001	You weren't at dinner.
2002	I supped on brandy.
2003	Five course meal.
2004	Do you know what this is? - It's a penny.
2005	:: I wish it were just a penny, rather than the seed of my own destruction.
2006	I don't understand.
2007	I was raised in a shanty town, in Hell's Kitchen.
2008	Only difference between us and the rats were the rats were better fed and cleaner.
2009	I'm sorry to hear that.
2010	I don't want your sympathy.
2011	One day, while I was rummaging through the trash for a meal, some gentlemen passed me by.
2012	One of them told me he would give me a penny if I ate a putrid apple that even the rats had passed over.
2013	I I will never forget that taste.
2014	It was all I could do to keep it down.
2015	They had a good laugh, and one of them tossed me the coin.
2016	And on that day, my bark was set on a course that neither tempest nor Leviathan could alter.
2017	I would have it all, and I would have it on my terms.
2018	I know no other way, Lily.
2019	I faced ruin many times and I always found a way out.
2020	But this time, I fear, I may not recover.
2021	Is this Thomas Durant or some blubbering schoolboy I see before me? I gave you those maps so you could finish the railroad.
2022	For Robert's sake.
2023	I won't let you quit.
2024	Get your head out of that bottle and figure out a way.
2025	I gave my slaves their freedom before the war started.
2026	Damn near went broke paying their wages.
2027	I'm supposed to thank you for that? No.
2028	I only did it for my wife.
2029	I sure as hell didn't understand it.
2030	It pissed me off, tell you the truth.
2031	So why'd you do it, then? Well, Mary had a way of talking me into things.
2032	It wasn't until I come home from the war, right then, actually, that I understood that she was right.
2033	I found Mary where she was hanged, you know, but I couldn't find my boy.
2034	We'd always play hide and go seek, and he'd always hide up in the hayloft.
2035	Every damned time, every time.
2036	He'd And I'd just pretend like I couldn't find him.
2037	See, the Yankees, they burned the barn, but it was still standing, and there he was, up in the hayloft.
2038	His body was curled up, and his arms was hugging his knees to his chest.
2039	But he wasn't alone.
2040	Bethel, the woman who raised me, she was with him.
2041	She had her arms wrapped around him, like she was protecting him from the flame.
2042	Both their bodies, they were scorched black, fused together.
2043	Couldn't really tell where one of them ended and the other one began.
2044	And I just remember standing there and thinking to myself,  God's got a funny way of teaching you things.
2045	Huh? Yeah.
2046	I wouldn't give a shit if I was you, either.
2047	:: you ever shoot a gun? - Oh, Yeah.
2048	Massah let us shoot guns on the plantation all the time.
2049	You try.
2050	You got to cock it.
2051	Again.
2052	Keep firing.
2053	:: Damn.
2054	- You're ready.
2055	What do you mean, I'm ready? I can't even hit the dang tree.
2056	Well, you're just gonna have to get in close, then.
2057	How am I going to get up close without getting shot? Whoever you're shooting at is going to be just as scared as you are.
2058	You take your time.
2059	Don't lose your head.
2060	Count your rounds as you fire.
2061	If you're calm, you'll count their rounds, too.
2062	The trick is making sure the other man has to reload before you do.
2063	And if I don't? You're dead.
2064	End of lesson.
2065	:: Good morning.
2066	:: Lily: Good morning, Thomas.
2067	I think I may have found a way out of my mess.
2068	Now, this is a map of all the other railroads, an intricate web of iron connecting all the eastern cities.
2069	But something is missing.
2070	Can you see it? There is no direct route connecting the Union Pacific to New York, yet.
2071	Well done.
2072	Why not? Well, I have two choices.
2073	I can build a beltline to the R&R or to the M&M line, further south.
2074	I own substantial stock in the R&R.
2075	I don't understand how this helps you out of your mess.
2076	A stock tip like that could have the President himself eating out of my hand.
2077	If I know Senator Crane, that's exactly what he's after.
2078	I didn't know they had something planned.
2079	I don't know them well.
2080	I've only met them once.
2081	I'm sure they'll be very happy to see you.
2082	I'm not so sure.
2083	Can't you stay a while? I have to meet with Senator Crane, but I'll be back later to take you to your hotel.
2084	:: Lily.
2085	:: Mrs Bell.
2086	I am so sorry to see you under such circumstances.
2087	Thank you, my dear.
2088	:: Emily.
2089	:: Lily.
2090	Charlotte.
2091	I see, by your dress, you're already out of mourning.
2092	- I didn't know.
2093	- Let's go meet the guests, shall we? Jordan, I'm afraid you have me by the short hairs.
2094	I came here today, hat in hand, to beseech you.
2095	Show some mercy.
2096	I'm almost tempted to see this through and let you rot in jail.
2097	Almost? So there's hope? There's hope.
2098	But it's going to cost you.
2099	Name your price, sir.
2100	I want to know if you're connecting to the R&R or the M&M.
2101	Prison it is then.
2102	I shall contact the authorities now.
2103	You'll be ruined, Doc.
2104	Your railroad snatched from you.
2105	It's the R&R.
2106	:: When will you announce? - Friday.
2107	You still have plenty of time.
2108	Put everything you have into it.
2109	You'll be a millionaire by the end of the week.
2110	But don't tell a soul.
2111	Robert brought this painting with him to London.
2112	It was on display when I went to see him lecture.
2113	I'm sure you're sorry you ever left the comfort of London after what you've been through.
2114	Soon you will be returning to your old life, and your dreadful experiences out there will seem like a bad dream.
2115	The nerve of her, showing up with that Durant.
2116	Look at her peacocking around in that garish dress.
2117	I'd like to give her a good drubbing.
2118	If she hadn't been there, Robert may have been able to save himself.
2119	He killed that savage with his dying breath so she could live.
2120	I begged Robert not to marry the woman.
2121	Spoiled, pampered aristocrat.
2122	Fair-haired maiden of the West.
2123	Indeed.
2124	Robert didn't kill the savage, Charlotte.
2125	I did.
2126	You lying little brat.
2127	:: Lily.
2128	:: Hold your tongue, madam.
2129	Robert did give his life saving me.
2130	He is the reason I still draw breath, but I didn't just stand back and watch it happen.
2131	We fought together, side by side, just as we lived.
2132	I wouldn't expect you to understand that, Charlotte.
2133	Robert fought hard, but the Indian prevailed.
2134	I watched him murder my husband, and he would have killed me next.
2135	But I tore an arrow from my shoulder and thrust it through his throat.
2136	And I pushed.
2137	And I didn't stop pushing until he was dead.
2138	So that's your fair-haired maiden of the West.
2139	Lily.
2140	I think it's time to go.
2141	Right here.
2142	Yeah, they've been gone for hours.
2143	This is madness.
2144	We're never gonna catch them.
2145	Shut the hell up.
2146	We ain't done nothing wrong.
2147	If you guys had been better at tracking, we would have found them already.
2148	Still warm.
2149	Ambush! Ambush! Where are they shooting from? Am I dying? Yeah.
2150	Will I find peace where I'm bound? I don't know if men like us ever find peace, Mr Bolan, in this world or the next.
2151	But I hope so.
2152	I really do.
2153	What are you smiling at? You empty.
2154	Any last words? Go to hell, you black My name is Elam Ferguson.
2155	You be sure to tell the devil that when he asks who killed you.
2156	Why so glum, Jordan? The stock could always recover.
2157	I lost everything.
2158	- You still have your Senator's salary.
2159	- This isn't over.
2160	There's still the matter of the missing $147,000.
2161	Already back in the company's till.
2162	Some strange sort of accounting mistake.
2163	People have already lost their jobs over it.
2164	And just to be sure, I've applied grease to all the proper machinery.
2165	Rumor has it, you made three million off the deal.
2166	Five.
2167	I managed to buy the M&M stock at quite a discount.
2168	But don't tell a soul.
2169	Thomas, please, I have a family.
2170	Don't worry, Jordan.
2171	You're still of some use to me.
2172	Well, in the meantime, here's a shiny new penny for you.
2173	:: are you Sure about this? - Yes.
2174	But what will you do? Where will you live? I haven't figured it out yet.
2175	I do know that I cannot go back to London.
2176	I cannot go back to a life I now despise.
2177	Then it's decided.
2178	I knew you would understand.
2179	Lily, there's something I must tell you.
2180	:: Thomas - No, No, I must say this.
2181	I am a man, and what I have with my wife is It is not what a man needs.
2182	Ours was always a practical marriage.
2183	I mean, there was a time when But that time has passed.
2184	What I'm saying is if I had a woman like you by my side, then No.
2185	If I had you by my side, Lily, there is nothing I We couldn't do together.
2186	This isn't fair on you.
2187	I know.
2188	I know that.
2189	Don't say anything.
2190	If there is a chance, if there is the glimmer of the faintest chance, then you will make me a very happy man.
2191	What about Toole? He out in them woods with a bullet in him.
2192	They all dead? Yep.
2193	Found this in one of his saddlebags.
2194	You reckon I should say something? Suit yourself.
2195	I don't really know my Bible verses.
2196	Twenty-third Psalm.
2197	The Lord is my shepherd.
2198	I shall not want.
2199	He maketh me to lie down in the green pastures.
2200	He leadeth me beside the still waters.
2201	He restoreth my soul.
2202	He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness  for His name's sake.
2203	Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,  I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me.
2204	Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
2205	Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,  and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
2206	Thomas.
2207	What the hell was that? Why have we stopped? Excuse me.
2208	Come on now.
2209	Get in here.
2210	Let me help you.
2211	Thomas Durant? We gonna make them Injuns pay for derailing this train.
2212	Right away, I want you to get back to Hell on Wheels, rouse those useless drunken cavalry men.
2213	Yes, sir.
2214	And get Bohannon.
2215	I want him to go with them.
2216	Mr Bohannon is a fugitive, sir.
2217	A fugitive? From what? From whom? There was an incident in the saloon.
2218	Mr Bohannon killed one of our men as we was attempting to hang a Negro.
2219	You were hanging a Negro in the saloon? He was caught with a white woman.
2220	:: a white woman? - Yeah.
2221	:: you mean one of the whores? - Yes, sir.
2222	You were going to hang a Negro for screwing a whore? It seemed appropriate.
2223	Those freed slaves work twice as hard for half the pay.
2224	Have they deserted us? Only the one they was hanging.
2225	Bohannon cut him loose and they rode off.
2226	And I sent a posse in pursuit.
2227	You have run off the man I wish to pursue the savages.
2228	Nice work, Mr Gundersen.
2229	I am unarmed, please! I beg for your mercy.
2230	No! No! No! Settle down, boy.
2231	Hold still.
2232	LILY: Mr Bohannon.
2233	What on earth are you doing? Have you quite finished? Mr Bohannon! That's enough.
2234	I need to see you back in Hell on Wheels right away.
2235	Don't.
2236	It's the engineer, he's badly burnt.
2237	What kind of monster would do this? Oh, my God.
2238	All is lost.
2239	:: all Is lost.
2240	- Don't say that.
2241	I was a fool to believe that love could prevail over hate.
2242	No.
2243	You have to believe, now more than ever.
2244	Pray with us, Father.
2245	Pray? God has abandoned this terrible place.
2246	Blood is God here.
2247	Just as it was in Kansas and in Babylon in the old book.
2248	As it always was and always will be.
2249	No, Reverend, please.
2250	They're sending soldiers to kill your people, Joseph.
2251	I'm sorry I failed you.
2252	My whole life My life's become a ridiculous failure.
2253	My whole life.
2254	Oh, Jesus.
2255	My Jesus Christ! Yes, Jesus.
2256	Papa? What's wrong? Ruth.
2257	Father? Father? Father? Father? Father? - I didn't sign on to be no Indian fighter.
2258	You didn't sign on at all.
2259	I spared your neck from the noose because you told me that building a railroad was like fighting a war.
2260	This is the war, Mr Bohannon.
2261	GRIGGS: Are you telling me you want me to bring this Johnny Reb along? Yes.
2262	GRIGGS: No.
2263	Hell, no.
2264	I don't take orders from you.
2265	But you do take orders from my good friend, General Dodge.
2266	You are aware that he worked for me before the war, aren't you? I can always send a telegram if you don't believe me.
2267	What about him? This is Joseph Black Moon.
2268	He is willing to lead you to his father's camp.
2269	Now, why the hell would he do that? Joseph will negotiate with his father for the handover of the renegades who caused the derailment, for a guarantee.
2270	No harm comes to the women and children.
2271	What kind of soldier do you think I am? I don't know.
2272	That's why I want your guarantee.
2273	So, it's agreed? Agreed.
2274	But I don't like it one damn bit.
2275	Thank you, Joseph.
2276	You may go.
2277	What you asking me to do here, sir? We can't risk that hothead, Griggs, starting a war with the Cheyenne right now.
2278	We haven't enough troops.
2279	But I cannot allow them to continue to terrorize my railroad.
2280	:: you want revenge? - I want justice.
2281	Different words for the same thing.
2282	Kill the renegades, Mr Bohannon.
2283	What you doing back here? Lovely to see you, too.
2284	What happened to England, huh? I got a taste of England when I went to Chicago.
2285	Must have tasted pretty bad for you to come back here and take up with the likes of him.
2286	I'm not taking up with him.
2287	Lily? - If you say so.
2288	- Lily! I am not a kept woman, if that's what you're implying.
2289	So what, you're trading in them satin sheets for a place out here in the muck with the rest of us peons? Lily, it's time for lunch.
2290	Yeah, I'll take that as a no.
2291	Mr Bohannon, has anyone ever told you what an insufferable ass you are? Yeah.
2292	All right, boys, let's get this spur finished.
2293	Hey! That must be some fine tail if you're willing to risk your neck twice for it.
2294	Things is different this time.
2295	Yeah, well, look here.
2296	Durant wants me to ride out with them Yankees and kill the Indians what derailed the train.
2297	Them blue coats get to taking scalps, they liable to cut your rebel hair, too.
2298	I know it.
2299	That's why I'm asking you to ride with me.
2300	You only asking because you still think I owe you.
2301	No.
2302	Our account's square.
2303	I'm asking you because I trust you.
2304	Right now, you're all I got.
2305	No shit.
2306	Walking boss need me.
2307	All right then.
2308	I need to visit in here first.
2309	Don't stay too long just to impress me.
2310	Hey! Pull up your britches and get out.
2311	Give him his money back.
2312	Don't you come in here running off my business.
2313	Woman, I am your business.
2314	:: Is that so? - Yeah, it is.
2315	Well, give me your dang dollar and let's get to it.
2316	- So, I gotta pay you before we start now? - Yeah, that's right.
2317	Because I figure you'll get yourself killed before we even get started.
2318	Uh-uh.
2319	Toole the one that got himself killed.
2320	Oh.
2321	What? So, are you some kind of dangerous gunslinger now? Is that it? Maybe.
2322	I'm fixing to be an Injun fighter, too.
2323	Get out of my crib.
2324	:: What? - you heard me.
2325	I don't want no dead man's trade.
2326	Last I saw you, you barely escaped a neck stretching, and you ride on out of here, and I figured for certain they got you killed.
2327	Now you come back, traipsing on in here like you own the place? I thought you'd be happy to see me.
2328	I am happy to see you, idiot.
2329	I just said so.
2330	Now, give me that damn dollar.
2331	How's your father? Very weak.
2332	You'll have to tend to him.
2333	- Where are you going? - I'm going to help them find my brother.
2334	Your own brother? He has to be stopped before he starts a war.
2335	Be careful, Joseph.
2336	Will you just look at that? An Injun, a nigger and a greyback.
2337	We got ourselves a rainbow, boys.
2338	Mount up.
2339	There's no reason to panic, Lily.
2340	I'm not, Thomas.
2341	I'm simply moving out.
2342	But where will you go? I still have our tent, Robert's and mine.
2343	I'll find a spot.
2344	Are you mad? Living amongst that rabble? And we're under threat of Indian attack.
2345	It's too dangerous.
2346	I won't have it.
2347	That's not your decision to make.
2348	Oh! I see.
2349	I thought it significant that you chose to come back here with me, but I see I was mistaken.
2350	I came back because I believe in you.
2351	I believe in this railroad.
2352	Together, we can get it done.
2353	But not together.
2354	I'm sorry.
2355	Hmm.
2356	So am I.
2357	Taking you in, comforting you, salving the memory of Robert at every turn.
2358	And for that, I am eternally grateful.
2359	Please, Thomas, can we end this amiably? You played me like a fiddle, didn't you? Right under my nose, where I could see you, hear your voice, smell you every day.
2360	I should go.
2361	Could you have Henri help me with my things? No.
2362	Carry them yourself.
2363	Hold! We follow Little Bear Creek north for a day, then head west.
2364	How many in your father's camp? Fifty, maybe 60.
2365	Mostly women and children.
2366	:: Where are all the braves? - Out hunting.
2367	What about this Pawnee Killer? My father will know where he is.
2368	He better.
2369	Think that was smart, telling him there's only women and children at that camp? What do you mean? What if your father don't give up Pawnee Killer? Lieutenant Griggs gave me his guarantee.
2370	So the white man gave you his word, huh? Lieutenant? - How we doing? - Fine.
2371	Is that a Confederate sabre you got on your belt there? Yes, it is.
2372	Where'd you get it? Antietam.
2373	Spoils of victory.
2374	You call Sharpsburg a victory? Antietam.
2375	And, yeah, I do, a glorious one.
2376	Mount up! That'll be six bits.
2377	Six bits? Seventy-five cents, unless Unless you got something else in mind.
2378	What are you doing? - You can put it on my account.
2379	:: all Right, Eva.
2380	I'll be back for it later.
2381	You know where I'll be.
2382	Now fly.
2383	:: Thank You.
2384	I'll pay you back.
2385	:: When? I have a small purse of coins somewhere.
2386	Yeah, don't worry about it for now.
2387	First thing I'd do is get you a carpenter to lay you some floor boards.
2388	Otherwise, you'll be saying hello to Mr Trench Foot.
2389	I'm well acquainted with trench foot.
2390	I have spent a year in the wilderness.
2391	I reckon you're a good sight tougher than you look, ain't you, Mrs Bell? - Please.
2392	Lily.
2393	:: all Right then, Lily.
2394	I'd still suggest you putting in them floor boards, though.
2395	Course, I had to throw my leg over that cross-eyed carpenter twice before he got mine right.
2396	Tell us about your glorious victory at Sharpsburg, Lieutenant.
2397	Antietam it is, then.
2398	I was with the 51 st Pennsylvania.
2399	Me and my boys took the Burnside bridge.
2400	We softened them Rebs up with a light howitzer from the east bank.
2401	Then we stormed that bridge like hounds from hell.
2402	Should have seen them greybacks run.
2403	Yes, sir.
2404	Them boys got the skinny end of the horn that day.
2405	I was on the other side of the bridge that day.
2406	Is that so? Yep.
2407	You want to know why we retreated? We was out of ammunition from killing Yankees.
2408	Now, don't get me wrong, they were some brave men.
2409	Brave men.
2410	General McClellan might just as well have been sending them up against a firing squad.
2411	They kept charging, we kept shooting, like fish in a bloody barrel.
2412	Time we was done, there was a bridge of bodies across that river.
2413	Yeah.
2414	That must have been when you finally come across.
2415	When all the killing was done.
2416	Yeah.
2417	We must've put down 500 Yankees that day.
2418	So You want to call that a glorious victory, you go ahead.
2419	Five hundred, it doesn't matter.
2420	Hey.
2421	Hey! We won.
2422	And you lost.
2423	And I got the sword right here to prove it.
2424	Yeah.
2425	Well, I guess I'm just gonna have to take it off you - And shove it up your ass, then.
2426	:: Yeah, Is that so? Listen to me.
2427	Listen to me.
2428	Sometimes you gotta bite your tongue and just take it.
2429	Jesus.
2430	Get up! Hey, hey, get up! Jensen! Jensen! Jensen! Sweet Jesus.
2431	:: they took the horses.
2432	:: What? Damn it to hell.
2433	That damned father of yours is pretty clever, I'll give him that much.
2434	My father had nothing to do with this.
2435	It was my brother.
2436	:: your brother? - this Is his work.
2437	What we saw out there, too.
2438	This bloody renegade is your brother, and you expect me to act fairly with your father? Hey! We got more important problems.
2439	:: as in we got No horses.
2440	- Yeah, I'm aware of that.
2441	We need to turn around and go back.
2442	The plan's unchanged.
2443	We march into the village.
2444	March? Are you crazy or just stupid? You are welcome to retreat, Mr Bohannon.
2445	We don't need you.
2446	Let's move out.
2447	Off the reel, gentlemen.
2448	We need to go back.
2449	Following this guy's gonna be suicide.
2450	No.
2451	We split up, we'll be easier targets.
2452	It's what my brother wants.
2453	Hey.
2454	Hey! I need to know where you stand right now.
2455	How you mean? Pawnee Killer's fighting a rear guard action, trying to buy some time for his village, which means they ain't left yet.
2456	What if we get there and them Injuns still here? Griggs ain't gonna be in no talking mood, that's for sure.
2457	Well, I sure as hell ain't gonna kill no women and no children.
2458	You just be ready.
2459	We might end up fighting them blue coats instead of the Cheyenne.
2460	Father? I brought you some soup.
2461	Mother told me this was always your one true love.
2462	I was only little, but I remember the screaming at night.
2463	I remember the bruises on her face in the morning.
2464	After you left, she was always afraid you'd come back, but never stopped praying you would.
2465	She never stopped loving you.
2466	Have you nothing to say? Leave me alone.
2467	No.
2468	You're the one who leaves, remember? Here, let me.
2469	Here, drink it.
2470	I am not my mother.
2471	I'm not afraid of you.
2472	What the hell are you up to, son? - What do you mean? - It's just a different bend in the same river.
2473	Skirted it twice now, back out, back in.
2474	Pawnee Killer would have had time to tell your father about the derailment by now.
2475	You're just buying time for your village to escape, ain't you? What do you care? You gonna get the rest of us killed out here, leading us in circles.
2476	That's a risk I'm willing to take.
2477	So you never intended to go after Pawnee Killer, did you? That's not true.
2478	I just wanted to make sure my family was safe first.
2479	Hey! Why the hell you dragging ass? We need to stick together.
2480	Hold your fire.
2481	Hold your fire! You're just wasting ammunition.
2482	- Why ain't they attacking us? - They will.
2483	Sooner or later.
2484	This is my favorite day of the week, other than Monday, when I give my patooty a rest.
2485	Hey, don't be shy, Deuce.
2486	Hello.
2487	Oh! The ladies call me Deuce because I got two of them.
2488	Thank you, Deuce.
2489	Hello.
2490	Everybody stares at my tattoos, but nobody asks.
2491	And, yeah, it don't wipe off.
2492	Yes, I heard you were captured by Indians.
2493	Yavapai.
2494	Came upon us from the grass.
2495	It was a sunny day.
2496	They hacked up my mom and dad, scalped them.
2497	Raped my little sister and smashed her brains out with rocks.
2498	You gonna eat that? No, please.
2499	But I was lucky.
2500	I had the pox.
2501	They wouldn't touch me, traded me off to some Mojave.
2502	They was a cake walk compared to what the Yavapai would have been.
2503	I have these terrible nightmares about the Indian I killed.
2504	It's because his spirit's wandering.
2505	- It's reaching out to you.
2506	:: Yes.
2507	Yes, and in the dream, he His cold hands clutch at my ankles.
2508	Don't let him get you.
2509	He's trying to drag you onto the path to the dead world.
2510	:: it seems So real When it happens.
2511	:: it Is real.
2512	When a woman kills a brave, it invites big magic.
2513	Especially a white woman.
2514	If the Indians don't attack us tonight, I want to start work again tomorrow.
2515	Mr Durant, Bohannon is a killer.
2516	I can prove it.
2517	Yeah? Look at these papers I found in his tent.
2518	Right now, Mr Bohannon is hunting the Indians who attacked us.
2519	:: your job Is to Get the men back to work.
2520	:: Yeah, Yeah.
2521	In Washington.
2522	In Washington, he killed.
2523	Now, Johnson knew he killed, so he killed Johnson.
2524	:: Mr Gundersen.
2525	:: Mmm? we will post a relay of sentries Out to the cut.
2526	Arm everyone.
2527	:: the work must continue.
2528	:: No.
2529	He is not done killing.
2530	Now look at this.
2531	He's looking for others among us.
2532	Look at these names.
2533	Listen to me.
2534	Half the men out there are killers.
2535	Half of them are accomplices.
2536	They are all afraid of Bohannon.
2537	He is an agent of progress, an asset to me in this endeavor.
2538	Whatever his motivations.
2539	Now you will feed this fantasy of revenge into the stove.
2540	Tomorrow, God willing, we will resume work on my railroad.
2541	Yeah.
2542	Mr Durant.
2543	It's a long walk through Indian territory to Sweden, Mr Gundersen.
2544	Sweden? I am from Norway.
2545	I am Norwegian.
2546	# These 20 acres and one ginny mule # From the Alabama Trust Ow! # Half of the cotton # Third of the corn # Get a handful of dust # We cannot have all things to please us # No matter how we try # Until we've all gone to Jesus # We can only wonder why # I had a daughter, called her Annabelle # She's the apple of my eye # Tried to give her something like I never had # Didn't want to ever hear her cry # We cannot have all things to please us Lily? # No matter how we try Lily? # Until we've all gone to Jesus # We can only wonder why # They're gone.
2547	:: Looks like we just missed them, sir.
2548	:: you son of a bitch.
2549	You knew this was gonna happen.
2550	You planned this with your brother, didn't you? SOLDIER: Lieutenant! He's just a kid.
2551	No!.
2552	# Cold is the water # It freezes your already cold mind # Already cold, cold mind # And death is at your doorstep # And it will steal your innocence # But it will not steal your substance # But you are not alone in this # And you are not alone in this # As brothers we will stand # And we'll hold your hand # Hold your hand # And you are the mother # The mother of your baby child # The one to whom you gave life # And you have your choices # And these are what make man great # His ladder to the stars # But you are not alone in this # And you are not alone in this # As brothers we will stand # And we'll hold your hand # Hold your hand # But you are not alone in this # And you are not alone in this # As brothers we will stand # And we'll hold your hand # Hold your hand # But I will tell the night # And whisper,  Lose your sight  # But I can't move the mountains # For you # Yes, I know this area quite well.
2553	As I remember, Robert warned you about laying track here because this area was prone to washouts.
2554	Robert was right.
2555	I was wrong.
2556	Is that what you need to hear? Well, I've said it.
2557	Now, this section needs to be re-surveyed and re-built.
2558	Can you do it? Yes.
2559	But it'll have to be re-routed south as Robert intended.
2560	Do you see this ridge? This is solid bedrock.
2561	Yes, but that'll take longer.
2562	You'll have to have your men work faster, Doc.
2563	You get paid to build 40 miles of useable road.
2564	If you build here again, it will get washed out again.
2565	:: Well, it may not rain again for months Or - Those are my terms.
2566	Of course, you could always find another surveyor Somewhere.
2567	Excuse me.
2568	GRIGGS: Black Moon, you're gonna answer for this, you know that.
2569	I should have let my brother kill you.
2570	:: you should try Right now.
2571	Hey! We've had enough killing for one day.
2572	I don't suppose either of you are keen on joining me? To do what? What I came for.
2573	You'll never find them.
2574	We'll see about that.
2575	They know that you're following them.
2576	They'll kill the both of you.
2577	Yeah, we'll see about that, too.
2578	Last chance, Bohannon.
2579	I figured.
2580	What about you? You don't need his permission.
2581	He's nobody's master anymore.
2582	Go if you're going.
2583	Mr Bohannon, you have to finish this.
2584	What are you talking about? This.
2585	What you came to do.
2586	We came to kill the bastards who derailed the train.
2587	We got 'em.
2588	No one's gonna believe you unless you have proof.
2589	You mean scalps? They're just gonna have to take my word for it.
2590	I ain't bringing back proof.
2591	Not even for $20 a head? Seems a shame leaving all this money lying around here for the buzzards, don't you think? My brother belongs to me.
2592	Don't look at me.
2593	I'm a sinner, Ruth.
2594	You know that better than anyone, don't you? - Father? - No.
2595	You let me finish.
2596	I've been wrasslin' with God, Ruth.
2597	And I honestly believe that I was chosen for a great mission.
2598	And that's why I left.
2599	But you failed.
2600	No, I'd like to think that my work with John Brown may have helped in some small way to free the slaves.
2601	I didn't say John Brown failed.
2602	I said you failed.
2603	One drop of love That's all we needed.
2604	One drop of love would have sustained us.
2605	Now, Ruth, I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.
2606	Don't you walk away from me! Praise his name, sister.
2607	Praise his name.
2608	Praise! The McGinnes Brothers Magic Lantern Show.
2609	Back in business! You know what we forgot, Seano? We forgot to get a new sign.

2611	Painter's due in an hour.
2612	:: have the new sign by nightfall.
2613	Nell! Nell! A word! Now that is a fine door-ful of a woman.
2614	Nell, you know we have an agreement.
2615	Nobody's working, Swede.
2616	When nobody works, nobody gets paid.
2617	If nobody gets paid, then nobody comes to see my Son of a bitch.
2618	Now, we have an agreement.
2619	There's a better way, Brother.
2620	Straight and steady, please, sir.
2621	Yes, ma'am.

2628	I thought you should know.
2629	So Robert's death has been avenged.
2630	I'd hoped it would close the hole I feel in my heart.
2631	Ain't nothing gonna close that, ma'am.
2632	:: Very impressive, Mr - Ferguson.
2633	Elam Ferguson.
2634	I suppose Mr Bohannon sent you to collect the bounty.

2641	Would you like a drink? I ain't too much of a drinking man.
2642	Well, a cigar, perhaps? Thank you.
2643	Well, please sit.
2644	You strike me as a capable man.
2645	I know which end is up.
2646	Well, that is good to know.
2647	Because I am always on the lookout for a man willing to get his hands dirty from time to time.
2648	A man who's willing to do things off the books, as it were.
2649	Mmm.
2650	I'm looking for a man who wants to be feared and respected.
2651	A man trying to improve his station in life.
2652	Oh, you slay me, honey.

2669	Let me show you the hole.
2670	Please, Mr Ferguson.
2671	Bear witness to a miracle.
2672	As I wandered in the wilderness, like our Lord himself, I came face to face with me ignorance and cruelty towards you.
2673	And I swore to God almighty that if I survived, I would come to you on bended knee and beg for your forgiveness.
2674	Not me.
2675	Her.

2711	:: He takes a cut? - And then some.
2712	What you want me to do about it, Sean? Here's the thing.
2713	We're not the only ones being preyed upon.
2714	All the merchants of Hell on Wheels are paying him off.
2715	So? So We took up a collection.
2716	Everybody pitched in.

2721	I happen to know The Swede's been stealing from Durant.
2722	Dig you up some dirt on him, and Durant will ride him out of town on a rail.
2723	For free.
2724	Ask me to sit down.

2731	You ain't much of a drinking man, is you? Gave it up.
2732	Why is that? Last time I got drunk, I got into something bad.
2733	Listen, I need to ask you something.
2734	You know that bidness we had to attend to? You good with that? I'm better than good.
2735	Bout time I be the one who gets to do the hurting.
2736	Besides, seem Mr Durant done took a liking to my work.
2737	He say he might just call on me when need be.
2738	Durant? Better watch yourself.
2739	That's a slick slope you're heading down.
2740	Hmm.
2741	Slick with blood.
2742	Somebody else's, for a change.
2743	For somebody who don't drink, you're putting that down pretty good.
2744	Ladies and gentlemen, take your glasses in hand for a toast to the great Indian killers who have made our home a safe place to work and drink! Shut up! Listen up.
2745	I want y'all to get a good night's sleep.
2746	Tomorrow, we hit that 40-mile marker, and I'm gonna work y'all like mongrel dogs.
2747	It's gonna get built, gentlemen.
2748	And we're just the bastards to build it.
2749	Senator.
2750	I'm glad you are here to witness such a momentous feat.
2751	No, you're not.
2752	You're only interested in our quid pro quo.
2753	If you insist.
2754	I had the Pinkertons track down the Illinois man you were looking for.
2755	Whereabouts of Sergeant Frank Harper.
2756	Seems he's holed up at a trading post near Council Bluffs.
2757	Your brother was the runt of the litter.
2758	Smaller than all the other boys.
2759	They picked on him and teased him.
2760	He was always in a fight, but he never backed down.
2761	It made him strong.
2762	It made him a great warrior.
2763	But not a great man.
2764	He never learned, as you did, that sometimes it's better not to fight, and other times, you must fight the ones you love.
2765	When I saw what you were wearing, when I saw what you had prepared for your brother, I hoped that you would return to me.
2766	But now, I see in your eyes you are becoming your own man.
2767	And so today, I mourn for one son, Pawnee Killer.
2768	And I mourn the loss of my other son, Black Moon, which hurts me so much more.
2769	That's it, boys, almost there! This is it right here! This is your marker! We're gonna make it.
2770	Now put your backs into it.
2771	Pick it up, boys! I want them next two rails laid in the next five minutes.
2772	Pick up the pace.
2773	We run out of flanges again, I'll skin the runner alive! MICKEY: Hold the spike, would you.
2774	Hold the spike.
2775	Well, jeez! Three, two, one.
2776	That's it, boys, almost there.
2777	Break time's over.
2778	Back to work.
2779	Don't bloody look at it, sink! Nail crew, just get 'em nailed in! Clean-up crew, finish it.
2780	That's it.
2781	Back into it.
2782	Almost there! You embarrass me now, boys, and I'll skin the lot of ya.
2783	Let's go! Hold! Down.

2799	LILY: Fine.
2800	Brandy would be fine.
2801	It's on me.
2802	May I? By all means.
2803	Thank you.
2804	Not good? I've had better.
2805	Yeah.
2806	Well, you did it, 40 miles.
2807	You said you would, and you did.
2808	First time in my life.
2809	Failed as a tobacco farmer, lost a war, now I'm a railroad man.
2810	Maybe third time's the charm, huh? Maybe.
2811	That first night we met, you told me I had no idea who you was or what you was capable of, and you was right.
2812	I thought you were some spoiled limey brat.
2813	Yeah, I guess I got you wrong, huh? Well, what do you think of me now, Mr Bohannon? Mrs Bell! Mr Bohannon! Doing a little celebrating? Well, you both deserve it.
2814	What you did today was historic.
2815	Thank you, Thomas.
2816	Will you join us? I would love to, but there are a few issues outstanding that I need to discuss with my foreman.
2817	Excuse me.
2818	Black Moon.
2819	You in here? Black Moon? You made me a pledge.
2820	You told me you would win this war called the Union Pacific.
2821	Today, you won a major battle.
2822	You're a man of your word.
2823	Thank you, sir.
2824	I wanted to both congratulate you and offer you a bonus.
2825	Oh! I don't need any more money, sir.
2826	It's not that kind of bonus, Mr Bohannon.
2827	It's much more valuable than money.
2828	Information.
2829	You You're Lieutenant Griggs, from the cavalry.
2830	:: I heard about You.
2831	:: Yeah? Well, I heard Black Moon was living in here.
2832	You feel that Joseph led you astray? He needs to be made accountable.
2833	You know, The Swede has been, shall we say, focused on you for some time.
2834	:: like a hound got the scent.
2835	:: Mmm.
2836	He just sent a wire to the federal marshals in Washington, D.
2837	C.
2838	Claims he has evidence linking you to several murders back east.
2839	You a family man, Lieutenant? Do you have a wife and children? I mean, what if someone killed your son and scalped your daughter and raped your wife? Would you stand idly by? They'll be coming to arrest you.
2840	You telling me all this 'cause you want me to run, Mr Durant? I'm giving you a chance to save yourself, Bohannon.
2841	I don't know, could you Could you find it in your heart to forgive him? Is he here? Not now.
2842	Sure, I'll forgive him.
2843	Right after I kill him.
2844	We're We're all held accountable, you know, one way or another.
2845	Mary! I asked you here today to acknowledge the exceptional work you've done.
2846	We could not have come this far without you.
2847	Now tonight at the 40-mile celebration, we shall have the pleasure of entertaining senators, investors and sundry other dignitaries.
2848	And since we are in such short supply of ladies of repute, you will all be invited to the dance.
2849	Ooh.
2850	All right.
2851	But you will have to make yourselves presentable and behave like the proper ladies I know you can pretend to be.
2852	But I warn you, pick pockets, blushingtons, bug hunters will be severely dealt with.
2853	Now, go clean yourselves up.
2854	Boys? How we doing? Getting ready for the dance.
2855	Listen.
2856	Y'all been tailing Swede like I told you? We have.
2857	But to no avail.
2858	He's a slippery bastard, that one.
2859	He rode out of town last night.
2860	You know where he went? No.
2861	But he bought two bottles of whiskey at the Starlight before he left.
2862	Must be going on a bender.
2863	Swede don't drink.
2864	Then I guess he's meeting someone who does.
2865	I wasn't there that night.
2866	Check the date on my discharge.
2867	I was wounded at Starkville two weeks before Meridian.
2868	Then how could you know what happened that night.
2869	I stayed in touch with Johnson and the boys after the war.
2870	They told me all about it.
2871	And you can still testify as to why Bohannon had motive to kill Johnson and this other man.
2872	You think I'm crazy? He already tried to kill me once.
2873	He'll finish the job if I go back there.
2874	This man, he's not going to give up.
2875	And you can keep running, but one day he just gonna show up on your doorstep and kill you dead.
2876	Now, let's finish this thing, huh? Now.
2877	Hey.
2878	:: that whiskey goes in the dance tent.
2879	:: Yes, sir.
2880	Not in your tent.
2881	I'm going to check 'em later, make sure they ain't light one or two bottles.
2882	LILY: Damn it all! Right.
2883	You having trouble with your floorboards, ma'am? Well, you're very perceptive, aren't you? I'm afraid I'm not much of a carpenter.
2884	No, ma'am, you ain't.
2885	Could you possibly help me? That is, if you're not busy killing anyone.
2886	Well, sure as heck can't do any worse.
2887	Great.
2888	You're quite handy with a hammer and a nail.
2889	Were you really a farmer before the war? Is that so hard to believe? Yes, actually.
2890	I find it hard to imagine you in a domestic setting.
2891	I couldn't either.
2892	I always had one eye on the door.
2893	So you were married.
2894	Was.
2895	Had a son, too.
2896	War come along and jumped at the chance.
2897	Mary didn't want me to go but She didn't stand in my way, either.
2898	Now I'd give anything to be home and just So you lost them both? Your wife and your son.
2899	I'm so sorry.
2900	It's all right.
2901	That about does it here.
2902	Wait.
2903	Please, I'm sorry.
2904	I didn't mean to upset you.
2905	Please, don't Whatever happened to your wife and son, please don't let it kill the man they loved.
2906	Sorry, Mrs Bell.
2907	It's too late for that.
2908	Mr Durant.
2909	I thought you'd be well on your way by now.
2910	Decided to stay.
2911	Is that wise? I ain't never been accused of being wise, sir.
2912	So we'll see you at the dance tonight? You will if I'm there.
2913	Special ordered from New York.
2914	Oh, Thomas.
2915	I cannot accept this.
2916	Oh, it's not a gift.
2917	Think of it as payment.
2918	For what? I've invited many potential investors to the celebration this evening.
2919	What does that have to do with me? It's become clear to me that this railroad could do with a face, other than my own, associated with it.
2920	You're thinking of the fair-haired maiden of the west.
2921	Yes.
2922	You think she'll lure the investors.
2923	Like moths to a flame, my dear.
2924	I'll consider it.
2925	On one condition.
2926	Why is nothing ever elemental with you? I want to be a part of it.
2927	Part of what? The building of this road.
2928	I want to see it through to the end.
2929	Do we have a deal? Your condition is accepted, madam.
2930	Sorry.
2931	I don't I don't mean to disturb your prayers, preacher.
2932	How can I help you, son? Well, I'm on a dark path, sir.
2933	Been on it for a while now.
2934	Where does the dark path lead? More blood.
2935	More hatred.
2936	I met somebody who reached out to me and asked me to turn away from the darkness.
2937	Been wanting to preach to me, so here's your chance.
2938	Well, there is a God.
2939	Of that I have no doubt.
2940	But there's a There's a devil, too.
2941	And you know what that old devil did? You want me to tell you about that? Yeah.
2942	Yeah? Well, that devil, he cut off God's arms.
2943	And he hacked off God's legs.
2944	And he gouged out his eyes, ripped out his tongue, and left him lying there in a bloody heap on the floor.
2945	But he left God's ears so he could hear us down here when we're wailing and thrashing and praying for his help.
2946	But, brother, there ain't a damn thing God can do to help us.
2947	What are you saying, preacher? Just choose hate.
2948	It's so much easier.
2949	Brother! Choose hate.
2950	I thought everybody was supposed to have the day off.
2951	Everybody but us.
2952	We had no say in it, neither.
2953	Want me to talk to Durant about it? You shittin' in some mighty high cotton ain't you, boy? Watch yourself, Psalms.
2954	I'm still your boss.
2955	Who do you think you is in these fancy clothes, huh? Who cocked your hat, boy? You did.
2956	Ain't supposed to be our boss.
2957	You're supposed to be our leader.
2958	Thinking you looking out for us.
2959	Turn out you just looking out for your own damn self.
2960	Ain't nobody else gonna do it.
2961	I ain't your master.
2962	You need to look you for your own self, huh? Carlton.
2963	Cullen.
2964	Mr Bohannon.
2965	Been looking everywhere for you.
2966	What's going on, Sean? I'm just making plans for The Swede.
2967	He's just rolled back in, and he wasn't alone.
2968	Oh, yeah? Who'she with? Well, I didn't hear any names.
2969	But he had a on a Union jacket with sergeant stripes.
2970	Sergeant's jacket, huh? Yeah, I think so.
2971	Look, I know we've had our difference You sure you saw sergeant stripes? Yes! Where they at? Where they at? Where they at? Swede's caboose.
2972	Will this make us even for the fight? Bohannon.
2973	A couple of federal marshals are coming to arrest me tonight.
2974	For what? Murder.
2975	So why ain't you just up and left? Sergeant's here.
2976	Swede tracked him down.
2977	I reckon he talked him into testifying against me.
2978	How you know Harper will be the man you're looking for? - He has to be.
2979	- You don't know that.
2980	What the hell is your stake in all this? I ain't got none.
2981	Why do you even care? You told me something once.
2982	It was the only thing that ever set me free.
2983	Yeah, what's that? You got to let go of the past.
2984	You will be the king of the ball.
2985	Unfortunately with no queen by my side.
2986	:: Oh, you refer to Mrs Lily Bell? - Mmm.
2987	Sir, shall we take a walk? Mr Gundersen, have you ever had your heart ripped out by a woman? I was married once, sir, but she ran off with a gypsy.
2988	My heart was not ripped out, but she did steal my cuckoo clock.
2989	Well, my gypsy is Bohannon.
2990	Loki, yeah.
2991	:: What? - So He And Mrs Lily Bell.
2992	I gave him a chance to run, but he wouldn't take it.
2993	Run? But why? Mr Gundersen, I told him about the federal marshals.
2994	He knows you're up to something.
2995	Oh! Why did you tell him? I wanted to get rid of him.
2996	The fool wouldn't leave.
2997	Why are you telling me this now? Because I want you to succeed in your plan, Mr Gundersen.
2998	Mmm.
2999	You need to get out of here.
3000	:: now.
3001	- Why? He's coming.
3002	:: find a place to hide.
3003	- Where? - I don't want to know.
3004	- Why not? So Bohannon can't get it out of me.
3005	Now, listen, no matter what, you must meet that train.
3006	And when it arrive, the marshals will protect you.
3007	Where is he? Where is who? In the myths of my homeland, there is a God who go by the name of Loki.
3008	This Loki is the God of Chaos.
3009	He cause nothing but trouble everywhere he go.
3010	No matter how hard the other gods try to catch him, the slippery little devil always manages to escape.
3011	You have three seconds to tell me where he is.
3012	I honestly do not know.
3013	If I did, I would not tell you.
3014	Go ahead, kill me.
3015	I go to my grave happy knowing that I'm the one who'll bring you down.
3016	Just as I thought.
3017	Killing me does not equate in your moral mathematics.
3018	Eva! Hooee! Darling.
3019	If you ain't slicker than a fine gentleman's snot rag.
3020	You ain't looking too shabby your own self, gal.
3021	Thank you.
3022	Where'd you get that pretty thing? Mrs Bell gave it to me.
3023	What you doing out here? They're building a town.
3024	A real town.
3025	I've been on the move for as long as I can remember.
3026	Since before them injuns took me.
3027	I was thinking it might be nice for us to, you know, settle down.
3028	What you mean? Well, we're getting hitched, so why not settle down like a proper man and wife - And raise a family.
3029	:: Getting hitched? like we talked about.
3030	I ain't never said nothing about getting hitched.
3031	But I I thought the other day you said that you wanted me to be yours.
3032	I do.
3033	Well, I thought that meant I just ain't thought things out that far.
3034	And I sure as hell ain't staying in no podunk railroad town.
3035	Look at me.
3036	When they freed me, I ain't have a penny to my name, Eva.
3037	And now I work for Mr Thomas Durant hisself.
3038	Oh! I see.
3039	For the first time in my life, I got money in my pocket.
3040	My money in my pocket.
3041	Might be looking at some kind of real future.
3042	:: Without me? - No.
3043	I want it with you.
3044	What, as your private whore? You're here.
3045	Good to see you.
3046	Good to see you.
3047	Imagine it.
3048	A journey that now takes six months will be cut to seven days.
3049	Seven days.
3050	It boggles the mind.
3051	You will be able to spend Christmas in New York and And New Year's in San Francisco.
3052	Gentlemen, I give you Mrs Lily Bell.
3053	- Ma'am.
3054	:: Mrs Bell.
3055	Is there room on your dance card? Evening, Miss Eva.
3056	Mr Toole.
3057	Are you not waiting for Mr Ferguson? No, I am not.
3058	Ma'am, if I'm not overstepping me bounds, would you do me the honor of dancing with me? I'm sorry, Mr Toole.
3059	I don't much feel like dancing right now.
3060	I understand.
3061	Thank you, ma'am.
3062	Mr Toole.
3063	There was a time out in the frontier with Robert when I wondered if this beautiful landscape might not be better unspoilt.
3064	Part of me still wonders that.
3065	But after seeing all these people working so hard to build this road, after understanding the sheer audacity of this American endeavor, well, I see now there truly is greatness in it.
3066	To Lily Bell, the fair-haired maiden of the west.
3067	:: Cheers.
3068	:: Hear, hear.
3069	You following me? Oh, no.
3070	No, sir.
3071	Just taking the evening air.
3072	What is this? It's about a payment.
3073	No, not now.
3074	Hey! Hey! Get your bloody rope off me! Son of a bitch! Get your bloody hands off me! Your bloody hands off me! We're here to collect a debt, Mr Swede.
3075	You be careful, Irish boy, what you choose to do now, son of a bitch.
3076	Bloody How do you like that? Bust his head! Bastard! Get your hand off me, bloody Irish.
3077	Bloody! Would you like to dance, sir? I'm sure some of these other fellows are much better dancers than me.
3078	But I don't want these other fellows.
3079	You'll see a lot of perks working for me, Mr Ferguson.
3080	Is that right? Mmm-hmm.
3081	Excuse me a second.
3082	Ah Elam! What the hell are you doing with my woman? - Hey, now, Ferguson.
3083	:: Stop it, Elam.
3084	Let him go.
3085	Come on, Elam.
3086	I ain't your woman.
3087	You made that pretty clear.
3088	I didn't make nothing clear.
3089	You're still mine.
3090	What, like your property? I'm staying behind, Elam.
3091	It seems like Mr Toole has got the same idea.
3092	You and him? No, there ain't no me and him.
3093	We're just two people who don't want to be vagabonds no more.
3094	I love you, Elam, but I'm tired of being a tramp.
3095	Excuse me.
3096	Sorry, I'm afraid I need to cut in.
3097	Damn it.
3098	You don't have to do this.
3099	I wasn't there, Mr Bohannon.
3100	You're a liar.
3101	Johnson said the sergeant strangled my wife.
3102	And I saw the picture.
3103	:: you was the platoon sergeant.
3104	- Not then, I wasn't.
3105	You raped and murdered my wife.
3106	I wasn't there.
3107	:: just admit it.
3108	:: I can prove it.
3109	No.
3110	You have to be him.
3111	I can prove it.
3112	Hey.
3113	I've been looking for you.
3114	I seen the marshals back there.
3115	Hmm.
3116	You killed him? Yeah.
3117	But he wasn't there.
3118	I killed the wrong man.

00002	Calm down.
00003	Man: What are you waiting for? They are barbarians.
00004	A guy steals a goat from another guy
00005	And so they had to tear each other before you knew it.
00006	I have never seen wanders like this.
00007	Even my life has never seen anything like this.
00008	How close to the scene?
00009	- the closest possible. - We should go back to the Wall.
00010	Do the corpses scare you?
00011	Our command is to hunt down the wanderers.
00012	We have searched them. They will not cause trouble for me anymore.
00013	Do not you think they will ask us how they die?
00014	Go horseback riding.
00015	Those who killed them can kill us.
00016	That even killed children.
00017	It is good that we are not children.
00018	If you want to run south, keep running.
00019	Of course they will chase you like a fugitive
00020	If I do not catch you first.
00021	Go horseback riding.
00022	I do not repeat it.
00023	Look at your bodies have moved the camp.
00024	They were here.
00025	Find out where they went.
00026	What is this?
00027	It...
00028	Hurry, Daddy is looking.
00029	And mother too.
00030	Well done.
00031	Thank you.
00032	And who among you are gunners at the age of 10?
00033	Keep practicing, Bran.
00034	Hurry up.
00035	Do not think too much, Bran.
00036	Release the bow handle.
00037	Bring up Bran!
00038	Sir Stark!
00039	Ladies and gentlemen.
00040	The cavalry just patrolled the hills.
00041	They have arrested a fugitive from the group.
00042	Call people to prepare horses.
00043	Do you have to?
00044	He has already vowed, Cat.
00045	Law is the law, lady.
00046	Tell Bran that it follows.
00047	Ned.
00048	10 years old is too small to see the scene.
00049	It can not always be a child.
00050	And winter is coming.
00051	Everyone is back.
00052	White Ball.
00053	I have seen the White Ball.
00054	White Ball.
00055	I have seen them.
00056	I know I broke my vow.
00057	And I know now I'm a fugitive.
00058	I should have returned to the Wall and informed them, but ...
00059	I saw them.
00060	I have seen the White Ball.
00061	People need to know about this.
00062	If you could pass my word to my family ...
00063	Tell them I'm not a coward.
00064	Tell them I'm sorry.
00065	Please forgive me.
00066	On behalf of Robert Baratheon
00067	- The name of the person ... - Do not turn your head.
00068	- ... The King Of Andals And The First ...
00069	You will know if you turn away.
00070	... King of 7 Doors and is the protector of the kingdom,
00071	I, Eddard of the Stark House
00072	Winterfell's lord and guardian of the North
00073	execute you here.
00074	Good job.
00075	I understand why we do?
00076	Jon says he's a fugitive.
00077	But do you understand why I have to kill him myself?
00078	Our way of doing things is ancient.
00079	Who gave the order
00080	he must be the hand.
00081	Did he really see the White Ball?
00082	White shadows have disappeared thousands of years ago.
00083	So he lied?
00084	Crazy people look at what they want to see.
00085	What is this?
00086	Mountain Lion?
00087	There is no lion in the forest.
00088	What is that!
00089	Snowflakes.
00090	This animal is pretty.
00091	There was no wolf in the south of the Wall.
00092	There are five children.
00093	Want to keep it?
00094	Where will they go?
00095	Their mother died.
00096	They do not belong here.
00097	Kill them away is better.
00098	Without mother, they can not live
00099	- Give it to me. - Are not!
00100	Put the knife away.
00101	I received orders from your father, not you.
00102	- Daddy, please! - I'm sorry, Bran.
00103	Sir Stark?
00104	There are 5 baby wolves ...
00105	Each child is dedicated to a child of the Stark family.
00106	Snowflakes are your family's crest.
00107	Your son is their master.
00108	You will train yourself.
00109	I myself feed him.
00110	And if it's dead, you'll have to bury it.
00111	And you?
00112	You are not the Stark family.
00113	Hold on.
00114	What?
00115	This guy is so fast ... That's mine.
00116	As my brother, my responsibility is to inform you that:
00117	I worry too much.
00118	- Start showing your face. - And he never lied about anything.
00119	When I was 7, I jumped from the cliffs of Mount Casterly,
00120	The guy down to the sea below 100 feet
00121	and he was not afraid.
00122	Until you tell me your father.
00123	We are the Lannisters. Lannisters do not behave like idiots.
00124	How did Jon Arryn talk to anyone?
00125	But who can he speak to?
00126	- My husband. - If he told the king, my head
00127	Now it's plugged in and hung in front of the city.
00128	Even if Jon knew or did not know, he died.
00129	And Robert would choose a King's Hand ... someone else would do his job
00130	while he continues to play pigs and poachers ...
00131	Looks like the opposite?
00132	And life goes on.
00133	You should be the King's Hand.
00134	It was an honor that he did not need.
00135	Their days are too long
00136	Their network is too short.
00137	How many years
00138	and I still find myself outside
00139	every time you come here
00140	She has five children in the North.
00141	She is not an outsider.
00142	I wonder if the former gods agree not.
00143	Be your god with their rules.
00144	I'm sorry.
00145	- Tell me. - A crow from King's Landing.
00146	Jon Arryn passed away.
00147	A fever took his life.
00148	He knew he was like a father to him.
00149	- His brother, baby? - They are still healthy
00150	The gods are still very kind.
00151	One more news ...
00152	The house is approaching Winterfell ...
00153	With the queen
00154	and the whole goddess.
00155	If he goes to the far north ...
00156	He's only for one thing.
00157	You can say no, Ned.
00158	We will need a lot of candles for the room of the Tyrion lord.
00159	I was told he reads all night.
00160	I was told he was drinking all night.
00161	Who can he bend? Someone like him ...
00162	We brought eight barrels of wine from the basement.
00163	- Maybe we will know how much he is drinking. - Anyway
00164	add candles.
00165	Why is your mother forced us to be so beautiful when the king's debut?
00166	For the queen, I bet. Where she eats white dress slippery
00167	I also heard that the prince was a guy.
00168	Think of all the girls in the South
00169	was sleeping with him.
00170	Do go tommy, cut him beautiful up.
00171	He never met a girl better than her own hair.
00172	They grow too fast.
00173	Brandon!
00174	I saw the king. He has a hundred followers.
00175	How many times have you told your child not to climb?
00176	But he is coming here right on our way.
00177	I want you to promise me
00178	is not climbing anymore.
00179	I promise.
00180	- What do you know? - What?
00181	You always look down before you lie
00182	Lama looking for father and son. Tell him the king is coming.
00183	Where is Arya? Sansa, where are you?
00184	What is this eagle in the head for?
00185	- Go in the cargo
00186	Go!
00187	Electricity.
00188	You seem to gain weight.
00189	- Cat! - Dear power.
00190	Nine years ... Why can not I see you? What are you pulling out?
00191	Keep the North for you, dear.
00192	Winterfell is yours.
00193	- Where's the devil? - do you go silly
00194	Who is this?
00195	I'm Robb.
00196	Well, a pretty girl.
00197	What's your name?
00198	Arya.
00199	Oh, for the mouse.
00200	He will be a soldier.
00201	It's Jaime Lannister's twin brother.
00202	Can you please?
00203	Dear Queen.
00204	Dear Queen.
00205	Take me to the grave. I want to perform the ceremony.
00206	We have been going for a month, sir.
00207	Make sure the dead person can wait.
00208	Ned.
00209	Where are the dwarfs?
00210	Where is your baby?
00211	Go and find that little devil here.
00212	Tell the goddess about Jon Arryn's story.
00213	He was fine then ...
00214	But then it knocked him down, no matter what.
00215	I really like him.
00216	Neither of us.
00217	He did not have to teach him everything but I did the opposite.
00218	Remember when I was 16?
00219	That's all I want
00220	It's a bunch of guys and girls.
00221	- He showed us the right thing wrong. - Aye.
00222	Do not look at me like that. I do not listen to that is not his fault.
00223	I need you, Ned ...
00224	At King's Landing, not at the place where he was not useful.
00225	Lord Eddard Stark
00226	Now I give you the title of King's Hand.
00227	God is not worthy of that honor.
00228	I did not try to honor you. I just tried to get you to rule the kingdom for me
00229	while I eat and drink whiskey until I die.
00230	Damn it, Ned, get up.
00231	He helped us to occupy the throne
00232	Now help us keep that throne.
00233	We will rule together.
00234	If your sister was alive we were already brothers.
00235	It's not too late yet.
00236	I have a son, you have a daughter.
00237	We will end up joining.
00238	Did you hear anything about the king at Winterfell?
00239	Listen a little.
00240	And the queen with her twin brother.
00241	They said that he is the most handsome man in the 7th.
00242	And the other brother?
00243	- Queen has two brother? - That's the most handsome guy
00244	This is the smartest person.
00245	Mmm, the card reader says they call him a dwarf demon.
00246	I heard he did not like that nickname.
00247	I heard he was more than that nickname.
00248	He heard that he was a worm
00249	and a very lewd man.
00250	Smart girl.
00251	We wait for you, Mr. Tyrion.
00252	Really?
00253	- Are you up?
00254	The gods give us only one of these abilities.
00255	- Wake up. - Dear Sir.
00256	Do you need to explain to me about the closed rooms
00257	- Tai broth not, brother? - No doubt, I really have a lot to teach you
00258	But our sister wants us to be there.
00259	Our sisters have bizarre desires
00260	Family characteristics
00261	Stark will entertain us in the afternoon.
00262	Do not let him alone with those guys.
00263	Sorry, but I got into the party a little early.
00264	And this is just one increase.
00265	I also think you said that.
00266	But we have a little time ...
00267	Look at the girls.
00268	See you in the afternoon.
00269	Close the door!
00270	You have to bury her in a place like this?
00271	She should be buried on a hill
00272	where there is sunshine and clouds.
00273	She is the goddess.
00274	This is where she belongs.
00275	She belongs to me.
00276	In my dreams, I kill him every night.
00277	The wages have already been paid, sir.
00278	Targaryens were destroyed.
00279	Not all.
00280	Daenerys!
00281	Daenerys.
00282	Our future brides here.
00283	A gift from Illyrio.
00284	Touch it.
00285	Do it, feel the fabric.
00286	It's true that a hostess is a guest, is not she?
00287	We have been his guest for a year
00288	And he never asked me anything.
00289	Illyrio is not a fool.
00290	He knew I would never forget his friend
00291	when we regain the throne.
00292	I'm too heavy.
00293	Let them see.
00294	I have a woman's body now.
00295	I need you to be perfect today.
00296	Can you do that for me?
00297	You do not want to wake up the dragon, right?
00298	Are not.
00299	When they recorded the history of my royal court dear dear
00300	They will write that the dynasty began today.
00301	It's too hot, ladies.
00302	Where is he?
00303	The Dothraki were never known as punctual.
00304	Allow me to introduce my honored guests?
00305	Third Viserys of the Targaryen House,
00306	For the legitimate king of Andals and the Founder,
00307	and his royal
00308	Daenerys of Targaryen.
00309	Do you see his hair long?
00310	Every time a Dothraki loses in a match,
00311	They will cut their hair to show the world their humiliation.
00312	Khal Drogo has never lost.
00313	Of course he was a wild man
00314	But he is the best killer.
00315	And you will be his queen.
00316	Come on, ladies.
00317	Where is he going ?!
00318	- The ritual ends. - But he did not say anything.
00319	- Does he like her? - Believe me, sir
00320	If he does not like it then I know.
00321	It will not be long.
00322	He will cross the Black Sea
00323	and regain the throne of his father.
00324	Secret people drank
00325	for your health.
00326	They longed for their true king.
00327	When do they get married?
00328	Soon. Dothraki never waited long.
00329	Are they really sleeping with their horses?
00330	God will not ask Khal Drogo.
00331	Are you an idiot?
00332	God always regarded him as a king.
00333	Tangs often lack the precaution of civilians.
00334	I apologize if I have committed the offense.
00335	I know how to control a guy like Drogo.
00336	I gave him a queen and he gave me an army.
00337	I do not want to be his queen.
00338	I want to go home.
00339	Me too.
00340	I want both of us to come back
00341	But they have stripped us all.
00342	Then tell me to see the royal family
00343	How do we get back here?
00344	I do not know.
00345	We return to the army.
00346	Khal Drogo's troops.
00347	I will let one of his tribe sleep with you ...
00348	40 thousand horses
00349	If it is the price to pay.
00350	Do you think Joffrey will like you?
00351	What does he think is bad?
00352	So he was the stupidest royal ever.
00353	He is so handsome.
00354	When will we be together? Early? Or do we have to wait?
00355	What words are you? Your father has not accepted yet.
00356	Do not you say?
00357	You will become the most powerful person only after the king.
00358	So he will have to leave home.
00359	And leave her.
00360	And you too.
00361	Mom left home to go here.
00362	And one day you will become queen.
00363	Please get your father to accept it!
00364	- Sansa ... - Please!
00365	This is the only thing I want.
00366	Was he dead?
00367	Uncle Benjen.
00368	I'm big.
00369	I have to ride a horse all day. Do not want to leave you with the Lannisters.
00370	Why do not you party?
00371	Lady Stark thought it was offensive to the royal family
00372	If you let a wild child enter the party.
00373	Well, you are always welcome in the Wall.
00374	No one wild child was denied a place there.
00375	So take me with you.
00376	- Jon ... - I will let you go if you ask him.
00377	Make sure that.
00378	The wall will go nowhere.
00379	I'm ready
00380	to perform the oath.
00381	I do not know what to give up.
00382	We have no family.
00383	- None of us are fathered ... - I do not care!
00384	I would care if I lived there.
00385	We should go in
00386	To save your father from the guests.
00387	I say later.
00388	Your uncle in the Team of the Night.
00389	What are you doing here?
00390	Prepare to party with your family.
00391	I always wanted to see that wall.
00392	He is Tyrion Lannister
00393	Empress's brother?
00394	The greatest achievement in our life.
00395	And you are the bastard of Ned Stark, right?
00396	I offend you? Sorry.
00397	You are still a bastard.
00398	Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
00399	And Lady Stark is not your mother
00400	meaning you are a bastard.
00401	I advise you some of this, bastard.
00402	Never forget who you are.
00403	The whole world will not forget.
00404	Wear it as a piece of armor
00405	And you can not use that to hurt you anymore.
00406	What the hell are you know about being a wild child?
00407	All dwarves are bastards in their father's eyes.
00408	Every time he goes to the party is like a bear trap.
00409	Kidneys beheaded
00410	- You know it? - Of course I know.
00411	Just a kid.
00412	And it's very brave, Ned
00413	a true soldier
00414	It's crazy talk.
00415	It says the White Ball has killed its friend.
00416	The two of them with him still missing.
00417	An ambush of the wanderers.
00418	Maybe.
00419	Snowflakes in the south of the Wall
00420	The stories of the White Ball
00421	and my brother is going to become the King's Hand.
00422	Winter is coming.
00423	Movement is coming.
00424	- Uncle Benjen. - Robb.
00425	- How are you? - I'm fine.
00426	This is the first time you have come to the North?
00427	Yes, a very lovely place.
00428	It's pretty bleak compared to King's Landing.
00429	Spirit still remember the first time Ned ...
00430	take the gods here.
00431	Hello girl.
00432	But really a beautiful girl.
00433	- How old are you? - 13, Queen.
00434	Are you tall, still growing?
00435	I think so, Empress.
00436	Have you lost virginity
00437	No, queen.
00438	Do you dress yourself?
00439	Very skillful, you have to make me something.
00440	I heard that we will have a baby.
00441	God sounds like that.
00442	Your girlfriend is very suitable to live in the capital.
00443	American people should not be living here until the end of life here.
00444	- Get him permission. - I heard that we are going to be neighbors.
00445	- I hope that is true. - Yes
00446	The king made an offer to me.
00447	I'm sure we will have a match
00448	to congratulate your new title ... if you agree.
00449	It was good if you were at the stadium.
00450	These competitions are a bit boring.
00451	- I did not participate in that match. - No?
00452	All right?
00453	I did not participate in the competition
00454	Because when I fight, I fight
00455	I do not want to let my opponent know what I can do.
00456	Said that great.
00457	- Arya!
00458	Not fun!
00459	It always does.
00460	This is my best shirt.
00461	He always does this!
00462	It's time to sleep.
00463	I am the North.
00464	I belong here with you, not the South
00465	In the rat hole that we call the Capitol
00466	I do not let him take him anywhere.
00467	The king took what he wanted.
00468	That is why he is king.
00469	I will say, "Hey, fat man"
00470	You can not take my husband.
00471	He belongs to me. "
00472	Why is he fat?
00473	He just stopped eating when he was drinking.
00474	It's Maester Luwin, sir.
00475	Put him in.
00476	Please forgive 2 people.
00477	A horseman arrives in the middle of the night ...
00478	From the lady's sister.
00479	- Just stay. - This is a letter from Eyrie.
00480	What does she do at Eyrie?
00481	She has not come back since the wedding.
00482	What is it?
00483	She ran away from the capital.
00484	She said Jon Arryn was murdered.
00485	By the Lannisters.
00486	She said the king was in danger.
00487	She lost her husband, Cat.
00488	She does not know what she is saying.
00489	Lysa's head was already on the pole
00490	If another person finds the letter.
00491	He thought she risked her life ...
00492	her son ...
00493	If she is not sure her husband was murdered?
00494	If this is true
00495	and the Lannisters are plotting a throne
00496	Who else except you can protect the king?
00497	They tried to kill the last adviser.
00498	Now you want Ned to accept that position?
00499	The king had been riding horses for a month
00500	just to ask for the help of Mr. Stark.
00501	He is the only one who trusts.
00502	He swore an oath to the king.
00503	He spent half his life fighting Roberts.
00504	He does not owe anybody anything.
00505	His father and brother went south
00506	at the request of the king.
00507	In another time.
00508	For another king.
00509	When did we first meet Khal?
00510	We need to start the plan of aggression.
00511	If Khal Drogo promised him the throne
00512	- you will get it. - But when?
00513	When their omens allow them to wage war.
00514	I despise the signs.
00515	I have waited 17 years to get the throne.
00516	A wedding of the Dothraki
00517	If there are no at least 3 dead, it is considered invalid.
00518	A gift from the new khaleesi ...
00519	Songs and History of 7 Kinh Do.
00520	Thank you.
00521	Are you a man of my country?
00522	Knight Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.
00523	I have been serving my father for many years.
00524	I always hope to serve 1 for the true king.
00525	Dragon Eggs, Daenerys
00526	From my shadow to Asshai.
00527	Five months have made them petrified
00528	But they are still beautiful.
00529	Thank you, sir.
00530	So beautiful.
00531	Ser Jorah, I do not know how to say thank you
00532	in the Dothraki language.
00533	Dothraki language does not have a word of thanks.
00534	Make him happy.
00535	- Are not
00536	Do you understand the basic words?
00537	Are not.
00538	Is not that the only word you know?
00539	Are not.
00540	A hard night, dwarf?
00541	If we pass a night without
00542	Make a girl happy or happy, it is a miracle.
00543	I did not pick people when I was hunting.
00544	Our teacher hit it.
00545	No more hunting if you pay for them.
00546	Are you still as good as you used to be?
00547	No, but better than you.
00548	I know what I'm doing to you.
00549	Thank you for accepting.
00550	I only ask you when I need you.
00551	He is a loyal friend.
00552	Did you say that? A loyal friend.
00553	And my last one.
00554	- Hope I will serve you well. - Sure.
00555	And I'm sure you will not be bored all day.
00556	Come on, kill the wild boar!
00557	Come on, kid.
00558	Stop!
00559	Stop
00560	Are you crazy?
00561	- It sees us. - okay, that's okay
00562	It has seen us!
00563	You hear it.
00564	Leo climbing well?
00565	- How old are you? - ten.
00566	What we do for love is here.

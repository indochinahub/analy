English-HarryPotter02-1  Lumos Maxima. 
English-HarryPotter02-2  Lumos Maxima. 
English-HarryPotter02-3  Lumos Maxima. 
English-HarryPotter02-4  Lumos Maxima. 
English-HarryPotter02-5  Lumos Maxima! 
English-HarryPotter02-6  Harry. Harry. 
English-HarryPotter02-7  Harry, open the door. 
English-HarryPotter02-8  Marge. How lovely to see... 
English-HarryPotter02-9  Uncle Vernon I need you to sign this form. 
English-HarryPotter02-10  What is it? 
English-HarryPotter02-11  Nothing. School stuff. 
English-HarryPotter02-12  Later perhaps, if you behave. 
English-HarryPotter02-13  I will if she does. 
English-HarryPotter02-14  - Oh, you're still here, are you? - Yes. 
English-HarryPotter02-15  Don't say yes in that ungrateful way. 
English-HarryPotter02-16  Damn good of my brother to keep you. 
English-HarryPotter02-17  He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep. 
English-HarryPotter02-18  Is that my Dudders? Is that my little neffy-pooh? 
English-HarryPotter02-19  Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up. 
English-HarryPotter02-20  Take Marge's suitcase upstairs. 
English-HarryPotter02-21  Okay. 
English-HarryPotter02-22  Finish that off for Mommy. Good boy, Rippy-pooh. 
English-HarryPotter02-23  - Can I tempt you, Marge? - Just a small one. 
English-HarryPotter02-24  Excellent nosh, Petunia. 
English-HarryPotter02-25  A bit more. 
English-HarryPotter02-26  Usually just a fry-up for me what with 12 dogs. 
English-HarryPotter02-27  Just a bit more. That's a boy. 
English-HarryPotter02-28  You wanna try a little drop of brandy? 
English-HarryPotter02-29  A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh? 
English-HarryPotter02-30  What are you smirking at? 
English-HarryPotter02-31  Where did you send the boy Vernon? 
English-HarryPotter02-32  St. Brutus'. It's a fine institution for hopeless cases. 
English-HarryPotter02-33  Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy? 
English-HarryPotter02-34  Oh, yeah. 
English-HarryPotter02-35  Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times. 
English-HarryPotter02-36  Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby... 
English-HarryPotter02-37  ...wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it. 
English-HarryPotter02-38  You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out. 
English-HarryPotter02-39  It's all to do with blood. Bad blood will out. 
English-HarryPotter02-40  What is it the boy's father did Petunia? 
English-HarryPotter02-41  Nothing. He didn't work. He was unemployed. 
English-HarryPotter02-42  - And a drunk too, no doubt? - That's a lie. 
English-HarryPotter02-43  - What did you say? - My dad wasn't a drunk. 
English-HarryPotter02-44  Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia. I have a very firm grip. 
English-HarryPotter02-45  I think it's time you went to bed. 
English-HarryPotter02-46  Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up. 
English-HarryPotter02-47  Actually, it's nothing to do with the father. 
English-HarryPotter02-48  It's all to do with the mother. You see it all the time with dogs. 
English-HarryPotter02-49  If something's wrong with the bitch then something's wrong with the pup. 
English-HarryPotter02-50  Shut up! Shut up! 
English-HarryPotter02-51  Right. 
English-HarryPotter02-52  Let me tell you... 
English-HarryPotter02-53  Vernon! 
English-HarryPotter02-54  Vernon! Vernon, do something! 
English-HarryPotter02-55  Stop! 
English-HarryPotter02-56  I've got you, Marge. I've got you. 
English-HarryPotter02-57  - Hold on, hold on. - Get off. 
English-HarryPotter02-58  - Don't you dare! - Sorry. 
English-HarryPotter02-59  Oh, Vernon. 
English-HarryPotter02-60  Oh, God. 
English-HarryPotter02-61  Marge! 
English-HarryPotter02-62  Please! 
English-HarryPotter02-63  Marge! 
English-HarryPotter02-64  Come back! 
English-HarryPotter02-65  You bring her back! You bring her back now. 
English-HarryPotter02-66  - You put her right! - No. She deserved what she got. 
English-HarryPotter02-67  - Keep away from me. - You can't do magic outside school. 
English-HarryPotter02-68  - Yeah? Try me. - They won't let you back now. 
English-HarryPotter02-69  You've nowhere to go. 
English-HarryPotter02-70  I don't care. Anywhere is better than here. 
English-HarryPotter02-71  "Welcome to the Knight Bus... 
English-HarryPotter02-72  ...emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. 
English-HarryPotter02-73  My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening." 
English-HarryPotter02-74  What you doing down there? 
English-HarryPotter02-75  - I fell over. - What you fall over for? 
English-HarryPotter02-76  - I didn't do it on purpose. - Well, come on, then. 
English-HarryPotter02-77  Let's not wait for the grass to grow. 
English-HarryPotter02-78  - What you looking at? - Nothing. 
English-HarryPotter02-79  Well, come on, then. In. 
English-HarryPotter02-80  No, no, no. I'll get this. You get in. 
English-HarryPotter02-81  Come on. 
English-HarryPotter02-82  Come on. Move on, move on. 
English-HarryPotter02-83  - Take her away, Ern. - Yeah, take it away, Ernie. 
English-HarryPotter02-84  It's going to be a bumpy ride. 
English-HarryPotter02-85  - What did you say your name was? - I didn't. 
English-HarryPotter02-86  - Whereabouts are you headed? - The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London. 
English-HarryPotter02-87  You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London." 
English-HarryPotter02-88  The Leaky Cauldron. If you have pea soup... 
English-HarryPotter02-89  ...make sure you eat it before it eats you. 
English-HarryPotter02-90  - But the Muggles. Can't they see us? - Muggles? 
English-HarryPotter02-91  They don't see nothing, do they? 
English-HarryPotter02-92  No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel. 
English-HarryPotter02-93  Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock! 
English-HarryPotter02-94  Ten, nine, eight... 
English-HarryPotter02-95  ...seven, six, five... 
English-HarryPotter02-96  ...four, three, three and a half... 
English-HarryPotter02-97  ...two, one and three quarters. 
English-HarryPotter02-98  Yes! 
English-HarryPotter02-99  Who is that? 
English-HarryPotter02-100  That man. 
English-HarryPotter02-101  Who is that? 
English-HarryPotter02-102  Who is...? 
English-HarryPotter02-103  That is Sirius Black, that is. 
English-HarryPotter02-104  Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black. 
English-HarryPotter02-105  He's a murderer. 
English-HarryPotter02-106  Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it. 
English-HarryPotter02-107  - How did he escape? - Well, that's the question, isn't it? 
English-HarryPotter02-108  He's the first one that done it. 
English-HarryPotter02-109  He was a big supporter of... 
English-HarryPotter02-110  ...You-Know-Who. 
English-HarryPotter02-111  I reckon you've heard of him. 
English-HarryPotter02-112  Yeah. 
English-HarryPotter02-113  Him I've heard of. 
English-HarryPotter02-114  Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock. 
English-HarryPotter02-115  They're getting closer, Ernie. 
English-HarryPotter02-116  Ernie, they're right on top of us! 
English-HarryPotter02-117  Mind your head. 
English-HarryPotter02-118  Hey, guys? Guys? 
English-HarryPotter02-119  Why the long faces? 
English-HarryPotter02-120  Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there. 
English-HarryPotter02-121  - The Leaky Cauldron. - Next stop, Knockturn Alley. 
English-HarryPotter02-122  Mr. Potter, at last. 
English-HarryPotter02-123  - Take it away, Ern. - Yeah, take it away, Ernie! 
English-HarryPotter02-124  Room 11. 
English-HarryPotter02-125  Hedwig. 
English-HarryPotter02-126  Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter. 
English-HarryPotter02-127  He arrived here just five minutes before yourself. 
English-HarryPotter02-128  As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter... 
English-HarryPotter02-129  ...earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located... 
English-HarryPotter02-130  ...a little south of Sheffield circling a chimney stack. 
English-HarryPotter02-131  The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately. 
English-HarryPotter02-132  She has been properly punctured and her memory modified. 
English-HarryPotter02-133  She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever. 
English-HarryPotter02-134  So that's that... 
English-HarryPotter02-135  ...and no harm done. 
English-HarryPotter02-136  Pea soup? 
English-HarryPotter02-137  No, thank you. 
English-HarryPotter02-138  - Minister? - Yes? 
English-HarryPotter02-139  - I don't understand. - Understand? 
English-HarryPotter02-140  I broke the law. Underage wizards can't use magic at home. 
English-HarryPotter02-141  Come now. The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban... 
English-HarryPotter02-142  ...for blowing up their aunts. 
English-HarryPotter02-143  On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things... 
English-HarryPotter02-144  ...was very, very irresponsible. 
English-HarryPotter02-145  - "The state of things," sir? - We have a killer on the loose. 
English-HarryPotter02-146  Sirius Black, you mean? 
English-HarryPotter02-147  But what's he got to do with me? 
English-HarryPotter02-148  Nothing, of course. You're safe. And that's what matters. 
English-HarryPotter02-149  And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts. 
English-HarryPotter02-150  These are your new schoolbooks. I took the liberty... 
English-HarryPotter02-151  ...of having them brought here. Now Tom will show you to your room. 
English-HarryPotter02-152  Hedwig. 
English-HarryPotter02-153  Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't... 
English-HarryPotter02-154  ...wander. 
English-HarryPotter02-155  Right! You gonna move that bus or what? 
English-HarryPotter02-156  Housekeeping. 
English-HarryPotter02-157  I'll come back later. 
English-HarryPotter02-158  I'm warning you, Hermione. 
English-HarryPotter02-159  Keep that beast away from Scabbers or I'll turn it into a tea cozy. 
English-HarryPotter02-160  It's a cat, Ronald. What do you expect? 
English-HarryPotter02-161  - It's in his nature. - A cat? Is that what they told you? 
English-HarryPotter02-162  - Looks like a pig with hair. - That's rich... 
English-HarryPotter02-163  ...coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush. 
English-HarryPotter02-164  Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy. 
English-HarryPotter02-165  Harry. 
English-HarryPotter02-166  Harry. 
English-HarryPotter02-167  - Egypt. What's it like? - Brilliant. Loads of old stuff... 
English-HarryPotter02-168  ...like mummies, tombs even Scabbers enjoyed himself. 
English-HarryPotter02-169  - Egyptians used to worship cats. - Along with the dung beetle. 
English-HarryPotter02-170  - Not flashing that clipping again? - I haven't shown anyone. 
English-HarryPotter02-171  No, not a soul. Not unless you count Tom. 
English-HarryPotter02-172  - The day maid. - Night maid. 
English-HarryPotter02-173  - Cook. - The bloke who fixed the toilet. 
English-HarryPotter02-174  - Harry. - Mrs. Weasley. 
English-HarryPotter02-175  - Good to see you, dear. - Good to see you. 
English-HarryPotter02-176  - Got everything? - Yes. 
English-HarryPotter02-177  - Yes? All your books? - It's all upstairs. 
English-HarryPotter02-178  - Your clothes? - Everything. 
English-HarryPotter02-179  - Good boy. - Thank you. 
English-HarryPotter02-180  - Harry Potter. - Mr. Weasley. 
English-HarryPotter02-181  - Harry, wonder if I might have a word? - Yeah, sure. 
English-HarryPotter02-182  - Hermione. - Good morning, Mr. Weasley. 
English-HarryPotter02-183  - Looking forward to a new term? - Yeah. It should be great. 
English-HarryPotter02-184  Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me... 
English-HarryPotter02-185  ...from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you. 
English-HarryPotter02-186  But I think that you need to know the facts. 
English-HarryPotter02-187  You are in danger. 
English-HarryPotter02-188  Grave danger. 
English-HarryPotter02-189  Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir? 
English-HarryPotter02-190  What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry? 
English-HarryPotter02-191  - Only that he's escaped from Azkaban. - Do you know why? 
English-HarryPotter02-192  Thirteen years ago when you stopped... 
English-HarryPotter02-193  - Voldemort. - Don't say his name. 
English-HarryPotter02-194  Sorry. 
English-HarryPotter02-195  When you stopped You-Know-Who... 
English-HarryPotter02-196  ...Black lost everything. 
English-HarryPotter02-197  But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant. 
English-HarryPotter02-198  And in his mind... 
English-HarryPotter02-199  ...you are the only thing that stands in the way... 
English-HarryPotter02-200  ...of You-Know-Who returning to power. 
English-HarryPotter02-201  And that is why... 
English-HarryPotter02-202  ...he has escaped from Azkaban. 
English-HarryPotter02-203  To find you. 
English-HarryPotter02-204  And kill me. 
English-HarryPotter02-205  Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear... 
English-HarryPotter02-206  ...you won't go looking for Black. 
English-HarryPotter02-207  Mr. Weasley... 
English-HarryPotter02-208  ...why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me? 
English-HarryPotter02-209  Quick. Quick. 
English-HarryPotter02-210  Ron, Ron! 
English-HarryPotter02-211  Oh, for goodness' sake! 
English-HarryPotter02-212  Don't lose him! 
English-HarryPotter02-213  I didn't mean to blow her up. I just... 
English-HarryPotter02-214  - I lost control. - Brilliant. 
English-HarryPotter02-215  Honestly, Ron, it's not funny. Harry was lucky not to be expelled. 
English-HarryPotter02-216  I was lucky not to be arrested. 
English-HarryPotter02-217  I still think it was brilliant. 
English-HarryPotter02-218  Come on. Everywhere else is full. 
English-HarryPotter02-219  Who do you think that is? 
English-HarryPotter02-220  - Professor R.J. Lupin. - Do you know everything? 
English-HarryPotter02-221  How is it she knows everything? 
English-HarryPotter02-222  - It's on his suitcase, Ronald. - Oh. 
English-HarryPotter02-223  - Do you think he's really asleep? - Seems to be. Why? 
English-HarryPotter02-224  I gotta tell you something. 
English-HarryPotter02-225  Let me get this straight. Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban... 
English-HarryPotter02-226  ...to come after you? - Yeah. 
English-HarryPotter02-227  But they'll catch Black, won't they? 
English-HarryPotter02-228  - I mean, everyone's looking for him. - Sure. 
English-HarryPotter02-229  Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before... 
English-HarryPotter02-230  ...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic. - Thanks, Ron. 
English-HarryPotter02-231  Why are we stopping? 
English-HarryPotter02-232  We can't be there yet. 
English-HarryPotter02-233  What's going on? 
English-HarryPotter02-234  I don't know. Maybe we've broken down. 
English-HarryPotter02-235  Ouch, Ron. That was my foot. 
English-HarryPotter02-236  There's something moving out there. 
English-HarryPotter02-237  I think someone's coming aboard. 
English-HarryPotter02-238  Bloody hell! What's happening? 
English-HarryPotter02-239  Harry. 
English-HarryPotter02-240  Harry, are you all right? 
English-HarryPotter02-241  Thank you. 
English-HarryPotter02-242  Here, eat this. It'll help. 
English-HarryPotter02-243  It's all right. It's chocolate. 
English-HarryPotter02-244  What was that thing that came? 
English-HarryPotter02-245  It was a dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now. 
English-HarryPotter02-246  It was searching the train for Sirius Black. 
English-HarryPotter02-247  If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver. 
English-HarryPotter02-248  Eat. You'll feel better. 
English-HarryPotter02-249  What happened to me? 
English-HarryPotter02-250  Well, you sort of went rigid. 
English-HarryPotter02-251  We thought maybe you were having a fit or something. 
English-HarryPotter02-252  And did either of you two... 
English-HarryPotter02-253  ...you know... 
English-HarryPotter02-254  ...pass out? - No. 
English-HarryPotter02-255  I felt weird, though. 
English-HarryPotter02-256  Like I'd never be cheerful again. 
English-HarryPotter02-257  But someone was screaming. 
English-HarryPotter02-258  A woman. 
English-HarryPotter02-259  No one was screaming, Harry. 
English-HarryPotter02-260  Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts. 
English-HarryPotter02-261  Now, I'd like to say a few words... 
English-HarryPotter02-262  ...before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast. 
English-HarryPotter02-263  First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin... 
English-HarryPotter02-264  ...who's kindly consented to fill the post... 
English-HarryPotter02-265  ...of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. 
English-HarryPotter02-266  Good luck, professor. 
English-HarryPotter02-267  Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry. 
English-HarryPotter02-268  Potter. Is it true you fainted? 
English-HarryPotter02-269  - I mean, you actually fainted? - Shove off, Malfoy. 
English-HarryPotter02-270  - How did he find out? - Just forget it. 
English-HarryPotter02-271  Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher... 
English-HarryPotter02-272  ...has decided to retire... 
English-HarryPotter02-273  ...in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs. 
English-HarryPotter02-274  Fortunately I'm delighted to announce... 
English-HarryPotter02-275  ...that his place will be taken by none other... 
English-HarryPotter02-276  ...than our own Rubeus Hagrid. 
English-HarryPotter02-277  Finally, on a more disquieting note... 
English-HarryPotter02-278  ...at the request of the Ministry of Magic... 
English-HarryPotter02-279  ...Hogwarts will, until further notice play host to the dementors of Azkaban... 
English-HarryPotter02-280  ...until such a time as Sirius Black is captured. 
English-HarryPotter02-281  The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds. 
English-HarryPotter02-282  Now whilst I've been assured... 
English-HarryPotter02-283  ...that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities... 
English-HarryPotter02-284  ...a word of caution. 
English-HarryPotter02-285  Dementors are vicious creatures. They'll not distinguish... 
English-HarryPotter02-286  ...between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way. 
English-HarryPotter02-287  Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you... 
English-HarryPotter02-288  ...to give them no reason to harm you. 
English-HarryPotter02-289  It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving. 
English-HarryPotter02-290  But you know happiness can be found... 
English-HarryPotter02-291  ...even in the darkest of times... 
English-HarryPotter02-292  ...if one only remembers to turn on the light. 
English-HarryPotter02-293  Fortuna Major. 
English-HarryPotter02-294  Here, listen. She just won't let me in. 
English-HarryPotter02-295  - Fortuna Major. - No, no. Wait, wait. 
English-HarryPotter02-296  Watch this. 
English-HarryPotter02-297  - Amazing. Just with my voice. - Fortuna Major. 
English-HarryPotter02-298  - Yes, all right. Go in. - Thank you. 
English-HarryPotter02-299  Still doing that after three years. 
English-HarryPotter02-300  - She can't even sing. - Exactly. 
English-HarryPotter02-301  - Hey, man. - Hey, man. 
English-HarryPotter02-302  - Oh, God. - That's awful. 
English-HarryPotter02-303  Green. That's a monkey. 
English-HarryPotter02-304  - What is that? - You call that a monkey? 
English-HarryPotter02-305  Do not give him one again. 
English-HarryPotter02-306  Hey, Neville, try an elephant. 
English-HarryPotter02-307  - Ron, catch. - I will. 
English-HarryPotter02-308  I think we have a winner. 
English-HarryPotter02-309  - Oh, don't try one of them. - Oh, no. 
English-HarryPotter02-310  Look at him. His face. 
English-HarryPotter02-311  Welcome, my children. 
English-HarryPotter02-312  In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination. 
English-HarryPotter02-313  In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight. 
English-HarryPotter02-314  Hello. I am Professor Trelawney. 
English-HarryPotter02-315  Together we shall cast ourselves into the future. 
English-HarryPotter02-316  This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy the art of reading tea leaves. 
English-HarryPotter02-317  So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you. 
English-HarryPotter02-318  What do you see? 
English-HarryPotter02-319  The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read. 
English-HarryPotter02-320  But first, you must broaden your minds. 
English-HarryPotter02-321  - First, you must look beyond. - What a load of rubbish. 
English-HarryPotter02-322  - Where did you come from? - Me? 
English-HarryPotter02-323  - I've been here all this time. - You, boy... 
English-HarryPotter02-324  Is your grandmother quite well? 
English-HarryPotter02-325  I think so. 
English-HarryPotter02-326  I wouldn't be so sure of that. Give me the cup. 
English-HarryPotter02-327  Pity. 
English-HarryPotter02-328  Broaden your minds. 
English-HarryPotter02-329  Your aura is pulsing, dear. Are you in the beyond? 
English-HarryPotter02-330  - I think you are. - Sure. 
English-HarryPotter02-331  Look at the cup. Tell me what you see. 
English-HarryPotter02-332  Yeah. 
English-HarryPotter02-333  Harry's got sort of a wonky cross. That's trials and suffering. 
English-HarryPotter02-334  And that there could be the sun and that's happiness. 
English-HarryPotter02-335  So... 
English-HarryPotter02-336  ...you're gonna suffer but you're gonna be happy about it. 
English-HarryPotter02-337  Give me the cup. 
English-HarryPotter02-338  Oh, my dear boy. 
English-HarryPotter02-339  My dear... 
English-HarryPotter02-340  ...you have the Grim. 
English-HarryPotter02-341  The Grin? What's the Grin? 
English-HarryPotter02-342  Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim. 
English-HarryPotter02-343  "Taking form of a giant spectral dog. 
English-HarryPotter02-344  It's among the darkest omens in our world. 
English-HarryPotter02-345  It's an omen... 
English-HarryPotter02-346  ...of death." 
English-HarryPotter02-347  You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black? 
English-HarryPotter02-348  Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me Divination's a woolly discipline. 
English-HarryPotter02-349  Now, Ancient Runes that's a fascinating subject. 
English-HarryPotter02-350  Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking? 
English-HarryPotter02-351  A fair few. 
English-HarryPotter02-352  Hang on. That's not possible. 
English-HarryPotter02-353  Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination. 
English-HarryPotter02-354  You have to be in two classes at once. 
English-HarryPotter02-355  Don't be silly. How could anyone be in two classes at once? 
English-HarryPotter02-356  "Broaden your minds. Use your Inner Eye to see the future." 
English-HarryPotter02-357  That's it. Come on, now. Come closer. Less talking, if you don't mind. 
English-HarryPotter02-358  I got a real treat for you today. 
English-HarryPotter02-359  A great lesson. So follow me. 
English-HarryPotter02-360  Right, you lot. Less chattering. Form a group over there. 
English-HarryPotter02-361  And open your books to page 49. 
English-HarryPotter02-362  Exactly how do we do that? 
English-HarryPotter02-363  Just stroke the spine, of course. Goodness me. 
English-HarryPotter02-364  - Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom. - I'm okay. Okay. 
English-HarryPotter02-365  - I think they're funny. - Oh, yeah. Terribly funny. 
English-HarryPotter02-366  Witty. God, this place has gone to the dogs. 
English-HarryPotter02-367  Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes. 
English-HarryPotter02-368  Shut up, Malfoy. 
English-HarryPotter02-369  Dementor! Dementor! 
English-HarryPotter02-370  - Just ignore him. - You're supposed to stroke it. 
English-HarryPotter02-371  Yeah. 
English-HarryPotter02-372  Isn't he beautiful? 
English-HarryPotter02-373  Say hello to Buckbeak. 
English-HarryPotter02-374  Hagrid, exactly what is that? 
English-HarryPotter02-375  That, Ron, is a hippogriff. 
English-HarryPotter02-376  First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures. 
English-HarryPotter02-377  Very easily offended. You do not want to insult a hippogriff. 
English-HarryPotter02-378  It may be the last thing you ever do. 
English-HarryPotter02-379  Now, who'd like to come and say hello? 
English-HarryPotter02-380  Well done, Harry. Well done. 
English-HarryPotter02-381  Come on now. 
English-HarryPotter02-382  Now... 
English-HarryPotter02-383  ...you have to let him make the first move. It's only polite. So... 
English-HarryPotter02-384  ...step up. Give him a nice bow. 
English-HarryPotter02-385  Then you wait and see if he bows back. 
English-HarryPotter02-386  If he does, you can go and touch him. 
English-HarryPotter02-387  If not... Well we'll get to that later. 
English-HarryPotter02-388  Just make your bow. 
English-HarryPotter02-389  Nice and low. 
English-HarryPotter02-390  Back off, Harry. Back off. 
English-HarryPotter02-391  Keep still. 
English-HarryPotter02-392  Keep still. 
English-HarryPotter02-393  Well done, Harry. Well done. Here, you big brute, you. 
English-HarryPotter02-394  Right. I think you can go and pat him now. 
English-HarryPotter02-395  Go on. Don't be shy. 
English-HarryPotter02-396  Nice and slow, now. Nice and slow. Slow. 
English-HarryPotter02-397  Not so fast, Harry. 
English-HarryPotter02-398  Slow down, Harry. That's it... 
English-HarryPotter02-399  Nice and slow. Now let him come to you. 
English-HarryPotter02-400  Slowly, now, slowly, slowly... 
English-HarryPotter02-401  That's it... 
English-HarryPotter02-402  Yes! 
English-HarryPotter02-403  Well done! Well done, Harry well done! 
English-HarryPotter02-404  Does he get to fly? 
English-HarryPotter02-405  - I think he may let you ride him now. - What? 
English-HarryPotter02-406  - Come on. - Hey, hey, hey! 
English-HarryPotter02-407  Put you over here just behind the wing joint. 
English-HarryPotter02-408  Don't pull out any of his feathers because he won't thank you for that. 
English-HarryPotter02-409  Well done, Harry, and well done Buckbeak. 
English-HarryPotter02-410  That was wicked, Harry! 
English-HarryPotter02-411  Oh, please. 
English-HarryPotter02-412  Well done, well done. 
English-HarryPotter02-413  - How am I doing me first day? - Brilliant, professor. 
English-HarryPotter02-414  You're not dangerous at all, are you you great ugly brute! 
English-HarryPotter02-415  Malfoy, no... 
English-HarryPotter02-416  No! 
English-HarryPotter02-417  Buckbeak! 
English-HarryPotter02-418  Whoa, whoa, whoa... 
English-HarryPotter02-419  Whoa! Buckbeak! 
English-HarryPotter02-420  Away, you silly creature... 
English-HarryPotter02-421  - It's killed me! - Calm down. It's just a scratch! 
English-HarryPotter02-422  Hagrid! 
English-HarryPotter02-423  - He has to be taken to the hospital. - I'm the teacher. I'll do it. 
English-HarryPotter02-424  - You're gonna regret this. - Class dismissed! 
English-HarryPotter02-425  You and your bloody chicken! 
English-HarryPotter02-426  Does it hurt terribly, Draco? 
English-HarryPotter02-427  It comes and it goes. Still, I consider myself lucky. 
English-HarryPotter02-428  Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm. 
English-HarryPotter02-429  - I can't do homework for weeks. - Listen to the idiot. 
English-HarryPotter02-430  - He's really laying it on thick, isn't he? - At least Hagrid didn't get fired. 
English-HarryPotter02-431  I hear Draco's father's furious. We haven't heard the end of this. 
English-HarryPotter02-432  - He's been sighted! - Who? 
English-HarryPotter02-433  Sirius Black! 
English-HarryPotter02-434  Dufftown? That's not far from here. 
English-HarryPotter02-435  You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you? 
English-HarryPotter02-436  - With dementors at every entrance? - Dementors? 
English-HarryPotter02-437  He slipped past them once. Who's to say he won't do it again? 
English-HarryPotter02-438  That's right. Black could be anywhere. It's like trying to catch smoke. 
English-HarryPotter02-439  Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands. 
English-HarryPotter02-440  Intriguing, isn't it? 
English-HarryPotter02-441  Would anyone like to venture a guess... 
English-HarryPotter02-442  ...as to what is inside? 
English-HarryPotter02-443  - That's a boggart, that is. - Very good, Mr. Thomas. 
English-HarryPotter02-444  Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like? 
English-HarryPotter02-445  - No one knows. - When did she get here? 
English-HarryPotter02-446  Boggarts are shape-shifters. 
English-HarryPotter02-447  They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most. 
English-HarryPotter02-448  - That's what makes them so... - So terrifying, yes, yes, yes... 
English-HarryPotter02-449  Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart. 
English-HarryPotter02-450  Let's practice it now. Without wands, please. 
English-HarryPotter02-451  After me. Riddikulus! 
English-HarryPotter02-452  - Riddikulus! - Very good. 
English-HarryPotter02-453  A little louder and very clear. Listen: 
English-HarryPotter02-454  - Riddikulus! - Riddikulus! 
English-HarryPotter02-455  - This class is ridiculous. - Very good. 
English-HarryPotter02-456  So much for the easy part. You see the incantation alone is not enough. 
English-HarryPotter02-457  What really finishes a boggart is laughter. 
English-HarryPotter02-458  You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing. 
English-HarryPotter02-459  Let me explain. Neville would you join me, please? 
English-HarryPotter02-460  Come on, don't be shy. Come on. 
English-HarryPotter02-461  Come on. 
English-HarryPotter02-462  Hello. Neville, what frightens you most of all? 
English-HarryPotter02-463  Professor Snape. 
English-HarryPotter02-464  - Sorry? - Professor Snape. 
English-HarryPotter02-465  Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all. 
English-HarryPotter02-466  - You live with your grandmother. - I don't want it to turn into her, either. 
English-HarryPotter02-467  No... 
English-HarryPotter02-468  ...it won't. I want you to picture her clothes. 
English-HarryPotter02-469  Only her clothes, very clearly in your mind. 
English-HarryPotter02-470  - She carries a red handbag... - We don't need to hear. 
English-HarryPotter02-471  As long as you see it, we'll see it. Now, when I open that wardrobe... 
English-HarryPotter02-472  ...here's what I want you to do. Excuse me. 
English-HarryPotter02-473  Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes. 
English-HarryPotter02-474  Can you do that? 
English-HarryPotter02-475  Yes. Wand at the ready. 
English-HarryPotter02-476  One, two, three. 
English-HarryPotter02-477  Think, Neville, think. 
English-HarryPotter02-478  Riddikulus! 
English-HarryPotter02-479  Wonderful, Neville, wonderful! Incredible! Okay... 
English-HarryPotter02-480  ...to the back, Neville. Everyone, form a line... 
English-HarryPotter02-481  Form a line! 
English-HarryPotter02-482  I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most... 
English-HarryPotter02-483  ...and turn it into something funny. 
English-HarryPotter02-484  Next! Ron! 
English-HarryPotter02-485  Concentrate. Face your fear. Be brave! 
English-HarryPotter02-486  Wand at the ready, Ron. 
English-HarryPotter02-487  Riddikulus! 
English-HarryPotter02-488  Yes! 
English-HarryPotter02-489  You see? Very good, very good! 
English-HarryPotter02-490  Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very enjoyable! Parvati! Next! 
English-HarryPotter02-491  Show us what you see. 
English-HarryPotter02-492  Keep your nerve. Steady. 
English-HarryPotter02-493  Riddikulus! 
English-HarryPotter02-494  And next! Step up, step up! 
English-HarryPotter02-495  Wonderful, wonderful! 
English-HarryPotter02-496  Here! 
English-HarryPotter02-497  Riddikulus! 
English-HarryPotter02-498  Right. Sorry about that. That's enough for today. 
English-HarryPotter02-499  Collect your books from the back. 
English-HarryPotter02-500  That's the end of the lesson. Thank you! Sorry! 
English-HarryPotter02-501  Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing. 
English-HarryPotter02-502  Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege. 
English-HarryPotter02-503  Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school... 
English-HarryPotter02-504  ...that privilege shall not be extended again. 
English-HarryPotter02-505  No permission form signed no visiting the village. 
English-HarryPotter02-506  That's the rule, Potter. 
English-HarryPotter02-507  Those with permission, follow me. Those without, stay put. 
English-HarryPotter02-508  I thought if you signed it then I could... 
English-HarryPotter02-509  I can't. Only a parent or a guardian can sign. 
English-HarryPotter02-510  Since I am neither it would be inappropriate. 
English-HarryPotter02-511  I'm sorry, Potter. That's my final word. 
English-HarryPotter02-512  Forget about it, guys. See you later. 
English-HarryPotter02-513  Professor, can I ask you something? 
English-HarryPotter02-514  You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes? 
English-HarryPotter02-515  I thought it'd be obvious. 
English-HarryPotter02-516  I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort. 
English-HarryPotter02-517  I did think of Voldemort at first. 
English-HarryPotter02-518  But then I remembered that night on the train... 
English-HarryPotter02-519  ...and the dementor. - I'm very impressed. 
English-HarryPotter02-520  That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself. 
English-HarryPotter02-521  This is very wise. 
English-HarryPotter02-522  Before I fainted... 
English-HarryPotter02-523  ...I heard something. 
English-HarryPotter02-524  A woman... 
English-HarryPotter02-525  ...screaming. 
English-HarryPotter02-526  Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories. 
English-HarryPotter02-527  Our pain becomes their power. 
English-HarryPotter02-528  I think it was my mother... 
English-HarryPotter02-529  ...the night she was murdered. 
English-HarryPotter02-530  The very first time I saw you, Harry I recognized you immediately. 
English-HarryPotter02-531  Not by your scar, by your eyes. 
English-HarryPotter02-532  They're your mother, Lily's. 
English-HarryPotter02-533  Yes. 
English-HarryPotter02-534  Oh, yes. I knew her. 
English-HarryPotter02-535  Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was. 
English-HarryPotter02-536  Not only was she a singularly gifted witch... 
English-HarryPotter02-537  ...she was also an uncommonly kind woman. 
English-HarryPotter02-538  She had a way of seeing the beauty in others... 
English-HarryPotter02-539  ...even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves. 
English-HarryPotter02-540  And your father, James on the other hand... 
English-HarryPotter02-541  ...he... 
English-HarryPotter02-542  He had a certain, shall we say talent for trouble. 
English-HarryPotter02-543  A talent, rumor has it he passed on to you. 
English-HarryPotter02-544  You're more like them than you know, Harry. 
English-HarryPotter02-545  In time, you'll come to see just how much. 
English-HarryPotter02-546  Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop. 
English-HarryPotter02-547  We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack. 
English-HarryPotter02-548  - You heard it's the most... - Haunted building in Britain. I know. 
English-HarryPotter02-549  What's going on? 
English-HarryPotter02-550  Probably Neville forgot the password again. 
English-HarryPotter02-551  - Hey. - Oh, you're there. 
English-HarryPotter02-552  Let me through, please. Excuse me! I'm Head Boy! 
English-HarryPotter02-553  Get back, all of you. 
English-HarryPotter02-554  No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched. 
English-HarryPotter02-555  The Fat Lady! She's gone! 
English-HarryPotter02-556  Serves her right. She was a terrible singer. 
English-HarryPotter02-557  It's not funny, Ron. 
English-HarryPotter02-558  Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours. Back to your common room. 
English-HarryPotter02-559  - Be quiet. - Make way. 
English-HarryPotter02-560  - The headmaster's here. - Come on, move. 
English-HarryPotter02-561  You heard. Move! 
English-HarryPotter02-562  Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts. 
English-HarryPotter02-563  Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady. 
English-HarryPotter02-564  There's no need for ghosts, professor. 
English-HarryPotter02-565  The Fat Lady's there. 
English-HarryPotter02-566  Mind where you're going! Slow down! 
English-HarryPotter02-567  You listen! I'm Head Boy! 
English-HarryPotter02-568  - Come back here! - Keep moving! 
English-HarryPotter02-569  Dear lady, who did this to you? 
English-HarryPotter02-570  Eyes like the devil, he's got and a soul as dark as his name. 
English-HarryPotter02-571  It's him, headmaster. The one they all talk about. 
English-HarryPotter02-572  He's here, somewhere in the castle! 
English-HarryPotter02-573  Sirius Black! 
English-HarryPotter02-574  Secure the castle, Mr. Filch. The rest of you, to the Great Hall. 
English-HarryPotter02-575  I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery. There's nothing there. 
English-HarryPotter02-576  - Thank you. - The third floor's clear too, sir. 
English-HarryPotter02-577  - Very good. - I've done the dungeons. 
English-HarryPotter02-578  No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle. 
English-HarryPotter02-579  I didn't really expect him to linger. 
English-HarryPotter02-580  Remarkable feat, don't you think? 
English-HarryPotter02-581  To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own... 
English-HarryPotter02-582  ...completely undetected? - Quite remarkable, yes. 
English-HarryPotter02-583  Any theories on how he managed it? 
English-HarryPotter02-584  Many. Each as unlikely as the next. 
English-HarryPotter02-585  You may recall... 
English-HarryPotter02-586  ...prior to the start of term I expressed concerns... 
English-HarryPotter02-587  ...about your appointment of Professor... 
English-HarryPotter02-588  Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it. 
English-HarryPotter02-589  I'm quite convinced the castle is safe... 
English-HarryPotter02-590  ...and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses. 
English-HarryPotter02-591  What about Potter? Should he be warned? 
English-HarryPotter02-592  Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep. 
English-HarryPotter02-593  For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own. 
English-HarryPotter02-594  Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud. 
English-HarryPotter02-595  Turn to page 394. 
English-HarryPotter02-596  Excuse me, sir. Where's Professor Lupin? 
English-HarryPotter02-597  That's not really your concern is it, Potter? 
English-HarryPotter02-598  Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching... 
English-HarryPotter02-599  ...at the present time. Turn to page 394. 
English-HarryPotter02-600  "Werewolves"? 
English-HarryPotter02-601  Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks. 
English-HarryPotter02-602  - We're not meant to start that for weeks. - Quiet. 
English-HarryPotter02-603  When did she come in? Did you see her come in? 
English-HarryPotter02-604  Now, which one of you can tell me the difference... 
English-HarryPotter02-605  ...between an Animagus and a werewolf? 
English-HarryPotter02-606  No one? 
English-HarryPotter02-607  - How disappointing. - Please, sir. 
English-HarryPotter02-608  An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. 
English-HarryPotter02-609  A werewolf has no choice. 
English-HarryPotter02-610  With each full moon... 
English-HarryPotter02-611  ...he no longer remembers who he is. He'd kill his best friend. 
English-HarryPotter02-612  The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind. 
English-HarryPotter02-613  Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. That's the second time... 
English-HarryPotter02-614  ...you've spoken out of turn Miss Granger. 
English-HarryPotter02-615  Are you incapable of restraining yourself... 
English-HarryPotter02-616  ...or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all? 
English-HarryPotter02-617  - He's got a point, you know. - Five points from Gryffindor. 
English-HarryPotter02-618  As an antidote to your ignorance and on my desk, by Monday morning... 
English-HarryPotter02-619  ...two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis... 
English-HarryPotter02-620  ...on recognizing it. - It's Quidditch tomorrow. 
English-HarryPotter02-621  Then I suggest you take extra care Mr. Potter. 
English-HarryPotter02-622  Loss of limb will not excuse you. 
English-HarryPotter02-623  Page 394. 
English-HarryPotter02-624  The term "werewolf"... 
English-HarryPotter02-625  ...is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"... 
English-HarryPotter02-626  ...which means "man," and "wolf." Werewolf, man-wolf. 
English-HarryPotter02-627  There are several ways to become a werewolf. 
English-HarryPotter02-628  They include being given the power of shape-shifting... 
English-HarryPotter02-629  ...being bitten by a werewolf... 
English-HarryPotter02-630  Go, Harry! Go, Harry! 
English-HarryPotter02-631  Aresto momentum! 
English-HarryPotter02-632  - He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he? - Peaky? 
English-HarryPotter02-633  What do you expect? He fell over 100 feet. 
English-HarryPotter02-634  Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like. 
English-HarryPotter02-635  Probably a right sight better than he normally does. 
English-HarryPotter02-636  - How are you feeling? - Oh, brilliant. 
English-HarryPotter02-637  You gave us a right good scare. 
English-HarryPotter02-638  - What happened? - Well, you fell off your broom. 
English-HarryPotter02-639  Really? I meant the match. Who won? 
English-HarryPotter02-640  No one blames you, Harry. 
English-HarryPotter02-641  Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious. 
English-HarryPotter02-642  After he saved you he sent them off. 
English-HarryPotter02-643  There's something else you should know too. 
English-HarryPotter02-644  When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and... 
English-HarryPotter02-645  Well... 
English-HarryPotter02-646  I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick. 
English-HarryPotter02-647  Is there no chance of fixing it? 
English-HarryPotter02-648  No. 
English-HarryPotter02-649  Professor, why do the dementors affect me so? 
English-HarryPotter02-650  - I mean, more than everyone else? - Listen. 
English-HarryPotter02-651  Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth. 
English-HarryPotter02-652  They feed on every good feeling every happy memory... 
English-HarryPotter02-653  ...until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences. 
English-HarryPotter02-654  You are not weak, Harry. 
English-HarryPotter02-655  Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past. 
English-HarryPotter02-656  Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine. 
English-HarryPotter02-657  You have nothing to be ashamed of. 
English-HarryPotter02-658  - I'm scared, professor. - I'd consider you a fool if you weren't. 
English-HarryPotter02-659  I need to know how to fight them. You could teach me. 
English-HarryPotter02-660  You made the one on the train go away. 
English-HarryPotter02-661  There was only one that night. 
English-HarryPotter02-662  - But you made it go away. - I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry. 
English-HarryPotter02-663  But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you... 
English-HarryPotter02-664  ...perhaps I should teach you. But after the holidays. 
English-HarryPotter02-665  For now, I need to rest. 
English-HarryPotter02-666  Last call for Hogsmeade! Come on, now! 
English-HarryPotter02-667  - Guys, let me go. - Clever, Harry. 
English-HarryPotter02-668  - But not clever enough. - We've got a better way. 
English-HarryPotter02-669  - I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade. - We know. 
English-HarryPotter02-670  We'll get you there. 
English-HarryPotter02-671  - We'll show you a quicker way. - If you pipe down. 
English-HarryPotter02-672  - Bless him. - Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't... 
English-HarryPotter02-673  - Now, Harry. - Come and join the big boys. 
English-HarryPotter02-674  What are you doing?! 
English-HarryPotter02-675  - What's this rubbish? - "What's this rubbish?" he says. 
English-HarryPotter02-676  - It's the secret to our success. - It's a wrench giving it to you... 
English-HarryPotter02-677  But we've decided your needs are greater than ours. 
English-HarryPotter02-678  George, if you will. 
English-HarryPotter02-679  I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. 
English-HarryPotter02-680  "Messrs. Moony, Wormtail Padfoot and Prongs... 
English-HarryPotter02-681  ...are proud to present the Marauder's Map." 
English-HarryPotter02-682  We owe them so much. 
English-HarryPotter02-683  Hang on. This is Hogwarts. And that... 
English-HarryPotter02-684  - No. Is that really...? - Dumbledore. 
English-HarryPotter02-685  - In his study. - Pacing. 
English-HarryPotter02-686  Does that a lot. 
English-HarryPotter02-687  - So this map shows... - Everyone. 
English-HarryPotter02-688  - Where they are. - What they're doing. 
English-HarryPotter02-689  - Every minute. - Every day. 
English-HarryPotter02-690  - Brilliant! Where did you get it? - From Filch's office. 
English-HarryPotter02-691  - First year. - There are seven secret passageways... 
English-HarryPotter02-692  ...out of the castle. - We'd recommend this one. 
English-HarryPotter02-693  - The One-Eyed Witch passageway. - Leads you to Honeyduke's. 
English-HarryPotter02-694  Hurry. Filch is heading this way. 
English-HarryPotter02-695  And don't forget. When you're done just give it a tap and say: 
English-HarryPotter02-696  "Mischief managed." Otherwise, anyone can read it. 
English-HarryPotter02-697  Now, how much do you want? 
English-HarryPotter02-698  Delicious. 
English-HarryPotter02-699  It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that? 
English-HarryPotter02-700  Twice. 
English-HarryPotter02-701  Do you want to move a bit closer? 
English-HarryPotter02-702  To the Shrieking Shack? 
English-HarryPotter02-703  Actually, I'm fine here. 
English-HarryPotter02-704  Well, well. Look who's here. 
English-HarryPotter02-705  You two shopping for your new dream home? 
English-HarryPotter02-706  Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee? Don't your family sleep in one room? 
English-HarryPotter02-707  - Shut your mouth, Malfoy. - Not very friendly. 
English-HarryPotter02-708  Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors. 
English-HarryPotter02-709  - Hope you don't mean yourself. - How dare you talk to me! 
English-HarryPotter02-710  You filthy little mudblood! 
English-HarryPotter02-711  Who is that? 
English-HarryPotter02-712  - Don't stand there! Do something! - What? 
English-HarryPotter02-713  What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis? 
English-HarryPotter02-714  Get out of the way! 
English-HarryPotter02-715  Move! 
English-HarryPotter02-716  Malfoy! Wait! Wait! 
English-HarryPotter02-717  Harry! 
English-HarryPotter02-718  Bloody hell, Harry. That was not funny. 
English-HarryPotter02-719  Those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map. 
English-HarryPotter02-720  He won't keep it. He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall. 
English-HarryPotter02-721  - Aren't you? - Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak. 
English-HarryPotter02-722  Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta. 
English-HarryPotter02-723  - Ron fancies her. - That's not true! 
English-HarryPotter02-724  - Professor McGonagall! - Cornelius! 
English-HarryPotter02-725  Allow me, minister. 
English-HarryPotter02-726  - Oh, Hagrid... - Sorry about that. 
English-HarryPotter02-727  Rosmerta, my dear. I hope business is good. 
English-HarryPotter02-728  It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors... 
English-HarryPotter02-729  ...into my pub every other night! - We have... 
English-HarryPotter02-730  - We have a killer on the loose. - Sirius Black in Hogsmeade! 
English-HarryPotter02-731  And what would bring him here? 
English-HarryPotter02-732  - Harry Potter. - Harry Potter? 
English-HarryPotter02-733  Come. 
English-HarryPotter02-734  Harry! 
English-HarryPotter02-735  - No underage wizards allowed in today! - Shut the damn door! 
English-HarryPotter02-736  - So rude. - Thick heads. 
English-HarryPotter02-737  - Thick heads?! - How dare they! 
English-HarryPotter02-738  - Who are they calling thick heads? - Young whippersnappers! 
English-HarryPotter02-739  Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits. 
English-HarryPotter02-740  Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place. 
English-HarryPotter02-741  Tell me what this is all about. 
English-HarryPotter02-742  Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death... 
English-HarryPotter02-743  Remember? They hid. Few knew where they were. 
English-HarryPotter02-744  One who did was Sirius Black. And he told You-Know-Who. 
English-HarryPotter02-745  Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night... 
English-HarryPotter02-746  ...he also killed Peter Pettigrew! 
English-HarryPotter02-747  - Peter Pettigrew? - Little lump of a boy. 
English-HarryPotter02-748  - Always trailing after Black. - I remember. 
English-HarryPotter02-749  Never let James and Sirius out of his sight. 
English-HarryPotter02-750  - What happened? - Peter tried to warn the Potters... 
English-HarryPotter02-751  ...and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black. 
English-HarryPotter02-752  Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew. 
English-HarryPotter02-753  He destroyed him! 
English-HarryPotter02-754  A finger. That's all that was left. A finger. Nothing else. 
English-HarryPotter02-755  Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters... 
English-HarryPotter02-756  ...but he's the reason they're dead. - He wants to finish things. 
English-HarryPotter02-757  - I don't believe it. - That's not the worst of it. 
English-HarryPotter02-758  - What could be worse? - This: Sirius Black was... 
English-HarryPotter02-759  ...and remains to this day... 
English-HarryPotter02-760  ...Harry Potter's godfather! 
English-HarryPotter02-761  Ron, look! 
English-HarryPotter02-762  - Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me. - Merry Christmas. 
English-HarryPotter02-763  Harry, what happened? 
English-HarryPotter02-764  He was their friend... 
English-HarryPotter02-765  ...and he betrayed them. 
English-HarryPotter02-766  He was their friend! 
English-HarryPotter02-767  I hope he finds me. 
English-HarryPotter02-768  Because when he does I'm gonna be ready! 
English-HarryPotter02-769  When he does, I'm gonna kill him! 
English-HarryPotter02-770  Harry. 
English-HarryPotter02-771  There you are. You came. 
English-HarryPotter02-772  Are you sure about this, Harry? This is very advanced magic... 
English-HarryPotter02-773  ...well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level. 
English-HarryPotter02-774  I'm sure. 
English-HarryPotter02-775  Well, everything's prepared. 
English-HarryPotter02-776  The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm. 
English-HarryPotter02-777  Did you ever hear of it? 
English-HarryPotter02-778  No? Well... 
English-HarryPotter02-779  A Patronus is a positive force. For the wizard who conjures one... 
English-HarryPotter02-780  ...it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him. 
English-HarryPotter02-781  But in order for it to work you need to think of a memory. 
English-HarryPotter02-782  Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory. 
English-HarryPotter02-783  Can you do this? Yes. Very well. 
English-HarryPotter02-784  Close your eyes. 
English-HarryPotter02-785  Concentrate. 
English-HarryPotter02-786  Explore your past. 
English-HarryPotter02-787  Do you have a memory? 
English-HarryPotter02-788  Allow it to fill you up. 
English-HarryPotter02-789  Lose yourself within it. 
English-HarryPotter02-790  Then speak the incantation Expecto Patronum. 
English-HarryPotter02-791  - Expecto Patronum. - Very good. 
English-HarryPotter02-792  Shall we? Wand at the ready. 
English-HarryPotter02-793  Expecto Patronum! 
English-HarryPotter02-794  Expecto... Expecto... 
English-HarryPotter02-795  Expect... 
English-HarryPotter02-796  Here we go. Come on. Sit up. Deep breaths. 
English-HarryPotter02-797  It's all right. I didn't expect you to do it the first time. 
English-HarryPotter02-798  That would have been remarkable. Here, eat this. You'll feel better. 
English-HarryPotter02-799  - That's one nasty dementor. - Oh, no, no, no. 
English-HarryPotter02-800  That was a boggart, Harry. A boggart. 
English-HarryPotter02-801  The real thing would be worse. Much, much worse. 
English-HarryPotter02-802  As a matter of interest what were you thinking? 
English-HarryPotter02-803  - Which memory did you choose? - The first time I rode a broom. 
English-HarryPotter02-804  That's not good enough. Not nearly good enough. 
English-HarryPotter02-805  There's another. It's not happy, exactly. 
English-HarryPotter02-806  Well, it is. 
English-HarryPotter02-807  It's the happiest I've ever felt... 
English-HarryPotter02-808  ...but it's complicated. - Is it strong? 
English-HarryPotter02-809  Then let's give it a try. You feel ready? 
English-HarryPotter02-810  Just do it. 
English-HarryPotter02-811  Expecto Patronum! 
English-HarryPotter02-812  Expecto Patronum! 
English-HarryPotter02-813  Yes! 
English-HarryPotter02-814  Well done, Harry. Well done! 
English-HarryPotter02-815  - I think I've had enough for today. - Yes. Sit down. Here. 
English-HarryPotter02-816  Eat this, it helps. It really helps. 
English-HarryPotter02-817  And just so you know, Harry... 
English-HarryPotter02-818  ...I think you'd have given your father a run for his money. And that... 
English-HarryPotter02-819  ...is saying something. 
English-HarryPotter02-820  I was thinking of him. 
English-HarryPotter02-821  And Mum. 
English-HarryPotter02-822  Seeing their faces. 
English-HarryPotter02-823  They were talking to me. 
English-HarryPotter02-824  Just talking. 
English-HarryPotter02-825  That's the memory I chose. 
English-HarryPotter02-826  I don't even know if it's real. 
English-HarryPotter02-827  But it's the best I have. 
English-HarryPotter02-828  - Beautiful day. - Gorgeous. 
English-HarryPotter02-829  Unless you've been ripped to pieces! 
English-HarryPotter02-830  Ripped to pieces? What are you talking about? 
English-HarryPotter02-831  - Ronald has lost his rat. - I haven't lost anything! 
English-HarryPotter02-832  - Your cat killed him! - Rubbish. 
English-HarryPotter02-833  Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers... 
English-HarryPotter02-834  ...is always lurking about. And Scabbers is gone. 
English-HarryPotter02-835  Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets! 
English-HarryPotter02-836  - Your cat killed him! - Did not. 
English-HarryPotter02-837  - Did. - Didn't. 
English-HarryPotter02-838  How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing? 
English-HarryPotter02-839  Well, first off, the committee members took turns... 
English-HarryPotter02-840  ...talking about why we were there. 
English-HarryPotter02-841  I got up and did my piece. Said how Buckbeak... 
English-HarryPotter02-842  ...was a good hippogriff always cleaned his feathers. 
English-HarryPotter02-843  And then Lucius Malfoy got up. Well, you can imagine. 
English-HarryPotter02-844  He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature... 
English-HarryPotter02-845  ...who would kill you as soon as look at you. 
English-HarryPotter02-846  And then? 
English-HarryPotter02-847  And then he asked for the worst did old Lucius. 
English-HarryPotter02-848  - They're not sacking you! - No, I'm not sacked. 
English-HarryPotter02-849  Buckbeak's been sentenced to death! 
English-HarryPotter02-850  Spiders! There's... There's spiders. Spiders. They want me to tap-dance. 
English-HarryPotter02-851  - I don't wanna tap-dance! - Tell those spiders. 
English-HarryPotter02-852  Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them... 
English-HarryPotter02-853  - Peter Pettigrew? - Little lump of a boy. 
English-HarryPotter02-854  - Always trailing after Sirius Black. - Black was vicious. 
English-HarryPotter02-855  He didn 't kill Pettigrew he destroyed him! 
English-HarryPotter02-856  - Put that light out! - Sorry. 
English-HarryPotter02-857  - Watch it there, boy. - We're trying to sleep here! 
English-HarryPotter02-858  Mischief managed. Nox. 
English-HarryPotter02-859  Potter. 
English-HarryPotter02-860  What are you doing wandering the corridors at night? 
English-HarryPotter02-861  I was sleepwalking. 
English-HarryPotter02-862  How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter. 
English-HarryPotter02-863  He, too, was exceedingly arrogant strutting about the castle. 
English-HarryPotter02-864  My dad didn't strut. And nor do I. 
English-HarryPotter02-865  If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand. 
English-HarryPotter02-866  Turn out your pockets. 
English-HarryPotter02-867  Turn out your pockets! 
English-HarryPotter02-868  What's this? 
English-HarryPotter02-869  - Spare bit of parchment. - Really? Open it. 
English-HarryPotter02-870  Reveal your secrets. 
English-HarryPotter02-871  Read it. 
English-HarryPotter02-872  "Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs... 
English-HarryPotter02-873  ...offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..." 
English-HarryPotter02-874  Go on. 
English-HarryPotter02-875  "And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business." 
English-HarryPotter02-876  - You insolent little... - Professor! 
English-HarryPotter02-877  Well, well. Lupin. 
English-HarryPotter02-878  Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we? 
English-HarryPotter02-879  Harry, are you all right? 
English-HarryPotter02-880  That remains to be seen. 
English-HarryPotter02-881  I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact. 
English-HarryPotter02-882  Take a look, Lupin. Supposed to be your area of expertise. 
English-HarryPotter02-883  - Clearly, it's full of dark magic. - I seriously doubt it, Severus. 
English-HarryPotter02-884  It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone... 
English-HarryPotter02-885  ...who tries to read it. I suspect it's a Zonko product. 
English-HarryPotter02-886  Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess. 
English-HarryPotter02-887  It is, after all, as you say my area of expertise. 
English-HarryPotter02-888  Harry, would you come with me please? Professor, good night. 
English-HarryPotter02-889  Are you deaf? Put that light out! 
English-HarryPotter02-890  Come in. 
English-HarryPotter02-891  I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession... 
English-HarryPotter02-892  ...but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in. 
English-HarryPotter02-893  Did it never occur to you that this in the hands of Sirius Black... 
English-HarryPotter02-894  ...is a map to you? 
English-HarryPotter02-895  - No. - No, sir. 
English-HarryPotter02-896  Your father never set much store by the rules either. 
English-HarryPotter02-897  But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours. 
English-HarryPotter02-898  Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected... 
English-HarryPotter02-899  ...with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them! 
English-HarryPotter02-900  Now, I will not cover up for you again. 
English-HarryPotter02-901  - Do you hear me? - Yes, sir. 
English-HarryPotter02-902  I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there. 
English-HarryPotter02-903  And don't take any detours. If you do, I shall know. 
English-HarryPotter02-904  Professor, just so you know I don't think that map always works. 
English-HarryPotter02-905  Earlier, it showed someone in the castle. Someone I know to be dead. 
English-HarryPotter02-906  Oh, really? And who might that be? 
English-HarryPotter02-907  Peter Pettigrew. 
English-HarryPotter02-908  That's not possible. 
English-HarryPotter02-909  It's just what I saw. 
English-HarryPotter02-910  Good night, professor. 
English-HarryPotter02-911  Broaden your minds. You must look beyond. 
English-HarryPotter02-912  The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye. 
English-HarryPotter02-913  Only then can you see. Try again. 
English-HarryPotter02-914  Now, what do we have here? 
English-HarryPotter02-915  Do you mind me trying? 
English-HarryPotter02-916  The Grim, possibly. 
English-HarryPotter02-917  My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class... 
English-HarryPotter02-918  ...I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit... 
English-HarryPotter02-919  ...for the noble art of Divination. No, you see, there. 
English-HarryPotter02-920  You may be young in years but your heart is as shriveled... 
English-HarryPotter02-921  ...as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books... 
English-HarryPotter02-922  ...to which you so desperately cleave. 
English-HarryPotter02-923  Have I said something? 
English-HarryPotter02-924  She's gone mental, Hermione has. Not that she wasn't always mental... 
English-HarryPotter02-925  ...but now it's in the open for everyone to see. 
English-HarryPotter02-926  Hang on. 
English-HarryPotter02-927  - We better take this back. - I'm not going back. 
English-HarryPotter02-928  - Fine. See you later. - See you. 
English-HarryPotter02-929  Harry Potter... 
English-HarryPotter02-930  - Professor Trelawney... - He will return tonight. 
English-HarryPotter02-931  Sorry? 
English-HarryPotter02-932  Tonight, he who betrayed his friends whose heart rots with murder... 
English-HarryPotter02-933  ...shall break free. 
English-HarryPotter02-934  Innocent blood shall be spilt... 
English-HarryPotter02-935  ...and servant and master shall be reunited once more. 
English-HarryPotter02-936  I'm so sorry, dear boy. Did you say something? 
English-HarryPotter02-937  No. 
English-HarryPotter02-938  Nothing. 
English-HarryPotter02-939  I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible. 
English-HarryPotter02-940  - It just got worse. - What did I say? Father said... 
English-HarryPotter02-941  ...I can keep the hippogriff's head. I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room. 
English-HarryPotter02-942  This is going to be rich. 
English-HarryPotter02-943  - Look who's here. - Come to see the show? 
English-HarryPotter02-944  You! You foul, loathsome evil little cockroach! 
English-HarryPotter02-945  Hermione, no! 
English-HarryPotter02-946  He's not worth it. 
English-HarryPotter02-947  Malfoy, are you okay? 
English-HarryPotter02-948  - Let's go. Quick. - Not a word to anyone, understood? 
English-HarryPotter02-949  - That felt good. - Not good, brilliant. 
English-HarryPotter02-950  Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them. 
English-HarryPotter02-951  Why don't we just set him free? 
English-HarryPotter02-952  They'd know it was me and then Dumbledore... 
English-HarryPotter02-953  ...would get into trouble. He's coming down, Dumbledore. 
English-HarryPotter02-954  Says he wants to be with me when they... 
English-HarryPotter02-955  When it happens. 
English-HarryPotter02-956  Great man, Dumbledore. 
English-HarryPotter02-957  A great man. 
English-HarryPotter02-958  - We'll stay with you too. - You'll do no such thing! 
English-HarryPotter02-959  Think I want you seeing something like that? No. 
English-HarryPotter02-960  You just drink your tea and be off. Oh. Before you do, Ron... 
English-HarryPotter02-961  Scabbers! You're alive! 
English-HarryPotter02-962  - Keep a closer eye on your pet. - I think you owe someone an apology. 
English-HarryPotter02-963  Right. Next time I see Crookshanks I'll let him know. 
English-HarryPotter02-964  I meant me! 
English-HarryPotter02-965  Blimey. What was that? 
English-HarryPotter02-966  Hagrid! 
English-HarryPotter02-967  Oh, crikey. 
English-HarryPotter02-968  No, minister. Over this way. 
English-HarryPotter02-969  It's late. It's nearly dark. You shouldn't be here. 
English-HarryPotter02-970  Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble. 
English-HarryPotter02-971  Particularly you, Harry. With you in a moment! 
English-HarryPotter02-972  Quick. Quick! 
English-HarryPotter02-973  Hagrid. 
English-HarryPotter02-974  - It'll be fine. It'll be okay. - Go on, go on! 
English-HarryPotter02-975  - That's ling you see over there... - On the slope. 
English-HarryPotter02-976  - On the slope... Ah, Hagrid. - Professor Dumbledore. 
English-HarryPotter02-977  - Good evening. - Minister. Make your way through. 
English-HarryPotter02-978  - Have a tea, if you like. - No, Hagrid. 
English-HarryPotter02-979  - Gentlemen. - I'd like a cup of tea. 
English-HarryPotter02-980  Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we? 
English-HarryPotter02-981  Very well. It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal... 
English-HarryPotter02-982  ...of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak... 
English-HarryPotter02-983  ...hereinafter called "the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown. 
English-HarryPotter02-984  - Dear, dear... - Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on. 
English-HarryPotter02-985  - All right. It'll be all right. - The execution shall dispatch... 
English-HarryPotter02-986  What? 
English-HarryPotter02-987  I thought I just saw... 
English-HarryPotter02-988  - Never mind. - Let's go! 
English-HarryPotter02-989  Buckbeak didn't mean no harm. 
English-HarryPotter02-990  Oh, no. 
English-HarryPotter02-991  He bit me. Scabbers. 
English-HarryPotter02-992  Ron. Ron! 
English-HarryPotter02-993  - Ron! - Scabbers, come back. 
English-HarryPotter02-994  Wait! 
English-HarryPotter02-995  - Scabbers, you bit me! - Harry, you do realize what tree this is? 
English-HarryPotter02-996  That's not good. Ron, run! 
English-HarryPotter02-997  Harry, Hermione, run! 
English-HarryPotter02-998  It's the Grim! 
English-HarryPotter02-999  - Harry! - Ron! Ron, wait! 
English-HarryPotter02-1000  Harry! 
English-HarryPotter02-1001  - Help! - Ron! 
English-HarryPotter02-1002  - Ron. Ron. - Ron! 
English-HarryPotter02-1003  Come on! 
English-HarryPotter02-1004  Move! 
English-HarryPotter02-1005  Duck! 
English-HarryPotter02-1006  Harry! 
English-HarryPotter02-1007  - Oh, I'm sorry. - Don't worry. 
English-HarryPotter02-1008  - Where do you suppose this goes? - I have a hunch. 
English-HarryPotter02-1009  I just hope I'm wrong. 
English-HarryPotter02-1010  We're in the Shrieking Shack aren't we? 
English-HarryPotter02-1011  Come on. 
English-HarryPotter02-1012  Ron. 
English-HarryPotter02-1013  - Ron. You're okay. - The dog. Where is it? 
English-HarryPotter02-1014  It's a trap. He's the dog. He's an Animagus. 
English-HarryPotter02-1015  If you want to kill Harry you have to kill us too! 
English-HarryPotter02-1016  No. Only one will die tonight. 
English-HarryPotter02-1017  Then it'll be you! 
English-HarryPotter02-1018  Are you going to kill me, Harry? 
English-HarryPotter02-1019  Expelliarmus! 
English-HarryPotter02-1020  Well, well, Sirius. Looking rather ragged, aren't we? 
English-HarryPotter02-1021  Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within. 
English-HarryPotter02-1022  Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you? 
English-HarryPotter02-1023  - I found him. - I know. 
English-HarryPotter02-1024  - It's him. - I understand. 
English-HarryPotter02-1025  - Let's kill him! - No! I trusted you! 
English-HarryPotter02-1026  And all this time you've been his friend. 
English-HarryPotter02-1027  He's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes. 
English-HarryPotter02-1028  How long have you known? 
English-HarryPotter02-1029  - Since Professor Snape set the essay. - Well, Hermione. 
English-HarryPotter02-1030  You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met. 
English-HarryPotter02-1031  Enough talk, Remus! Come on, let's kill him! 
English-HarryPotter02-1032  - Wait! - I did my waiting! 
English-HarryPotter02-1033  Twelve years of it! 
English-HarryPotter02-1034  In Azkaban! 
English-HarryPotter02-1035  Very well. Kill him. 
English-HarryPotter02-1036  But wait one more minute. Harry has the right to know why. 
English-HarryPotter02-1037  I know why. 
English-HarryPotter02-1038  You betrayed my parents. 
English-HarryPotter02-1039  - You're the reason they're dead! - No, it wasn't him. 
English-HarryPotter02-1040  Somebody did betray your parents... 
English-HarryPotter02-1041  ...somebody who, until quite recently I believed to be dead! 
English-HarryPotter02-1042  - Who was it, then? - Peter Pettigrew! 
English-HarryPotter02-1043  And he's in this room! Right now! 
English-HarryPotter02-1044  Come out, come out, Peter! 
English-HarryPotter02-1045  - Come out, come out and play! - Expelliarmus! 
English-HarryPotter02-1046  Vengeance is sweet. 
English-HarryPotter02-1047  How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you. 
English-HarryPotter02-1048  Severus... 
English-HarryPotter02-1049  I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle. Here's the proof. 
English-HarryPotter02-1050  Brilliant, Snape. 
English-HarryPotter02-1051  You've put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion. 
English-HarryPotter02-1052  If you'll excuse us Remus and I have business... 
English-HarryPotter02-1053  ...to attend to. - Give me a reason. I beg you! 
English-HarryPotter02-1054  - Don't be a fool. - He can't help it. It's habit. 
English-HarryPotter02-1055  - Be quiet. - Be quiet yourself! 
English-HarryPotter02-1056  You two, quarrelling like an old married couple. 
English-HarryPotter02-1057  Run along and play with your chemistry set! 
English-HarryPotter02-1058  I could do it, you know. 
English-HarryPotter02-1059  But why deny the dementors? They're so longing to see you. 
English-HarryPotter02-1060  Do I detect a flicker of fear? Oh, yes. 
English-HarryPotter02-1061  A Dementor's Kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like. 
English-HarryPotter02-1062  It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best. 
English-HarryPotter02-1063  Severus, please. 
English-HarryPotter02-1064  After you. 
English-HarryPotter02-1065  Expelliarmus! 
English-HarryPotter02-1066  - Harry! What did you just do? - You attacked a teacher! 
English-HarryPotter02-1067  - Tell me about Peter. - He was at school with us. 
English-HarryPotter02-1068  We thought he was our friend! 
English-HarryPotter02-1069  - No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him! - No, he didn't. 
English-HarryPotter02-1070  I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map! 
English-HarryPotter02-1071  - The map was lying, then. - The map never lies! 
English-HarryPotter02-1072  Pettigrew's alive! And he's right there! 
English-HarryPotter02-1073  - Me?! He's mental! - Not you! Your rat! 
English-HarryPotter02-1074  - Scabbers has been in my family for... - Twelve years? 
English-HarryPotter02-1075  Curiously long life for a common garden rat! 
English-HarryPotter02-1076  - He's missing a toe, isn't he? - So what? 
English-HarryPotter02-1077  - All they could find of Pettigrew was his... - Finger! 
English-HarryPotter02-1078  Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead! 
English-HarryPotter02-1079  - And then he transformed into a rat! - Show me. 
English-HarryPotter02-1080  - Give it to him, Ron. - What are you trying to do to him? 
English-HarryPotter02-1081  Scabbers! 
English-HarryPotter02-1082  Leave him alone! Get off him! What are you doing? 
English-HarryPotter02-1083  Remus? 
English-HarryPotter02-1084  Sirius. 
English-HarryPotter02-1085  My old friends! 
English-HarryPotter02-1086  Harry! Look at you. You look so much like your father. 
English-HarryPotter02-1087  - James. We were the best of friends... - How dare you speak to Harry! 
English-HarryPotter02-1088  How dare you talk about James in front of him! 
English-HarryPotter02-1089  - You sold James and Lily to Voldemort! - I didn't mean to! 
English-HarryPotter02-1090  The Dark Lord. You have no idea the weapons he possesses! 
English-HarryPotter02-1091  Ask yourself, Sirius! What would you have done? 
English-HarryPotter02-1092  - What would you have done? - Died, rather than betray my friends! 
English-HarryPotter02-1093  James wouldn't have wanted me killed! 
English-HarryPotter02-1094  Your dad would have spared me! He would have shown me mercy! 
English-HarryPotter02-1095  Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would. Together! 
English-HarryPotter02-1096  No! 
English-HarryPotter02-1097  - Harry, this man... - I know what he is. 
English-HarryPotter02-1098  But we'll take him to the castle. 
English-HarryPotter02-1099  - Bless you, boy. Bless you! - Get off! 
English-HarryPotter02-1100  I said we'd take you to the castle. 
English-HarryPotter02-1101  After that the dementors can have you. 
English-HarryPotter02-1102  Sorry about the bite. I reckon that twinges a bit. 
English-HarryPotter02-1103  A bit? A bit? You almost tore my leg off! 
English-HarryPotter02-1104  I was going for the rat. 
English-HarryPotter02-1105  Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog. 
English-HarryPotter02-1106  More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent. 
English-HarryPotter02-1107  The tail I could live with. But the fleas, they're murder. 
English-HarryPotter02-1108  Okay. 
English-HarryPotter02-1109  - You better go. - No. Don't worry, okay? 
English-HarryPotter02-1110  It's fine. I'll stay. 
English-HarryPotter02-1111  You go, I'll stay. 
English-HarryPotter02-1112  - You okay? - I'm fine. Go. 
English-HarryPotter02-1113  - That looks really painful. - So painful. 
English-HarryPotter02-1114  They might chop it. 
English-HarryPotter02-1115  I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat. 
English-HarryPotter02-1116  It's too late. It's ruined. It'll have to be chopped off. 
English-HarryPotter02-1117  It's beautiful, isn't it? 
English-HarryPotter02-1118  I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors. 
English-HarryPotter02-1119  It'll be nice to do it again as a free man. 
English-HarryPotter02-1120  That was a noble thing you did back there. 
English-HarryPotter02-1121  He doesn't deserve it. 
English-HarryPotter02-1122  I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends... 
English-HarryPotter02-1123  ...to become killers. 
English-HarryPotter02-1124  Besides, dead the truth dies with him. 
English-HarryPotter02-1125  Alive, you're free. 
English-HarryPotter02-1126  Turn me into a flobberworm. Anything but the dementors! 
English-HarryPotter02-1127  Ron! Haven't I been a good pet? You won't let them give me... 
English-HarryPotter02-1128  ...to the dementors, will you? I was your rat! 
English-HarryPotter02-1129  - Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't... - Get away from her! 
English-HarryPotter02-1130  I don't know if you know, Harry... 
English-HarryPotter02-1131  ...but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather. 
English-HarryPotter02-1132  I know. 
English-HarryPotter02-1133  I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle... 
English-HarryPotter02-1134  ...but if you ever wanted a different home... 
English-HarryPotter02-1135  What? Come and live with you? 
English-HarryPotter02-1136  It's just a thought. I can understand if you don't want to. 
English-HarryPotter02-1137  Harry! 
English-HarryPotter02-1138  Remus, my old friend. Have you taken your potion tonight? 
English-HarryPotter02-1139  You know the man you truly are, Remus! This heart is where you truly live! Here! 
English-HarryPotter02-1140  This flesh is only flesh! 
English-HarryPotter02-1141  Expelliarmus! 
English-HarryPotter02-1142  Harry! 
English-HarryPotter02-1143  Remus! Remus! 
English-HarryPotter02-1144  Run! Run! 
English-HarryPotter02-1145  - Come on. - Wait. Wait. 
English-HarryPotter02-1146  Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea. 
English-HarryPotter02-1147  Professor? 
English-HarryPotter02-1148  Professor Lupin? 
English-HarryPotter02-1149  Nice doggy. Nice doggy! 
English-HarryPotter02-1150  There you are, Potter! 
English-HarryPotter02-1151  Sirius! 
English-HarryPotter02-1152  Come back here, Potter! 
English-HarryPotter02-1153  Sirius! 
English-HarryPotter02-1154  No. Sirius! 
English-HarryPotter02-1155  Expecto Patronum! 
English-HarryPotter02-1156  Harry? 
English-HarryPotter02-1157  I saw my dad. 
English-HarryPotter02-1158  What? 
English-HarryPotter02-1159  He sent the dementors away. 
English-HarryPotter02-1160  I saw him across the lake. 
English-HarryPotter02-1161  Harry, they've captured Sirius. 
English-HarryPotter02-1162  Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss. 
English-HarryPotter02-1163  - They're gonna kill him? - No. It's worse. 
English-HarryPotter02-1164  Much worse. 
English-HarryPotter02-1165  They're going to suck out his soul. 
English-HarryPotter02-1166  Headmaster, stop them. 
English-HarryPotter02-1167  - They've got the wrong man. - It's true. Sirius is innocent. 
English-HarryPotter02-1168  - It's Scabbers who did it. - Scabbers? 
English-HarryPotter02-1169  He's my rat, sir. 
English-HarryPotter02-1170  He's not really a rat. He was a rat. He was my brother Percy's rat. 
English-HarryPotter02-1171  - But then they gave him an owl... - The point is, we know the truth. 
English-HarryPotter02-1172  - Please believe us. - I do, Miss Granger. 
English-HarryPotter02-1173  But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others. 
English-HarryPotter02-1174  A child's voice however honest and true... 
English-HarryPotter02-1175  ...is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen. 
English-HarryPotter02-1176  Mysterious thing, time. 
English-HarryPotter02-1177  Powerful... 
English-HarryPotter02-1178  ...and when meddled with dangerous. 
English-HarryPotter02-1179  Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower. 
English-HarryPotter02-1180  You know the laws, Miss Granger. 
English-HarryPotter02-1181  You must not be seen. 
English-HarryPotter02-1182  And you would do well, I feel to return before this last chime. 
English-HarryPotter02-1183  If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss. 
English-HarryPotter02-1184  If you succeed tonight... 
English-HarryPotter02-1185  ...more than one innocent life may be spared. 
English-HarryPotter02-1186  Three turns should do it, I think. 
English-HarryPotter02-1187  Oh, and by the way. 
English-HarryPotter02-1188  When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin. 
English-HarryPotter02-1189  Good luck. 
English-HarryPotter02-1190  What the bloody hell was that all about? 
English-HarryPotter02-1191  Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk... 
English-HarryPotter02-1192  What just happened? 
English-HarryPotter02-1193  - Where's Ron? - 7:30. 
English-HarryPotter02-1194  Where were we at 7:30? 
English-HarryPotter02-1195  I don't know. Going to Hagrid's? 
English-HarryPotter02-1196  Come on. And we can't be seen. 
English-HarryPotter02-1197  Hermione! 
English-HarryPotter02-1198  Hermione! Hermione, wait. 
English-HarryPotter02-1199  Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing? 
English-HarryPotter02-1200  You foul, loathsome evil little cockroach! 
English-HarryPotter02-1201  That's us. 
English-HarryPotter02-1202  Hermione, no! He's not worth it. 
English-HarryPotter02-1203  This is not normal. 
English-HarryPotter02-1204  This is a Time-Turner, Harry. 
English-HarryPotter02-1205  McGonagall gave it to me first term. 
English-HarryPotter02-1206  This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year. 
English-HarryPotter02-1207  - You mean we've gone back in time? - Yes. 
English-HarryPotter02-1208  Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment. 
English-HarryPotter02-1209  Clearly, something happened he wants us to change. 
English-HarryPotter02-1210  Good punch. 
English-HarryPotter02-1211  Thanks. 
English-HarryPotter02-1212  Malfoy's coming. 
English-HarryPotter02-1213  - Run. - Not a word to anyone, understood? 
English-HarryPotter02-1214  I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood! Mark my words. 
English-HarryPotter02-1215  - That felt good. - Not good, brilliant. 
English-HarryPotter02-1216  Come on. We should be at Hagrid's. 
English-HarryPotter02-1217  Look. Buckbeak's still alive. 
English-HarryPotter02-1218  Of course. 
English-HarryPotter02-1219  Remember what Dumbledore said? 
English-HarryPotter02-1220  If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared. 
English-HarryPotter02-1221  Let's go. 
English-HarryPotter02-1222  Here they come. I'd better hurry. 
English-HarryPotter02-1223  Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him. 
English-HarryPotter02-1224  Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free. 
English-HarryPotter02-1225  Scabbers, you're alive! 
English-HarryPotter02-1226  - Keep a closer eye on your pet. - That's Pettigrew. 
English-HarryPotter02-1227  - Harry, you can't. - He betrayed my parents. 
English-HarryPotter02-1228  - You don't expect me to sit here. - Yes, and you must! 
English-HarryPotter02-1229  Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now. 
English-HarryPotter02-1230  If you go bursting in you'll think you've gone mad. 
English-HarryPotter02-1231  Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time. 
English-HarryPotter02-1232  We can't be seen. 
English-HarryPotter02-1233  Fudge is coming. 
English-HarryPotter02-1234  And we aren't leaving? 
English-HarryPotter02-1235  Why aren't we leaving? 
English-HarryPotter02-1236  Are you mad? 
English-HarryPotter02-1237  That hurt. 
English-HarryPotter02-1238  Sorry. 
English-HarryPotter02-1239  We're coming out the back door. Go! 
English-HarryPotter02-1240  Is that really what my hair looks like from the back? 
English-HarryPotter02-1241  What? 
English-HarryPotter02-1242  I thought I just saw... 
English-HarryPotter02-1243  - Never mind. - Let's go. 
English-HarryPotter02-1244  Okay, go, Harry. Go! 
English-HarryPotter02-1245  Get away. Get off. 
English-HarryPotter02-1246  Minister, I really think I should sign as well. 
English-HarryPotter02-1247  Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be... 
English-HarryPotter02-1248  Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly. Come with us now. Come on. 
English-HarryPotter02-1249  Keep trying. Come on. Quickly. 
English-HarryPotter02-1250  Buckbeak. Okay? Quickly. Hurry up. Okay? 
English-HarryPotter02-1251  - Your name only. - It's such a very long name... 
English-HarryPotter02-1252  Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay? 
English-HarryPotter02-1253  Come on. Come on, Buckbeak. 
English-HarryPotter02-1254  Come and get the nice dead ferret. 
English-HarryPotter02-1255  - Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky. - Here we are, minister. Follow me. 
English-HarryPotter02-1256  - Now, look there. - Where? 
English-HarryPotter02-1257  - Look beyond the rocks. - What am I supposed to see? 
English-HarryPotter02-1258  Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster. 
English-HarryPotter02-1259  - Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed. - And all the strawberries. 
English-HarryPotter02-1260  - Come on, Buckbeak. Come on. - I see no strawberries. 
English-HarryPotter02-1261  - Over there. - Where? 
English-HarryPotter02-1262  - Over there. - This way. 
English-HarryPotter02-1263  - Let's get this over, please. - All right. 
English-HarryPotter02-1264  But where is it? 
English-HarryPotter02-1265  I saw the beast, just now. 
English-HarryPotter02-1266  - Not a moment ago! - How extraordinary. 
English-HarryPotter02-1267  Buckbeak. 
English-HarryPotter02-1268  Come now, Dumbledore. Someone's obviously released him. 
English-HarryPotter02-1269  - Hagrid? - Buckbeak. 
English-HarryPotter02-1270  I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this. 
English-HarryPotter02-1271  How could you? You've been with us all the time. 
English-HarryPotter02-1272  - Right. - Well, well. 
English-HarryPotter02-1273  We must search the grounds. 
English-HarryPotter02-1274  Well, search the skies if you must, minister. 
English-HarryPotter02-1275  Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy. 
English-HarryPotter02-1276  Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required. 
English-HarryPotter02-1277  Thank you. 
English-HarryPotter02-1278  You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor. 
English-HarryPotter02-1279  - Come on. - This way. 
English-HarryPotter02-1280  This way, now. 
English-HarryPotter02-1281  - Now what? - We save Sirius. 
English-HarryPotter02-1282  - How? - No idea. 
English-HarryPotter02-1283  - Look. It's Lupin. - Immobulus! 
English-HarryPotter02-1284  And Snape's coming. 
English-HarryPotter02-1285  And now we wait. 
English-HarryPotter02-1286  And now we wait. 
English-HarryPotter02-1287  - At least someone's enjoying himself. - Yeah. 
English-HarryPotter02-1288  - Hermione? - Yeah? 
English-HarryPotter02-1289  Before, down by the lake when I was with Sirius... 
English-HarryPotter02-1290  ...I did see someone. 
English-HarryPotter02-1291  That someone made the dementors go away. 
English-HarryPotter02-1292  With a Patronus. 
English-HarryPotter02-1293  I heard Snape telling Dumbledore. 
English-HarryPotter02-1294  According to him... 
English-HarryPotter02-1295  ...only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it. 
English-HarryPotter02-1296  It was my dad. 
English-HarryPotter02-1297  My dad conjured the Patronus. 
English-HarryPotter02-1298  - Harry, but your dad's... - Dead. I know. 
English-HarryPotter02-1299  I'm just telling you what I saw. 
English-HarryPotter02-1300  Here we come. 
English-HarryPotter02-1301  You see Sirius talking to me there? 
English-HarryPotter02-1302  - He's asking me to come live with him. - That's great. 
English-HarryPotter02-1303  When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'. 
English-HarryPotter02-1304  It'll just be me and him. 
English-HarryPotter02-1305  We could live in the country... 
English-HarryPotter02-1306  ...someplace you can see the sky. 
English-HarryPotter02-1307  He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban. 
English-HarryPotter02-1308  Harry! 
English-HarryPotter02-1309  Run! 
English-HarryPotter02-1310  Let's go. 
English-HarryPotter02-1311  - What are you doing? - Saving your life. 
English-HarryPotter02-1312  Thanks. 
English-HarryPotter02-1313  - Great. Now he's coming for us. - Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run! 
English-HarryPotter02-1314  That was so scary. 
English-HarryPotter02-1315  Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night. 
English-HarryPotter02-1316  Sirius. Come on! 
English-HarryPotter02-1317  - This is horrible. - Don't worry. 
English-HarryPotter02-1318  My dad will come. He'll conjure the Patronus. 
English-HarryPotter02-1319  Any minute now. 
English-HarryPotter02-1320  Right there. You'll see. 
English-HarryPotter02-1321  Harry, listen to me. No one's coming. 
English-HarryPotter02-1322  Don't worry, he will. He will come. 
English-HarryPotter02-1323  - Sirius. - You're dying... 
English-HarryPotter02-1324  ...both of you. 
English-HarryPotter02-1325  Harry! 
English-HarryPotter02-1326  Expecto Patronum! 
English-HarryPotter02-1327  You were right, Hermione. 
English-HarryPotter02-1328  It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was me! 
English-HarryPotter02-1329  I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before. 
English-HarryPotter02-1330  I knew I could do it this time because... 
English-HarryPotter02-1331  ...well, I had already done it. 
English-HarryPotter02-1332  - Does that make sense? - No. 
English-HarryPotter02-1333  But I don't like flying...! 
English-HarryPotter02-1334  Bombarda! 
English-HarryPotter02-1335  I'll be forever grateful for this... 
English-HarryPotter02-1336  ...to both of you. 
English-HarryPotter02-1337  - I want to go with you. - One day, perhaps. 
English-HarryPotter02-1338  For some time, my life will be too unpredictable. 
English-HarryPotter02-1339  And besides... 
English-HarryPotter02-1340  ...you're meant to be here. - But you're innocent. 
English-HarryPotter02-1341  And you know it. 
English-HarryPotter02-1342  And for now, that will do. 
English-HarryPotter02-1343  I expect you're tired of hearing this... 
English-HarryPotter02-1344  ...but you look so like your father. 
English-HarryPotter02-1345  Except your eyes. 
English-HarryPotter02-1346  - You have... - My mother's eyes. 
English-HarryPotter02-1347  It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little. 
English-HarryPotter02-1348  But know this: 
English-HarryPotter02-1349  The ones that love us never really leave us. 
English-HarryPotter02-1350  And you can always find them... 
English-HarryPotter02-1351  ...in here. 
English-HarryPotter02-1352  You really are the brightest witch of your age. 
English-HarryPotter02-1353  We have to go. 
English-HarryPotter02-1354  - Well? - He's free. We did it. 
English-HarryPotter02-1355  Did what? 
English-HarryPotter02-1356  Good night. 
English-HarryPotter02-1357  How did you get there? 
English-HarryPotter02-1358  I was talking to you there. And now you're there. 
English-HarryPotter02-1359  - What's he talking about, Harry? - I don't know. 
English-HarryPotter02-1360  Honestly, Ron. How can somebody be in two places at once? 
English-HarryPotter02-1361  Hello, Harry. 
English-HarryPotter02-1362  I saw you coming. 
English-HarryPotter02-1363  I've looked worse, believe me. 
English-HarryPotter02-1364  - You've been sacked. - No. 
English-HarryPotter02-1365  No. I resigned, actually. 
English-HarryPotter02-1366  Resigned? Why? 
English-HarryPotter02-1367  Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition. 
English-HarryPotter02-1368  This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want... 
English-HarryPotter02-1369  ...well, someone like me teaching their children. 
English-HarryPotter02-1370  - But Dumbledore... - He has already... 
English-HarryPotter02-1371  ...risked enough on my behalf. 
English-HarryPotter02-1372  Besides, people like me are... 
English-HarryPotter02-1373  Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now. 
English-HarryPotter02-1374  Why do you look so miserable, Harry? 
English-HarryPotter02-1375  None of it made any difference. 
English-HarryPotter02-1376  - Pettigrew escaped. - Didn't make any difference? 
English-HarryPotter02-1377  It made all the difference in the world. You uncovered the truth. 
English-HarryPotter02-1378  You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate. 
English-HarryPotter02-1379  It made a great deal of difference. 
English-HarryPotter02-1380  If I am proud of anything... 
English-HarryPotter02-1381  ...it is of how much you have learned this year. 
English-HarryPotter02-1382  Now, since I am no longer your teacher... 
English-HarryPotter02-1383  ...I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you. 
English-HarryPotter02-1384  So now I'll say goodbye, Harry. 
English-HarryPotter02-1385  I feel sure we'll meet again sometime. 
English-HarryPotter02-1386  Until then... 
English-HarryPotter02-1387  ...mischief managed. 
English-HarryPotter02-1388  Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle. 
English-HarryPotter02-1389  Harry. 
English-HarryPotter02-1390  Wherever did you get it? 
English-HarryPotter02-1391  Can I have a go, Harry? After you, of course. 
English-HarryPotter02-1392  - What are you talking about? - Quiet. 
English-HarryPotter02-1393  Let the man through. I didn't mean to open it, Harry. 
English-HarryPotter02-1394  It was badly wrapped. They made me do it. 
English-HarryPotter02-1395  Did not. 
English-HarryPotter02-1396  - It's a Firebolt. - It's the fastest broom in the world. 
English-HarryPotter02-1397  For me? 
English-HarryPotter02-1398  - But who sent it? - No one knows. 
English-HarryPotter02-1399  This came with it. 
English-HarryPotter02-1400  - Go on, Harry! - Yeah, let's see. 
English-HarryPotter02-1401  How fast is it, Harry? 
English-HarryPotter02-1402  Lumos. 
English-HarryPotter02-1403  I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. 
English-HarryPotter02-1404  Mischief managed.

English-BattleFieldVN01-2  Dien Bien Phu - The Legacy  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-3  Between 1945 and 1975, Indochina was racked...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-4  ...by one of the longest and most  bitter wars of the century.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-5  The battle for Vietnam drew in millions of soldiers  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-6  Vietnamese, French,  American Australian, Korean and British...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-7  ...and profoundly affected the lives of vast numbers of civilians.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-8  The American war, which lasted from 1960 to 1975  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-9  was a conflict fought with extreme ferocity and destructiveness.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-10  There was on the ground a guerrilla war, firefights  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-11  merciless search and destroy operations and endless sieges.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-12  And also an air war of extreme intensity.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-13  8 millions tons of bombs wroke havoc on the landscape and people.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-14  The war that cost 1.3 million lives including 58,000 American dead  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-15  was about much more than the fate of one small country.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-16  20 years before the first American combat soldier set foot in Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-17  ...the seeds for America's war had been sown.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-18  THE COLD WAR  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-19  With the partitioning of Europe, East and West after WWII...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-20  ...the Western powers were on the alert for communist gains...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-21  ...in the territories of the old empires.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-22  Soviet expansion in Europe was perceived as the greatest threat.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-23  In October 1949 Mao Tse Tung proclaimed the People's Republic of China.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-24  The battle lines of the Cold War were now clearly drawn.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-25  To American strategists, the communist victory in China...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-26  ...fueled the fear of Soviet and communist expansion.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-27  At stake, they believed, were economic interests throughout Asia and the Pacific...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-28  ...and U.S. communication and trade links to the Indian Ocean.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-29  President Eisenhower believed that one Asian country falling to communism...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-30  ...would bring down its neighbors in a Domino Effect.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-31  Soviet and Chinese power would advance Southwards...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-32  ...until even the Australian continent was threatened.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-33  It was Indochina that seemed to hold the key...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-34  ...to the future of Southern Asia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-35  The region bordered the newly created Chinese People's Republic  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-36  and was still a French colony.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-37  The French strategy was to hold on to power...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-38  by creating puppet states in Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-39  ...Laos...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-40  ...and Cambodia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-41  The biggest obstacle to the French plan was the Vietminh  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-42  a huge Vietnamese independence movement.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-43  In September 1945 under the leadership of Ho Chi Minh  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-44  the Vietnamese League for Independence known as the Vietminh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-45  ...took Hanoi from the Japanese occupying forces...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-46  ...and declared independence for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-47  In the South, the Japanese surrendered to the British.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-48  However, France still considered Vietnam her colony.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-49  General Gracey, the British commander, ordered the Japanese rearmed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-50  ...to fight the Vietminh to retake the colony.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-51  Thus the French Indochina war began.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-52  In the war between the French and the Vietminh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-53  The U.S. had until recently stayed strictly neutral.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-54  U.S. officials had originally supported the Vietminh and its leader Ho Chi Minh  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-55  and they also strongly opposed the French attempt to keep their old colony.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-56  However, that was before the rise of communist China.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-57  Now the fear was that if the Vietminh beat the French  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-58  they would open the door to the Chinese and the Soviets.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-59  Cold war politics had come to Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-60  DIEN BIEN PHU  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-61  The Soviet Union and China recognized the Vietminh  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-62  as the only legitimate government of Vietnam in January, 1950.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-63  Already China was giving Ho Chi Minh arms, ammunition and training bases.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-64  The US for its part recognized a French creation the state of Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-65  ...and US president Harry Truman approved a program...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-66  ...of military and economic help.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-67  But even before the order was signed the situation changed dramatically.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-68  In June, 1950 war broke out in Korea.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-69  Communist northern forces, backed by the Soviet Union and China...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-70  ...invaded the South, and the U.S. sent troops to intervene.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-71  By October, American units were locked in combat...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-72  ...with Chinese divisions on the Korean battlefield.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-73  Now it seemed to the US more important than ever...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-74  ...to contain China on every possible front.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-75  That meant a massive increase in backing for the French in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-76  By 1953, a year into the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-77  US support for the French war against the Vietminh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-78  ...had turned into a flood of arms and cash.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-79  The US paid 3/4 of the cost...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-80  ...a staggering one billion dollars in 1954.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-81  The problem was that even with colossal American aid...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-82  ...the French were failing to beat the Vietminh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-83  The guerrillas now numbered 120,000 trained troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-84  ...backed by 200,000 local fighters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-85  As French casualties passed 50,000...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-86  ...in France the public grew weary of the seemingly endless war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-87  There were calls for negotiations with the Vietminh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-88  Pressure for talks grew even greater as the conflict in Korea ended.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-89  But Eisenhower and his Vice President Richard Nixon...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-90  ...were dead set against any compromise.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-91  In spite of US opposition...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-92  ...some kind of peace effort in Indochina looked inevitable.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-93  The hope was that the French might win a major battlefield victory...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-94  ...and so strengthen their hand in any talks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-95  The result was a plan for a big offensive in late 1953.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-96  The main effort would be in Southern Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-97  but the French also meant to launch a blocking operation in the North...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-98  ...that just might deliver a major victory.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-99  By now vast tracts of French Indochina...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-100  ...had fallen under Vietminh control.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-101  In the Northeast of Vietnam the only French territory...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-102  ...was an enclave around Hanoi.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-103  The insurgence main military stronghold was on the Viet Bac...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-104  ...a mountainous region near the Chinese border.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-105  To the Vietminh, already in control of vast areas of Laos...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-106  ...its royal capital, Luang Prabang offered a tempting target  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-107  and the French were keenly aware of the danger.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-108  The French plan was to create at Dien Bien Phu deep in hostile territory...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-109  a  fortified base which would threaten the enemy supply lines to Laos.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-110  Just as important, the fort might act as bait...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-111  ...luring the Vietminh to attack with their best troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-112  The base could be supplied from Laos overland...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-113  ...and it could also be reinforced by air.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-114  The result they hoped for would be a set-piece battle that would allow...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-115  ...superior French firepower to inflict a decisive defeat on the Vietminh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-116  In late November 1953  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-117  the Vietminh 316th division advanced towards Laos  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-118  just as the French had expected.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-119  On November 20th, 800 elite French paratroopers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-120  ...including a battalion of the Foreign legion...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-121  ...would drop near Dien Bien Phu.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-122  The reaction of the Vietminh was to march elements of five more divisions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-123  ...towards the French camp.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-124  The French paratroopers at Dien Bien Phu...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-125  ...quickly set about building fortifications and an air strip.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-126  The idea was to mount offensive sweeps into the surrounding area...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-127  ...but soon the French were forced to think again.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-128  As the Vietminh massed around the base...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-129  ...it became suicidal to venture far outside.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-130  Within two months, as the noose around Dien Bien Phu was drawn ever tighter...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-131  ...even a fighting withdrawal was no longer an option for the French.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-132  Even though his forces were now surrounded...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-133  the French commander, Col. Christian De Castries was completely confident.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-134  He was certain that aircraft could supply all the base's needs.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-135  Only enemy artillery posed any real danger.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-136  Some Vietminh guns had begun to fire on the base...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-137  ...but the French were sure that only a handful...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-138  ...could have been deployed in such difficult hilly terrain.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-139  As for Vietminh's supplies and reinforcements...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-140  ...French air power would make sure they never reached Dien Bien Phu.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-141  Even though up to 100 French planes attacked Vietminh supply routes every day...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-142  ...their efforts were having little effect.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-143  Too often, aircraft were grounded by the weather  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-144  and in any case, the Vietminh were masters of camouflage...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-145  and deployed huge numbers of antiaircraft guns.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-146  In a massive effort over several months...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-147  Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, the Vietminh commander used 50,000 support troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-148  ...to deploy more than 200 artillery pieces and antiaircraft guns...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-149  ...and a vast supply of ammunition around Dien Bien Phu.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-150  It was one of the most extraordinary feats of logistics in military history.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-151  To the 10,000 French now inside the base, the realization...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-152  ...that they were surrounded by field guns and mortars...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-153  ...and 4 deadly soviet Katusha rocket systems came as a dreadful shock.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-154  The French base at Dien Bien Phu had been sited on a flat valley floor  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-155  The airstrip and headquarters were the focus...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-156  ...for the main battle position:  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-157  A complex of five strongholds codenamed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-158  Françoise, Huguette, Claudine Eliane, Domininque  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-159  To break up attacks, strong points Anne Marie  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-160  Gabrielle, Beatrice and Isabelle...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-161  ...had been created on a series of low hills.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-162  The base was manned by nine infantry battalions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-163  ...and two crack parachute battalions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-164  For support there were artillery and mortars...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-165  ...by tanks and fighter bombers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-166  By early march 1954...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-167  49,000 Vietminh had deployed around Dien Bien Phu.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-168  3 infantry divisions and 2 independent regiments...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-169  ...were supported by the field guns of the 351st heavy division...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-170  ...on the hills to the East, and by heavy mortars on all sides.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-171  Anti aircraft guns were secretly placed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-172  ...to cover the air routes in and out of the valley.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-173  As the weeks went on, Vietminh artillery caused more and more casualties...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-174  ...amongst the French at Dien Bien Phu.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-175  The fortifications had never been meant to withstand heavy artillery...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-176  ...and the French were horrified to find that neither counter battery fire...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-177  ...nor air strikes were able to silence the enemy guns.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-178  They were too well dug in to hill side caves and bunkers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-179  ...and too well camouflaged.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-180  Any day now, the French knew, they would face an all out enemy attack.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-181  It came on march 13th, 1954.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-182  The Vietminh assault began with a massive artillery bombardment.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-183  French gun positions in the central area were hammered.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-184  In three days after repeated human wave assaults...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-185  ...and hopeless French counter attacks  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-186  The Vietminh took the northern strong points of Beatrice, Gabrielle and Anne Marie.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-187  The loss of their northern outposts cost the French 1,500 men.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-188  The Vietminh had suffered much worse nearly 7,000 killed and wounded...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-189  ...but they had proved that the French defenses could be overcome.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-190  They had also closed down the base's main airfield for good.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-191  The French would now have to depend on parachute drops for supply and reinforcement.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-192  After a two week low, the Vietminh renewed their offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-193  The battle raged for a fortnight...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-194  ...with the French contesting every foot of ground.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-195  In the end, shocking Vietminh casualties forced Gen. Giap to pause.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-196  Meanwhile, the French situation was getting desperate.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-197  Ammunition and food was short  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-198  ...and 3,000 wounded were trapped inside the base in appalling conditions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-199  With disaster looming on the battlefield...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-200  ...the French appealed to the U.S. for help.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-201  There was a plan to use American bombers and even to drop 4 nuclear weapons  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-202  which was codenamed Operation Vulture.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-203  But Eisenhower ruled out any American military intervention...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-204  ...unless other allies took part.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-205  None agreed to help.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-206  The French at Dien Bien Phu were to be left to their fate.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-207  Although the outpost Isabelle was still on French hands  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-208  it was by now cut off from the central stronghold at Dien Bien Phu.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-209  Besieged by the Vietminh 304th division...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-210  ...Isabelle was under heavy artillery fire.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-211  Incredibly, although attacked time and time again  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-212  the post would hold out until the very end of the battle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-213  In the central sector, strong point Françoise had been abandoned...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-214  ...and the Vietminh had captured Dominique along with part of Eliane and Huguette.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-215  However, there were two new strong points: Sparrowhawk and Juno.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-216  Meanwhile, the Vietminh had adopted new tactics...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-217  ...in an attempt to reduce their terrible casualties.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-218  Secretly they had dug more than 50 miles of trenches...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-219  ...creeping right up to the French perimeter.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-220  The final Vietminh assault came on the night of may first 1954.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-221  After a massive barrage  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-222  the Vietminh infantry hit the remaining bunkers of Huguette and Eliane.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-223  In spite of fierce French resistance  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-224  positions fell one by one until on the evening of the sixth day...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-225  ...a huge mine demolished part of Eliane...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-226  ...and its last bunkers were overrun.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-227  At 5:30 PM of may 7th 1954 ...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-228  ...Vietnamese forces occupied the French command post...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-229  ...and the French commander ordered his troops to cease fire.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-230  It was 55 days to the minute since the battle had begun.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-231  At Dien Bien Phu, 3,000 French troops had been killed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-232  ...and 8,000 wounded.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-233  The Vietminh had suffered much worse with more than 8,000 dead...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-234  ...and 12,000 wounded.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-235  but for them the outcome had still been a triumph.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-236  On the eve of an international conference on Indochina  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-237  they had shuttered France's resolve to carry on the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-238  The Vietminh expected that the negotiations at Geneva  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-239  would open the way for full Vietnamese independence...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-240  ...and a major role for them in running the new country.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-241  In fact, the Vietminh negotiators faced bitter disappointment.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-242  Behind closed doors, Chinese prime minister Zhou Enlai...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-243  ...struck a deal with the French and forced Ho Chi Minh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-244  ...to agree that the country be divided into 2 zones.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-245  There was to be a cease fire  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-246  but there would be no immediate decision about...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-247  who was going to control Vietnam until elections settled the future.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-248  After Dien Bien Phu, the Vietminh had controlled 3/4 of Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-249  ...and parts of Laos and Cambodia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-250  At the peace conference Laos and Cambodia were confirmed as independent states...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-251  ...but Vietnam was divided at the 17th parallel.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-252  The Vietminh were given control of the northern part...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-253  ...the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with its capital in Hanoi.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-254  In the South, the state of Vietnam was to be run from Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-255  A Demilitarized Zone was established between the two regions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-256  By agreement 190,000 French led troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-257  ...would be withdrawn from North to South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-258  80,000 Vietminh troops in the South, mostly Southerners...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-259  ...would go to the North.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-260  For the French, the prospect of withdrawing...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-261  ...from the Northern part of Vietnam was deeply humiliating.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-262  However, they still assumed France would continue to play...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-263  ...a major role in the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-264  The illusion would not last for long.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-265  France's role was already being taken over by the United States.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-266  On September 8 1954, at a conference in the Philippines...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-267  the U.S. sponsored the creation of the South East Asia Treaty Organization...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-268  ...which would soon include South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-269  The Americans were now dealing directly...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-270  with the new South Vietnamese Government led by Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-271  They had begun to bypass the French completely.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-272  On October 9th, 1954...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-273  ...the Vietminh 308th division, veterans of Dien Bien Phu...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-274  ...marched in triumph into Hanoi in accordance with the Geneva agreement.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-275  At the same time, the last French troops in the North prepared to leave.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-276  With them went 850,000 refugees...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-277  ...encouraged by a CIA black propaganda campaign...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-278  ...and fearing for their future under Vietminh rule.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-279  Before the very eyes of the French and the Vietnamese people...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-280  Vietnam was crystallizing into two separate states each with its own government  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-281  ...its own army and its own cold war allies.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-282  THE LEADERS – North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-283  For Ho Chi Minh, the North Vietnamese president...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-284  ..the years following the Geneva agreement were bitterly disappointing.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-285  Ho was adored by millions of Vietnamese North and South...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-286  ...as the man who had driven out the French.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-287  But he had only won half the victory...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-288  ...South Vietnam, backed by the U.S. refused to hold the elections...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-289  ...that had been agreed at Geneva.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-290  The Elections Ho had counted on...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-291  ... and which the U.S. knew he would win to reunify the country.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-292  Everything pointed to the fact...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-293  ...that the division of Vietnam would be permanent.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-294  As a nationalist and founder of the Indochinese communist party...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-295  ...Ho Chi Minh was fast transforming North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-296  The party took control of almost every sphere of life.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-297  The reconstruction of the war ravaged economy...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-298  ...was pushed ahead at incredible speed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-299  One of Ho Chi Minh's highest priorities...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-300  ...was to get as much aid for North Vietnam as he could...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-301  ...from the Soviet Union and China.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-302  In July 1955 in Moscow, he won promises of cash help for the North...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-303  ...to stave off a food crisis  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-304  The Russians also pledged to send technicians and military advisors.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-305  at the same time China meant to match or even better the Soviet offer.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-306  Although Ho Chi Minh's biggest ambition was to reunify North and South Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-307  ...so far he had urged his followers to be patient.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-308  He had refused to back guerrilla warfare against the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-309  Both China and the Soviet Union were also insisting on caution.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-310  But by 1958, pressure to back an armed campaign was mounting.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-311  The tens of thousands of Southern Vietminh soldiers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-312  ...who came North after the Geneva accords were by now restless and homesick.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-313  There was more pressure from inside the South where the Vietminh that had stayed behind...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-314  ...were being wiped out by the new regime.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-315  In the Northern government an increasingly powerful faction of Southerners...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-316  led by Le Duan, the Communist Party General Secretary  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-317  was also arguing for strong measures.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-318  In January 1959 with Ho Chi Minh's blessing...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-319  ...the North Vietnamese Communist Party...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-320  ...voted to support armed revolution in South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-321  To help the campaign, 4,500 Vietminh Southerners...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-322  ...were prepared for infiltration back into the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-323  THE LEADERS – South Vietnam / United States  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-324  By 1957, two years after taking power in South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-325  Ngo Dinh Diem had impressed the United States.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-326  He had used the army forcibly against gangsters and armed religious groups.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-327  It had looked for a while as if President Diem could create...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-328  ...a viable non-communist state in South Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-329  ...and win the support of the Southern people.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-330  In fact Diem had no intention of introducing the democracy...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-331  ...or the social reforms that the United States wanted.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-332  He unleashed a savage campaign against his political opponents...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-333  ...using the army and Police to make mass arrests.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-334  There was widespread torture and summary executions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-335  At the same time Diem's own family built up enormous wealth and power...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-336  ...while most of the South Vietnamese continued to live in dire poverty.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-337  By September 1960 to the immense frustration of the United States...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-338  ...which was pouring in aid  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-339  Diem's regime was detested by vast numbers of South Vietnamese.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-340  There was already virtual civil war...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-341  ... with armed rebellions breaking out all over the country.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-342  Increasingly the revolts were being led by nationalist and communist guerrillas...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-343  ...and some trained men infiltrated down from the North.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-344  Over 12 months 1,400 local government officials and civilians...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-345  ...were killed, and a further 700 kidnapped.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-346  In South Vietnam the guerrillas began to mount bold attacks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-347  ...on military posts, convoys and railways.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-348  As events in South Vietnam spiraled towards chaos...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-349  ...in January 1961 John F. Kennedy took office...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-350  ...as the 35th president of the United States.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-351  Almost at once, Kennedy faced a series of Cold War crises.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-352  Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev was preparing to resume...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-353  ...atmospheric testing of atomic weapons.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-354  Khrushchev also promised to increase Russian support for communism around the world.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-355  The climax came in August 1961 with the tense standoff in Europe...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-356  ...as the Russians sealed off East Berlin and began to build the Berlin wall.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-357  Kennedy's reaction to the sense of mounting threat...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-358  ...was to order a massive strengthening of American defenses.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-359  He ordered the call up of 150,000 military reservists.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-360  A program was launched to build public nuclear fall out shelters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-361  ...right across the United States.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-362  There was a surge in arms production especially Strategic Nuclear Weapons.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-363  With so many immediate crises demanding the attention of the president...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-364  ...Vietnam was far down the White House agenda.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-365  All the same, concern was growing.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-366  The south Vietnamese guerrillas were now 17,000 strong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-367  In September 1961 there were 450 attacks..  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-368  ...some involving hundreds of guerrillas at a time.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-369  STRATEGY – The Vietcong  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-370  Shortly after the decision to mount an armed revolution in South Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-371  ...an organization had been created to control the military and political effort.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-372  This organization, the National Liberation Front,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-373  ...represented a wide range of political ethnic and religious groups.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-374  The military wing of the NLF was the People's Liberation Army.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-375  The army included guerrillas who had been sent down from North Vietnam,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-376  ...Vietminh veterans and local armed groups.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-377  The main purpose of the force was to support the political battle...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-378  ...and the civilian leaders of the front kept tight control.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-379  President Diem christened them the Vietcong,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-380  ...the Vietnamese communists, and the name stuck.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-381  The Vietcong meant to follow the same kind of political...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-382  ...and military strategy that had won the war against the French.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-383  Politics, diplomacy and Violence would be carefully coordinated...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-384  ...so each always worked with the others.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-385  For the time being, military activity...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-386  ...would take second place to the political effort.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-387  Many hoped that a full scale war would never be necessary.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-388  Others, particularly those closely connected with the North...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-389  ...saw a military campaign as the key to victory...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-390  ...and expected it to pass through three critical stages:  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-391  In the first phase of the revolution with the NLF's insurgence...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-392  ...greatly outnumbered by Saigon's army, the task for guerrilla units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-393  ...would be to survive in the face of government's attack.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-394  Safe base areas would be created as defensive sanctuaries...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-395  ...and as springboards for small scale guerrilla attacks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-396  In the second phase the insurgence would deploy larger units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-397  ...and would seek out bigger battles.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-398  The opposing forces would be more evenly balanced...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-399  ... and under relentless pressure, the enemy would become defensive and static.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-400  In the third phase, at the key moment when the NLF became stronger than the government army...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-401  ...they would launch large scale assaults against enemy installations...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-402  ...and seek out decisive conventional battles.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-403  In this phase the general offensive,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-404  ...combined with uprisings in the cities and towns...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-405  ...would bring the downfall of the Saigon regime and the reunification of Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-406  While the revolution was in its early phase,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-407  ...the NLF meant to build up its organization as fast as it possibly could.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-408  Political agents founded dozens of  associations...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-409  ...to bring every kind of support into the movement.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-410  There were associations for women farmers, students and workers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-411  In less than 2 years, the front claimed 300,000 members.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-412  At the same time as it built up grassroots support...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-413  ...the NLF meant to intensify its military operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-414  Bigger attacks on government forces would gain the movement prestige.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-415  Meanwhile intensive training and preparation by North Vietnamese officers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-416  ...would forge the Vietcong into an efficient and formidable fighting machine.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-417  STRATEGY – South Vietnam / United States  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-418  As the NLF tightened their grip on the countryside...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-419  ...the South Vietnamese army began to behave exactly as the guerrillas had expected them to.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-420  They grew increasingly defensive staying in fortified posts...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-421  ...and never venturing out after dark.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-422  Battles only happened when the guerrillas chose...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-423  ...and the army suffered a steady drain of casualties.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-424  By now there were 900 American military advisors in South Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-425  ...charged with building up and training the South Vietnamese armed forces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-426  They were appalled by the army's dismal performance against the guerrillas  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-427  ...but saw no reason why the South Vietnamese shouldn't be able to cope.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-428  What they wanted was a much more aggressive approach.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-429  American advice was that the army should get out...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-430  ...on mobile operations and find the bigger enemy units.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-431  The Civil Guard and militia could look after local security.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-432  The Americans developed a counter insurgency plan...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-433  ...supposed to better coordinate the different forces...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-434  ...but progress on the ground was painfully slow.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-435  While the handful of American personnel struggled...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-436  ...to improve the situation inside South Vietnam, in Washington...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-437  ...military planners worried about the external threat.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-438  The fear was that North Vietnam or even China...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-439  ...might take advantage of the South's weakness.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-440  Already, with the approval of the White House a contingency plan had been drawn up...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-441  ...for putting in American combat troops if an invasion looked imminent.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-442  If North Vietnam or China looked likely to invade the South...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-443  ...the American contingency plan OPLAN32 called for rapid deployments.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-444  A Marine expeditionary force would be based at Da Nang,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-445  ...an army division near Saigon  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-446  ...and another near Pleiku.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-447  Another division might be sent to bolster Thailand.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-448  If the invasion actually happened, U.S. forces...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-449  ...would be increased by another 3 divisions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-450  Aircraft carriers and land based bombers would be positioned...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-451  ...for massive attacks on North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-452  while amphibious, airborne and ground forces...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-453  ...would mount a full scale invasion of northern territory.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-454  By now, the guerrilla war in South Vietnam looked so dangerous...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-455  ...that American military planners believed the country might collapse...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-456  ...even  without a northern invasion.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-457  The Joint Chiefs of Staff the President's military advisors,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-458  ...argued that the best option was to implement OPLAN32 anyway...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-459  ...and put 3 divisions into South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-460  The first 20,000 men would show the United States was serious...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-461  ...they believed the rest, up to 70,000 troops would be enough...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-462  ...to clean up the guerrilla threat altogether.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-463  Although the secretary of defense Robert McNamara,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-464  ...was in favor of sending in troops president Kennedy had no desire...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-465  ...to embroil American soldiers in an Asian guerrilla war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-466  But neither could the president afford accusations...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-467  ...that he was soft on communism.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-468  In November 1961, Kennedy approved a compromise plan...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-469  ...drawn up between McNamara and the Secretary of State Dean Rusk.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-470  Phase I of the Vietnam plan would see a big increase...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-471  ...in financial support for the South Vietnamese army.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-472  The number of American military advisors in Vietnam would be raised to over 3,000.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-473  More American equipment would be sent, including helicopters  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-474  ...300 pilots to fly them and maintenance personnel.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-475  For the time being, the president put off a decision on the second phase....  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-476  ...the possible deployment of American combat troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-477  THE OPPOSING FORCES – South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-478  By the end of 1961, the South Vietnamese army...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-479  ...was being expanded to 200,000 men.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-480  South Vietnam also had marine units, a small air force...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-481  ...flying American aircraft, and a navy for coastal patrol.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-482  As well as the regular armed forces,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-483  ...there was the 68,000 men paramilitary Civil Guard, and various local militia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-484  Since the United States had started rebuilding the south Vietnamese army...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-485  ...back in 1955, the force had been organized armed and trained...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-486  ...to fight large scale battles.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-487  The danger had been expected to come from the North Vietnamese or Chinese armies,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-488  ... not from guerrilla bands.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-489  Commanders had been taught to mount big operations...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-490  ...and to use massive firepower wherever they could.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-491  In fact the south Vietnamese army's entire structure and military doctrine...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-492  ...had been copied wholesale from the United States armed forces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-493  Senior American commanders had no doubt...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-494  ...they were teaching the South Vietnamese the right tactics...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-495  ...for the war they had to fight.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-496  Their main worries were about leadership and morale.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-497  President Diem had appointed his generals for their political loyalty  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-498  ...rather than their abilities while junior officers promotions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-499  ...depended on family connections.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-500  As for the men, they were sometimes so poorly supplied...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-501  ...that they had to steal food.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-502  Desertions were running at 400 a month.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-503  THE OPPOSING FORCES – The Vietcong  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-504  As the NLF guerrillas began recruiting and training all over South Vietnam,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-505  ...they quickly built up their combat forces to 17,000 men and women.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-506  These were the main force troops uniformed and trained...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-507  ...to fight anywhere in units 100 strong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-508  Main force battalions were under the direct control...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-509  ...of the NLF high command and a high proportion of their officers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-510  ... were trained troops from the North.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-511  The NLF were also creating regional and local forces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-512  Regional troops were controlled by district commanders.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-513  They were less well armed and trained than the main forces...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-514  ...but their scattered units could come together...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-515  ...to create powerful formations wherever they were needed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-516  Local guerrilla units were based in the villages.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-517  They were part time soldiers whose main job...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-518  ...was to defend areas where the NLF was gaining control.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-519  In villages where the movement's influence was weaker...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-520  ...they served to intimidate opponents and show the wishes of the NLF...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-521  ...were always to be taken seriously.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-522  The vast majority of the new recruits to the NLF...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-523  ...were teenagers with no military experience.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-524  In the hamlets, they were organized by political officers into three person cells.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-525  Long ago the Chinese communists had found that 3 made for a group...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-526  ...more tightly knit and loyal than any other number.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-527  Although some weapons from the North including Chinese mortars...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-528  ...and machine guns, were beginning to reach NLF units,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-529  ...most guerrillas had to use whatever they could get.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-530  Rifles and equipment captured from the government's army...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-531  ...or leftover from the French war made up the bulk of the arsenal.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-532  There were also secret factories making small arms...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-533  ...and turning up grenades and mines in enormous numbers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-534  Local forces depended on even more primitive weapons.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-535  Some were designed mainly to frighten intruders...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-536  ...but others were extremely dangerous.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-537  Punji traps, sharp spikes hidden in pits...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-538  ...could easily disable an enemy soldier.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-539  Punjis were often contaminated to increase the risks of infection.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-540  WAR  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-541  By the end of 1961, the Saigon government was forced to admit...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-542  ...it was faced with a full scale war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-543  Every week, over 1,000 people were being killed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-544  All over the country, the NLF were organizing whole districts...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-545  ...along communist lines controlling education, health and agriculture.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-546  There were whole areas which had seen no government troops or officials for years.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-547  In spite of all the setbacks, American military advisors in South Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-548  ...were still confident the fight against the communists could be won.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-549  By this time they themselves were getting...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-550  ...more deeply involved in the battle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-551  Advisors were strictly forbidden to engage in actual combat...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-552  ...but the reality of war was starting to take over.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-553  On December 11th the helicopters promised by president Kennedy...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-554  ...arrived at the Saigon Docks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-555  With them came 400 US personnel to maintain and fly the aircraft.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-556  Within weeks, the helicopters and their American pilots...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN01-557  ...would be in action on the Vietnamese battlefield.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-1  BATTLEFIELD VIETNAM  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-2  The Undeclared War  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-3  In early 1962 the helicopters sent to Vietnam by President Kennedy...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-4  ...flew their first combat missions against the NLF.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-5  In Operation Chopper, the aircraft flown by U.S. Army pilots...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-6  ...ferried 1,000 South Vietnamese soldiers to sweep an NLF stronghold near Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-7  It was the beginning of a whole new phase of the conflict.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-8  From the start the American helicopters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-9  ...had a dramatic effect on the fighting.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-10  Government troops could take the guerrillas by surprise...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-11  ...or cut off their line of retreat after a battle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-12  Often they panicked and were killed while trying to escape.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-13  In the first months of 1962, the South Vietnamese army won a string of victories,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-14  ...badly shaking the NLF's morale.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-15  Using helicopters for offensive operations...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-16  ...called for a whole new set of tactics.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-17  It was a complex business in which helicopter forces and ground units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-18  ...had to  be strictly coordinated but the aim was simple  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-19  ...the enemy had to be found, fixed in position, and then defeated.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-20  Government troops called it 'spear and net'.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-21  Later it would become known as 'Search and Destroy'.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-22  A Search and Destroy operation usually began...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-23  ...with intelligence locating an NLF unit.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-24  The task then was to place forces to cut off the enemy's retreat.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-25  If there was a river nearby, South Vietnamese gunboats...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-26  ...were deployed in blocking positions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-27  Infantry on foot and on armored personnel carriers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-28  ...were moved in overland.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-29  Meanwhile, American helicopters loaded up with government troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-30  rendezvous with an escort of ground attack aircraft.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-31  After bombing or artillery strikes, the airborne infantry...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-32  ...landed and advanced towards the enemy acting as the offensive spear.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-33  Trapped by the net of blocking forces, the Vietcong...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-34  ...would be forced to do battle and be destroyed by vastly superior firepower...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-35  ...or so the theory went.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-36  The instant success of helicopter operations seemed to prove...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-37  ...that the approach favored by the Americans was the right one.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-38  What U.S. advisors wanted now...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-39  ...was more and bigger offensive operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-40  The greatest need was for more helicopters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-41  ...and the Americans quickly provided them.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-42  A series of government victories followed and soon it looked...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-43  ...as if the South Vietnamese army might in the not too distant future,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-44  ...actually defeat the guerrillas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-45  In July, 1962 General Paul D. Harkins,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-46  ...head of the US military assistance command in Saigon,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-47  ...reported to Washington that tremendous progress was being made in South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-48  It was just what president Kennedy wanted to hear,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-49  ...and in the White House there was a deep sense of relief.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-50  They hoped they could bring home...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-51  ...all U.S. military personnel by the end of 1965.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-52  CHINA  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-53  To Ho Chi Minh and the leaders of North Vietnam,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-54  ...the big increase in American military support for the South was deeply troubling.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-55  Did the U.S. mean to put in combat troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-56  ...or perhaps even invade the north itself?  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-57  They appealed to the Chinese leader Mao Tse Tung for help.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-58  Mao was anxious to be seen as the champion...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-59  ...of liberation movements around the world.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-60  He was also determined to counter the American strategy in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-61  In the summer of 1962, the Chinese leader promised Ho Chi Minh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-62  ...substantial support for the guerrilla war against the Southern government.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-63  Right away, North Vietnam would get 90,000 extra rifles for the Vietcong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-64  As yet the Americans knew nothing of the Chinese decision to back the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-65  They were still highly optimistic.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-66  Although the NLF were not being beaten on the battlefield,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-67  ...and it managed to hit over 2,500 hamlets in 1962 alone,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-68  ...pacification programs designed to increase government control...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-69  ...over the countryside, promised real progress in the villages.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-70  In a program coordinated by the Central Intelligence Agency,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-71  ...U.S. special forces were working with mountain yard travel groups...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-72  ...in the central highlands of South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-73  They fortified villages and trained local volunteers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-74  ...to fight the Vietcong in their own areas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-75  The tactics involved setting ambushes heavy night patrolling...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-76  ...and above all, responding fast to guerrilla incidents.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-77  The civilian irregular defense forces created by the American teams...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-78  ...were highly effective.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-79  The NLF found it increasingly difficult to organize openly amongst the population.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-80  At its peak, the program would encompass thousands of villages...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-81  ...and hundreds of thousands of people.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-82  While the effort in the Highlands was entirely an American initiative,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-83  ...further South, the Saigon government had embarked on its own pacification program.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-84  Backed by the CIA called the Strategic hamlets Program,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-85  ...the idea was to create 11,000 settlements...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-86  ...which could defend themselves from the Vietcong...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-87  ...and bring government authority into the countryside.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-88  The campaign was a disaster from the start.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-89  Instead of winning the voluntary cooperation of villagers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-90  ...the government embarked on a crash program of forced resettlement.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-91  Families were moved, sometimes at gunpoint,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-92  ...from the traditional lands and the burial grounds of their ancestors.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-93  Funds promised for development were embezzled by corrupt officials.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-94  Soon, the strategic hamlets came to be seen by their inhabitants...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-95  ...as little better than prisons.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-96  The result was a massive upsurge in support for the NLF...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-97  ...who vowed to destroy the strategic hamlets by every means possible.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-98  AP BAC  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-99  From the first introduction of American helicopters into South Vietnam,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-100  ...NLF tacticians had worked feverishly...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-101  ...to develop ways of dealing with the threat.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-102  They had learned to mount ambushes with heavy machine guns...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-103  ...near the obvious landing zones.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-104  They also practiced breaking up their larger units at high speed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-105  ...and melting into the forests or swamps at the first sign of an enemy sweep.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-106  One of the bigger lessons learned by the guerrillas in 1962...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-107  ...was to keep their attacks short.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-108  Raids or ambushes were planned to last no more than 15 minutes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-109  The idea was that even with helicopters, government forces...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-110  ...would have too little time to react.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-111  Slowly, by using their new tactics the Vietcong had recovered their confidence.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-112  So much so that by the start of 1963 they were able...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-113  ...to inflict a shattering defeat...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-114  ...on a South Vietnamese army air mobile operation.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-115  The hamlet of Ap Tan Thoi in the Mekong delta...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-116  ... was believed by the South Vietnamese army to be the location...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-117  ...of a Vietcong headquarters, a radio transmitter...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-118  ...and a small guerrilla force.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-119  The Army's 7th division, with American advice, decided to attack.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-120  What they didn't know is that they were walking into a trap.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-121  The South Vietnamese army were lured in, so the NLF...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-122  ...could for the first time test their effectiveness...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-123  ...against militia and airborne units.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-124  The operation was launched on January 2nd of 1963.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-125  The neighboring hamlets of Ap Tan Thoi and Ap Bac were strung out...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-126  ...along a rice dike and an irrigation canal.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-127  In the tree line was deployed the whole of Vietcong 514th battalion...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-128  ...reinforced by local guerrillas. Altogether nearly 350 men.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-129  The 11th regiment of the South Vietnamese army landed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-130  ...north of Ap Tan Thoi and exchanged fire with the Vietcong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-131  Meanwhile, a Civil Guard task force pushing from the South...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-132  ...ran straight into the Vietcong at Ap Bac and was stopped in its tracks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-133  Air and artillery strikes were directed at both hamlets,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-134  ...but the Vietcong were well dug in.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-135  A reserve company of Army troops was landed in transport helicopters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-136  ...to attack Ap Tan Thoi.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-137  Fire from Ap Bac destroyed 5 aircraft.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-138  Next, a company of Armored Personnel Carriers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-139  ...made a disorganized assault on Ap Bac,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-140  ...but was driven off with heavy losses.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-141  Airborne reinforcements were dropped in the wrong place...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-142  ...by the army commander.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-143  This allowed the Vietcong to escape and avoided further government casualties.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-144  For the Vietcong the battle of Ap Bac was a stunning victory.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-145  For the first time, they had stood their ground...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-146  ...against helicopters and armored vehicles.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-147  Almost 500 South Vietnamese troops were killed or wounded.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-148  Three American advisors were also killed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-149  ...and they had lost only 9 men themselves.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-150  As the news swept through the hamlets and villages of Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-151  ...Vietcong morale and recruitment soared.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-152  After Ap Bac, the guerrillas sharply accelerated...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-153  ...the tempo of their operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-154  Attacks on strategic hamlets were launched almost every day,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-155  ...and hundreds were overrun.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-156  The guerrillas hit isolated government forts,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-157  ...tempting sources of arms and radios.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-158  Usually they set ambushes for any army troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-159  ...that might be sent to the rescue.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-160  The South Vietnamese army's attempts to find the Vietcong's big units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-161  ...and make them fight, seemed increasingly futile.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-162  One major sweep after another failed to find the guerrillas in any numbers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-163  By now many American advisors in South Vietnam,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-164  ...Colonels and Captains at the sharp end of the battle...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-165  ...had begun to ask questions about the U.S. military doctrine.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-166  They were training the South Vietnamese to depend on big operations...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-167  ...and very heavy firepower.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-168  As a result, large numbers of civilians were being killed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-169  ...which could only increase support for the NLF.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-170  And in spite of everything the guerrillas were usually escaping the net.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-171  What the advisors wanted were tactics more like those...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-172  ...the Special forces had adopted in the central highlands.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-173  Small units patrolling, ambushes, and night operations...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-174  ...all the time working closely with local people.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-175  In Washington the suggestion met with some hostility.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-176  As far as the generals were concerned,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-177  ...the job was to find the enemy and destroy him...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-178  ...with as much firepower as could be mustered.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-179  CHAOS  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-180  For years, president Diem had filled the ranks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-181  ...of South Vietnam government officials with fellow catholics,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-182  ...enraging the majority Buddhist population.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-183  From the beginning of May 1963 there were widespread protests.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-184  Diem reacted violently.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-185  The army raided temples.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-186  Monks, nuns and priests were arrested,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-187  ...and demonstrators were shot in the streets by police.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-188  In July students began their own mass actions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-189  ...in support for the Budhist cause.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-190  By the fall of 1963, South Vietnam was sliding into political chaos.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-191  As sheer mismanagement looked set to destroy the country,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-192  ...army generals, directed by the CIA,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-193  ...hatched a plan to overthrow the president.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-194  American officials, exasperated at Diem's failures...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-195  ...signaled that Washington would not oppose a coup.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-196  The plotters made their move on November 1st 1963  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-197  ...attacking the presidential palace with armor and aircraft.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-198  The generals had promised that president Diem...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-199  ...would be allowed to safe flight into exile.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-200  However, the day after the coup Diem was brutally murdered...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-201  ...along with his brother Nu by unidentified assassins.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-202  Three weeks later on November 22nd 1963 in the United States,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-203  ...president Kennedy was himself assassinated.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-204  Kennedy's place was taken by his vice-president, Lyndon Baines Johnson.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-205  Johnson had always been wary of America's involvement with Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-206  Now he had inherited a strong U.S. commitment to the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-207  Whatever his private doubts, it was a commitment he was determined to honor.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-208  The chaos that had engulfed South Vietnam in the closing months of 1963...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-209  ...were seen in North Vietnam as a golden opportunity.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-210  Ho Chi Minh and most of his fellow leaders saw the chance...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-211  ...of a quick victory if the war was stepped up fast.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-212  Amongst the North's communist backers the Soviet Union was opposed to any escalation  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-213  But the Chinese leader Mao Tse Tung had promised his support.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-214  If the Americans reacted by invading North Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-215  ...China would even deploy combat troops to help the defense.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-216  In December 1963 in Hanoi, the Central committee of the Communist Party...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-217  ...approved measures to intensify the war in South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-218  General Giap, the Defense Minister had argued for precaution,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-219  ...but most of the leadership was against him.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-220  The order was given to speed up the flow...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-221  ...of men and weapons to the NLF in the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-222  In 1959 a specialized North Vietnamese Army unit, group 559,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-223  ...had been formed to create a supply route...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-224  ...from the North to the VC in South  Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-225  Jungle trails inside the South had proved too vulnerable...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-226  ...to government army sweeps and so helped by their allies,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-227  ...the Pathet Lao guerrillas in Laos...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-228  ...and with the tacit approval of prince Sihanouk of Cambodia  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-229  ...group 559 had taken over the border areas just outside South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-230  A primitive route was developed soon known as the Ho Chi Minh trail,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-231  ...with offshoots into Vietnam along its entire length.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-232  By early 1964, the trail was being transformed into a secret jungle highway...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-233  with Depots, air defense, and garrisons of permanent logistics troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-234  Meanwhile, another unit, group 579 controlled the infiltration...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-235  ...of men and weapons into South Vietnam by sea.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-236  In the first months of 1964 the NLF stepped up their campaign...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-237  ...in a concerted effort to push South Vietnam to the edge.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-238  With better equipment, leadership and training,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-239  ...the NLF were now attacking in big units up to 1,000 men at a time.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-240  As the guerrillas sensed the victory and piled on the pressure,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-241  ...on January 30th there was yet another military coup in Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-242  The U.S. defense secretary, Robert McNamara was dispatched to Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-243  ...to boost the authority of the new leader General Nguyen Khanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-244  Yet few American officials imagined Khanh could soon...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-245  ... win popular support or rally the demoralized South Vietnamese army.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-246  As the crisis in Vietnam deepened the pressure on President Johnson...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-247  ...to take strong action grew almost intolerable.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-248  Many of Johnson's political opponents,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-249  ...including the Republican Senator Barry Goldwater,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-250  ...were calling for North Vietnam to be bombed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-251  ...and for US troops to be sent to fight in the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-252  The Joint Chiefs of Staff were also insisting...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-253  ...that decisive military action would have to be taken to pressure Hanoi.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-254  From the start, Johnson doubted that United States...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-255  ...could win a war in Southeast Asia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-256  He also believed that neither congress nor the American people...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-257  ...would approve of open military intervention.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-258  However he did agree to covert actions against North Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-259  ...including secret bombing of economic targets and villages along the Laotian border.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-260  With support from American warships the South Vietnamese Navy...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-261  ...began a series of commando raids...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-262  ...on North Vietnamese coastal installations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-263  It was one such operation in August 1964...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-264  ...that would set the stage for a dramatic clash...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-265  ...between U.S. and North Vietnamese naval forces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-266  In the Gulf of Tonkin, the simmering conflict between United States...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-267  ...and Hanoi would sense spiraling towards outright war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-268  On the night of 30th July 1964 South Vietnamese commandos...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-269  ...attacked two small North Vietnamese islands in the Gulf of Tonkin.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-270  The US destroyer Maddox an electronic spy ship,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-271  ...was 123 miles south with orders to electronically simulate an air attack...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-272  ...to draw North Vietnamese boats away from the commandos.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-273  On August 2nd, three North Vietnamese torpedo boats...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-274  ...approached the Maddox at high speed,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-275  ...mistaking it for a South Vietnamese escort vessel.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-276  In the engagement that followed the Maddox sank one of the craft...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-277  ...and air support planes damaged the others.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-278  Maddox continued operations reinforced by a second destroyer...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-279  ...the USS Turner Joy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-280  Two nights later, still gathering intelligence and in bad weather conditions,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-281  ...the captain of the Maddox reported that he thought they had been fired on...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-282  ...and were about to be attacked.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-283  As he later reported, no attack took place.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-284  The possibility that a second attack had been imagined by ten sailors...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-285  ...in poor weather conditions was considered and rejected in the White House.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-286  Six hours after the supposed attack a retaliation against North Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-287  ...was ordered by President Johnson.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-288  American Jets bombed two naval bases.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-289  A major oil facility was also destroyed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-290  Two U.S. aircraft were lost in the raids.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-291  Within hours of the American air strikes the Chinese premier Zhou Enlai...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-292  ...was calling on the Vietnamese to prepare to fight back.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-293  Chinese air units on the Vietnam border were heavily reinforced.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-294  Frantic efforts were made to improve North Vietnam's anti aircraft defenses.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-295  At the same time jets of the fledging North Vietnamese air force...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-296  ...returned to Vietnam from their training base in China.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-297  The same day that North Vietnamese fighters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-298  ...began operations from their new home airfield,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-299  ...an historic step was taken in Washington.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-300  On August 7th 1964 the U.S. congress passed the Tonkin Gulf Resolution.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-301  It gave President Johnson the freedom to take whatever actions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-302  ...he thought necessary to defend Southeast Asia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-303  Johnson now had the power to use military force in Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-304  ...in almost any way he chose.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-305  THE NVA  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-306  In North Vietnam there was a growing fear that United States meant...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-307  ...to deploy troops in the South and perhaps even invade the North itself.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-308  The U.S. might also decide to bomb North Vietnam into the ground.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-309  Communist leaders could only hope that fear of China...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-310  ...would make the enemy hesitate before taking any drastic steps.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-311  Meanwhile, a bold stroke might win the war in the South...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-312  ...before the Americans could intervene.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-313  The plan was that the North Vietnamese Army should be sent to fight in the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-314  Supplying them would be no easy task, but their well trained...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-315  ...and  heavily armed regiments just might tip the balance.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-316  The aim was to topple the weakened South Vietnamese state...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-317  ...within little more than a year.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-318  The first North Vietnamese Army units to be raised and trained...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-319  ...for combat in the South were the 32nd and the 33rd regiments...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-320  ...of the 325th division based at Dung Hoi.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-321  The 66th regiment of the 304th would follow next.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-322  The plan was that, starting in October...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-323  ...the troops would march for 6 weeks down the Ho Chi Minh trail...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-324  ...and enter South Vietnam's Central Highlands in early 1965.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-325  The first step would be to seize territory in the border area.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-326  At the same time the Vietcong would take over...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-327  ...the coastal provinces of Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-328  The NVA would then advance along the line of highway 19...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-329  ...between Pleiku and Qui Nhon splitting South Vietnam in two.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-330  Meanwhile, the Vietcong would mount big attacks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-331  ...in the Mekong delta and around Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-332  Victories there would open the way for a general offensive...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-333  ...and trigger a popular uprising which would sweep away the Saigon Government.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-334  While the North Vietnamese army prepared its divisions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-335  ...for infiltration into the South the NLF stepped up their campaign.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-336  One of their main aims now was to deter the United States...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-337  ...from getting more deeply involved in the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-338  With the U.S. presidential election coming up, reminding Americans...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-339  ...that intervention had a price just might pay dividends.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-340  On November 1st 1964, only two days before the election,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-341  ...Ben Hua airbase near Saigon was blasted by Vietcong mortars.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-342  Four Americans were killed and 76 wounded.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-343  Five B57 bombers were destroyed and 15 damaged.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-344  Although the attack seemed a blatant provocation President Johnson was determined...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-345  ...not to react in a way that might endanger his election chances.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-346  This restraint seemed to have paid off handsomely...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-347  ...when on November 3rd 1964 he resoundedly defeated his rival Barry Goldwater.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-348  By now, Johnson's advisors feared that South Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-349  ...could be on the brink of collapse.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-350  From January 1st 1965 through to February 7th 1965,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-351  ...the Vietcong mounted a series of coordinated attacks across the country.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-352  They took and held the village of Binh Gia only 40 miles from Saigon,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-353  ...severely mauling government army units sent to the rescue.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-354  Altogether 200 government troops were killed near Binh Gia...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-355  ...along with 5 American advisors.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-356  The Battle culminated in a devastating ambush that almost wiped out...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-357  ...a relief column of elite South Vietnamese army rangers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-358  In Washington the pressure to do something...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-359  ...to save South Vietnam was now intense.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-360  Although Johnson doubted that bombing North Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-361  ...could dissuade it from supporting the Vietcong guerrillas,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-362  ...he agreed to let military planners prepare a major campaign.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-363  Meanwhile a series of strikes would be launched as reprisals...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-364  ...if there was any major attack by the Vietcong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-365  The provocation came on February 7th 1965.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-366  A US helicopter base and advisory compound in the central  highlands...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-367  ...of South Vietnam was attacked by NLF commandos.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-368  Nine Americans were killed and more than 76 were wounded.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-369  Johnson ordered immediate retaliation and U.S. navy fighter-bombers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-370  ...were launched to attack military targets just inside North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-371  Only three days after the U.S. raids there was another attack...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-372  ...by the Vietcong on Americans.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-373  This time it was a bomb in a hotel at Qui Nhon...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-374  ...which killed 23 U.S. servicemen.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-375  More retaliation strikes were launched and on February 13th 1965...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-376  President Johnson authorized a bigger campaign codenamed Operation Rolling Thunder.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-377  Rolling Thunder was to be a limited but long lasting offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-378  Its aim was to force North Vietnam to stop supporting the guerrillas in the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-379  THE MARINES  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-380  As Operation Rolling Thunder got underway...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-381  ...the chief of U.S. Military Assistance Command in Saigon,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-382  General William C. Westmoreland, grew increasingly worried about the security...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-383  ...of bases involved in the campaign.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-384  Da Nang, sited in a largely hostile area and guarded by a small Vietnamese army unit,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-385  ...was particularly vulnerable to Vietcong attack.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-386  Westmoreland asked for two battalions of U.S. marines,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-387  3,500 men, to be deployed around the base.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-388  On march 8th 1965, a battalion of the 9th Marine Expeditionary Brigade...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-389  ...went ashore at Da Nang.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-390  The second battalion would arrive later by air.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-391  The marines' mission was to be strictly confined...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-392  ...to defending the Da Nang base.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-393  However even as the troops were landing General Harold K. Johnson,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-394  the Army chief of staff, was already in Saigon...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-395  ...to talk about much bigger deployments.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-396  Gen. Johnson had been appointed by the president his special representative.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-397  His mission was to prompt General Westmoreland and the U.S. ambassador Maxwell Taylor...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-398  ...to say what troops they needed to win the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-399  In fact, Gen. Johnson and his fellow commanders at the Joint Chiefs of Staff...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-400  ...already had a clear idea of the forces they wanted for Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-401  The Joint Chiefs' wish was for three divisions, around 70,000 men.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-402  That was the number called for in their defense plan for Southeast Asia,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-403  ...Operation Plan 32.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-404  The plan had been designed to meet an invasion of South Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-405  ...from the North or China, something that no one now expected to happen.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-406  However, as part of the plan airfields, communications,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-407  ...and other facilities had already been put in place.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-408  Now, large numbers of troops could be deployed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-409  ...as soon as the president gave the order.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-410  VC OFFENSIVE  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-411  It was American public opinion that most worried president Johnson.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-412  He was determined to move slowly in sending more men to Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-413  He agreed to another 3,000 marines and 20,000 logistics and support troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-414  ...to prepare for further deployments,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-415  ... but for the moment that was as far as he would go.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-416  On April 7th 1965, at Johns Hopkins University...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-417  President Johnson offered economic aid to North Vietnam in exchange for peace.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-418  His offer was brusquely rejected by the North Vietnamese government.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-419  Two weeks later Johnson agreed to raise U.S. combat strength in Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-420  ...to more than 60,000 troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-421  Allied forces from Korea and Australia...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-422  ...would be added as a sign of international support.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-423  There were restrictions on how the U.S. commander in Vietnam,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-424  ...General Westmoreland, would be able to use the troops he had been given.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-425  They were to operate only inside clearly defined enclaves around their bases.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-426  To Westmoreland's dismay, all operations were to be strictly defensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-427  The American policy of defending enclaves...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-428  ...would soon be severely tested by the Vietcong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-429  The guerrillas were planning to unleash a massive offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-430  The campaign was designed to inflict the final blows...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-431  ...on the tattering South Vietnamese state.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-432  The storm broke on May 11th with a full scale assault...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-433  ...by 2,500 Vietcong troops on Song Be, a provincial capital.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-434  After fierce battles in and around the town the Vietcong withdrew...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-435  ...but only after holding Song Be for nearly two days.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-436  The Vietcong assault on Song Be was followed by a series of attacks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-437  ...to within a few miles of Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-438  Meanwhile, in the Central Highlands U.S. intelligence had detected...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-439  ...all the elements of the North Vietnamese Army's 325th division...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-440  ...and signs that the 304th was on its way.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-441  There was intense Vietcong activity in all the central provinces,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-442  ...with a big Vietcong victory near Ba Gia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-443  On June 10th 1965 at Dong Xuai a South Vietnamese district headquarters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-444  ...and US Special forces camp was overrun by a full regiment.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-445  It was abandoned only afte frantic American air attacks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-446  The sheer scale of the Vietcong's new offensive had far surpassed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-447  ...anything that either the South Vietnamese Army or the Americans had anticipated.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-448  The government's best and most mobile battalions had been shattered.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-449  The disaster was followed by political upheaval.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-450  A faction of young military officers installed air vice Marshall Ky...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-451  ...as the prime minister and General Nguyen Van Thieu as president,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-452  ...openly restoring military government.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-453  After the Vietcong's may offensive it was plain to the Americans...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-454  ...that enemy numbers were much higher than they had thought.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-455  That meant much more U.S. troops would be needed to hold the line.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-456  Estimates of just how many kept rising until on June 7th 1965...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-457  ...General Westmoreland asked Washington for 200,000 men.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-458  While Westmoreland was waiting for the president's decision,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-459  ...he was given new powers to use the troops he already had, more aggressively.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-460  He would no longer have to confine his men to defensive enclaves,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-461  ...but could go out and attack the enemy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-462  On June 27th 1965, General Westmoreland launched...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-463  ...the first purely offensive operation by American ground forces in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-464  It was a sweep into NLF territory just Northwest of Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-465  A month after the start of offensive operations,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-466  President Johnson announced that more troops would be sent to Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-467  He was still playing down the scale of the commitment...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-468  ...but he had already decided to deploy the 200,000 men he'd been asked for.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-469  The following day, the first troops of the big buildup arrived in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-470  The men were a battalion of the 101st airborne division.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-471  By this time there was no longer any doubt about just what their mission would be.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-472  They were to find the main Vietcong's main force military units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-473  ...and destroy them on the battlefield.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-474  OPERATION STARLITE  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-475  As the buildup of American forces in Vietnam went on...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-476  ...the chances they would be attacked grew by the day.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-477  On August 5th NLF sappers penetrated an oil storage depot near Da Nang...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-478  ...and blew up 2 million gallons of fuel.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-479  There had been sniping and mortar attacks too but the real fear was...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-480  ...of  a large scale infantry assault overrunning an American installation.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-481  What the Americans needed was accurate and timely intelligence...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-482  ...about what the enemy intended to do.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-483  It came when a deserter from the 1st Vietcong regiment,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-484  ...a force nearly 2,000 strong told his captors that his unit...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-485  ...was planning to hit the Marine base at Chu Lai.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-486  The marines quickly planned a full scale operation...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-487  ...to trap the Vietcong regiment in its assembly area.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-488  The operation was planned in the strictest secrecy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-489  Codenamed Operation Starlite and deploying 4,000 troops,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-490  ...it would be the first American regimental sized battle since the war in Korea.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-491  The marine base at Chu Lai was 15 miles from the village complex of Van Tuong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-492  Between the Tra Bong river the elevation known as Hill 43,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-493  ...and the Phouc Thuan peninsula there was a fortified Vietcong base area.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-494  There the 1st Vietcong regiment, made up of the 60th and 80th battalions,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-495  ...had assembled for the attack on Chu Lai.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-496  On August 17th 1965, company M of the 3rd battalion 3rd Marines...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-497  ...took up a blocking position on the Tra Bong river.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-498  Next morning, the rest of the battalion made an amphibious landing...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-499  ...while three more companies were inserted...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-500  ...at landing zones Red, White and Blue.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-501  The marines pushed on from LZs Red and White...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-502  ...but around hill 43, near LZ blue the entire Vietcong's 60th battalion...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-503  ...was dug in and there was a fierce battle before the hill was taken.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-504  There was also heavy Vietcong resistance...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-505  ...near the hamlet Americans called An Cuong 2.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-506  But after reinforcement, the Marines succeeded in squeezing the Vietcong...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-507  ...from three sides, trapping them with their backs to the sea.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-508  In operation Starlite it was the early battles that proved the heaviest.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-509  The first two companies in action took almost 1/3 casualties.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-510  29 were dead and many wounded.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-511  But the marines had claimed nearly 300 Vietcong killed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-512  The next 5 days involved only small scale actions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-513  As the marines advanced, the Vietcong numbed by the shattering naval artillery...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-514  ...and air bombardments fought delaying actions as they tried to disengage.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-515  In support of the attacking infantry...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-516  ...Marine guns of the Chu Lai base alone, fired over 3,000 rounds.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-517  The ships fired another 1,500.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-518  Marine air support was so effective that at times...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-519  ...aircraft were dropping their bombs within 200 feet of their own troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-520  At the end of the operation nearly 700 Vietcong were claimed as dead.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-521  The marines had lost 45 dead and more than 200 wounded in the battle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-522  AFTERMATH  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-523  For the United States marines, Operation Starlite...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-524  ...had been a resounding victory.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-525  In the first major battle of the war the guerrillas had been defeated...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-526  ...on their own territory and by inexperienced troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-527  The classic U.S. military doctrine...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-528  ...had worked exactly as it was supposed to.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-529  The enemy had been found, fixed in position...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-530  ...and then destroyed with massive firepower.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-531  The Marines moved fast to take advantage of their victory in Operation Starlite.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-532  They launched a series of attacks against NLF concentrations along the coast.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-533  Meanwhile, General Westmoreland's attention shifted to the central highlands.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-534  There, the threat was posed not by the Vietcong guerrillas...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-535  ...but by the newly arrived troops of the North Vietnamese Army.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-536  It was against these professional and highly trained regiments...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN02-537  ...that the Americans would fight their next major battle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-1  BATTLEFIELD VIETNAM  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-2  Search And Destroy  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-3  In 1967, American forces in South Vietnam launched a series of powerful attacks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-4  ...on the Vietnamese communist guerrillas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-5  The aim was to take the war to the NLF's biggest units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-6  ...by attacking their bases in overwhelming strength.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-7  The Americans hoped that the guerrillas would stand and fight.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-8  They could then annihilate them with vastly superior firepower.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-9  The offensives were designed to use the tactics...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-10  ...of Search and Destroy on the grandest scale yet.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-11  Some of the biggest helicopter operations of the war were mounted...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-12  ...to try and trap entire Vietcong regiments.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-13  More guns and aircraft were called in to support the attacks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-14  ...than had ever been unleashed on a Vietnam battlefield.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-15  The Americans meant to damage the Vietcong so badly...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-16  ...they would be unable to carry on the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-17  In fact, the Americans would fail to wipe out the Vietcong's biggest units.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-18  Despite heavy losses in men and equipment, the guerrillas would return...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-19  ...even stronger, ready to launch their own offensive campaign.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-20  PRELUDE TO THE BATTLE  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-21  By mid 1965, the mission of American troops in South Vietnam was changing fast.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-22  They had come to secure airbases, but now...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-23  ...they were actively looking for combat with the Vietcong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-24  On May 18th 1965 the 173rd airborne brigade...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-25  ...the first U.S. Army infantry unit to arrive in Vietnam, began operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-26  Its first task was to sweep a wide area around its base near Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-27  The 173rd met no real resistance.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-28  There were thousands of Vietcong troops in the Saigon area...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-29  ...but they remained elusive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-30  More American troops arrived.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-31  As the weeks went on, questions were asked about the whole policy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-32  Was it wise to send a conventional army...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-33  ...with its slow moving, heavily armed infantry, its planes, its tanks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-34  ...against guerrilla units that might be impossible to pin down?  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-35  The US commander in Vietnam General William C. Westmoreland,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-36  ...insisted that the army could find and beat the enemy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-37  There were soon encouraging signs.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-38  In August 1965, in Operation Starlite U.S. marines surrounded...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-39  ...a Vietcong regiment of 2,000 men and defeated them in a full scale battle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-40  The next major challenge was posed by the NLF's allies,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-41  ...the professional troops of the North Vietnamese Army.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-42  By September 1965, two North Vietnamese Army regiments,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-43  ...the 32nd and the 33rd, had moved down the Ho Chi Minh trail...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-44  ...and infiltrated from Cambodia into South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-45  The 66th regiment was following close behind.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-46  The plan was to take the provincial capital Pleiku...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-47  ...and advance along highway 19 to the coast to Qui Nhon,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-48  ...splitting the South in two.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-49  The Americans were determined to block the NVA's attempt to reach Qui Nhon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-50  The idea was to place in the An Khe valley...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-51  ...the most mobile force they possessed the 1st Air Cavalry division.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-52  The Air Cavalry was the first formation anywhere in the world...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-53  ...designed around the helicopter.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-54  The division was 15,000 strong and had 480 machines...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-55  5 times the number of a normal infantry division.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-56  The whole idea had, until recently been an experiment...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-57  ...with an eye on any future war in Europe.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-58  No one really knew how it would work in a place like Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-59  Combat units of the 1st Cavalry began to arrive at An Khe...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-60  ...in mid September 1965.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-61  By October the division was fully operational.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-62  Its base, Camp Radcliff, had grown into an massive complex...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-63  of helicopter pads, supply dumps accommodation and maintenance facilities.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-64  For the officers and men of the Air Cavalry there was a good deal to prove...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-65  ...and they were determined to take the battle to the enemy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-66  For their part, North Vietnamese Army commanders...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-67  ...were just as keen for a fight as the Americans.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-68  Their 6,000 troops, already in the border area,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-69  ...meant to keep up the pressure on the South Vietnamese government forces,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-70  ...at the same time they aimed to find out how well U.S. troops would fight...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-71  ...and how their own soldiers would cope with American weapons and tactics.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-72  After infiltrating into the South the 32nd and the 33rd North Vietnamese regiments...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-73  ...had established a base area on the high ground of the Chu Pong massif.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-74  On October 20th 1965 the 33rd regiment...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-75  ...laid siege to an American Special Forces camp at Plei Me.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-76  After a Siege that lasted six days the South Vietnamese Army,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-77  ...backed by the US Air Cavalry secured that camp,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-78  ...and both NVA regiments withdrew to the Chu Pong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-79  There they meant to join with the newly arrived 66th regiment...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-80  ...before renewing their campaign.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-81  The American plan was to fly in the whole of the 1st battalion...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-82  ...of the 7th Cavalry to find the NVA regiments.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-83  It was the first time US troops would face NVA regulars.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-84  The first step was to create an artillery fire support base...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-85  ...near the Chu Pong at Landing Zone Falcon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-86  Next the lead elements of the 1st battalion landed at LZ X-ray.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-87  Right in front of them were nearly all the 66th and 33rd  NVA regiments.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-88  When company B pushed towards the spear of the Chu Pong...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-89  ...it was attacked immediately and the platoon was encircled.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-90  Company A was also pinned down by fierce fire...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-91  ...before the rest of the first battalion was landed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-92  A and B companies then launched attacks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-93  ...to relieve the encircled platoon but were driven back.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-94  The following morning, the Americans reinforced by another company,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-95  ...were hit by waves of NVA troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-96  Heavy fire support wreaked havoc on the attackers and by now,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-97  ...another American battalion was on its way overland.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-98  Conceding defeat, the shattered North Vietnamese regiments began to pull back...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-99  ...towards the Ia Drang valley and the safety of Cambodia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-100  After the fight at LZ X-Ray the Chu Pong was bombed by almost a hundred B-52s  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-101  ...each unloading 17 tons of high explosives.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-102  For the next 10 days the NVA regiments were pursued relentlessly by the Americans.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-103  But although the North Vietnamese were in retreat...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-104  ...they were still capable of hitting back.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-105  In one textbook ambush mounted by a rear guard battalion of the 66th regiment...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-106  ...155 Americans were killed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-107  For U.S. forces it was the most costly day of the war so far.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-108  In the battle of the Ia Drang valley in the Pleiku operation...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-109  ...the 1st Air Cavalry division lost 300 dead but the NVA had suffered much worse.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-110  1,300 North Vietnamese soldiers had been killed and many more wounded.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-111  It was a clear-cut victory for the Americans.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-112  Two enemy regiments were all but smashed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-113  ...and there was now little danger of South Vietnam being cut in two.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-114  The Ia Drang battle was a major boost for U.S. commanders.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-115  It seemed to prove their strategy was the right one.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-116  The enemy's big units could be made to stand and fight...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-117  ...and take heavy casualties in the process.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-118  If the communists could be forced into more battles like Ia Drang,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-119  ...they would quickly suffer such losses they would have to abandon their whole campaign.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-120  THE LEADERS – United States  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-121  The final push to use American combat forces in South Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-122  ...had come from President Lyndon Johnson himself.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-123  Yet he had never wanted to fight a war in Asia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-124  Johnson's priority was social reform his Great Society program,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-125  ...and he feared the war in Vietnam might fatally damage his plans.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-126  The problem for Johnson was that if the war grew unpopular,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-127  ...it could cost him the political support his program needed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-128  On the other hand, if Vietnam was lost to communism...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-129  ...it would be just as damaging.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-130  The only solution that Johnson could see,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-131  ...and the one agreed with his defense secretary Robert McNamara,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-132  ...was an uneasy compromise.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-133  The US would carry on fighting the war but everything possible would be done...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-134  ...to limit its impact on the American people.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-135  Dramatic measures like calling up the reserves, or the National Guard...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-136  ...had to be avoided.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-137  Above all, Johnson was determined to keep China and the Soviet Union...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-138  ...out of the conflict in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-139  By now both communist powers had nuclear weapons...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-140  ...and China had almost unlimited manpower.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-141  Fighting the Chinese in Asia would demand millions of American troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-142  ...and cost untold casualties.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-143  Johnson's solution was to fight a limited war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-144  He restricted the bombing campaign against North Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-145  ...to personally approved targets.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-146  He also ruled out invading the North no matter how much it backed the NLF.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-147  In fact, General Westmoreland, the US commander in South Vietnam,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-148  ...had no desire yet to go into what he felt were communist sanctuaries...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-149  ...in neighboring countries.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-150  But what he did want was a much more effective bombing campaign...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-151  ...to cut the flow of supplies and men to the guerrillas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-152  If that happened, Westmoreland was confident he could win.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-153  He would need more troops but once he had built up his forces,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-154  ...he was sure he could seize the initiative.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-155  THE LEADERS – The Vietcong  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-156  The leaders of the National Liberation Front were rarely able to meet.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-157  They were force to gather in the strictest secrecy...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-158  ...in a remote forest area near the Cambodian border.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-159  The fear was that a single American bombing raid...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-160  ...could wipe out the leadership at a stroke.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-161  Security was intense and avoiding enemy units meant...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-162  ...that some members had to travel for weeks to reach the conference.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-163  The Central Committee had 52 members and was led by the Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-164  Tho was a French educated lawyer and to many in South Vietnam,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-165  ...the acceptable moderate face of the Vietcong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-166  But behind Tho were lifelong communists like the General Secretary Huyn Tan Phat.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-167  ...an architect and the NLF's foremost thinker.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-168  Another hard liner was the French educated lawyer Tran Bu Kim...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-169  ...one of the NLF's founders.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-170  By now, Northerners were in almost full control of the military command...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-171  ...and through them North Vietnam was making sure its policies were followed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-172  The NLF guerrilla army was even more closely controlled by the North.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-173  Its top commander was the North Vietnamese Army general Nguyen Chi Thanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-174  Thanh was noted as a political firebrand...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-175  ...and wanted to stay on the offensive whatever the cost or the dangers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-176  Thanh was equal in rank to the North Vietnamese defense minister General Giap...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-177  ...who favored a more cautious approach in the South,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-178  ...now that American firepower had entered the equation.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-179  By the end of 1965, Giap was winning the argument.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-180  The result would soon be felt on the battlefields of South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-181  STRATEGY – United States  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-182  When American combat troops had first arrived in Vietnam,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-183  ...few U.S. officials had believed that the South could survive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-184  By the end of 1965, the picture had changed dramatically.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-185  The new government led by Air Marshall Ky was growing in confidence.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-186  The arrival of American troops had given morale a huge boost...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-187  ...and there was no longer a danger that the communists could win quickly.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-188  For General Westmoreland, the next stage was...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-189  ...to go on the offensive against the Vietcong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-190  His aim was to take on the big formations on the battlefield...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-191  ...and eliminate them one by one.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-192  The tactics would be those of Search and Destroy, finding and trapping the enemy,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-193  ...then smashing his forces with massive firepower.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-194  General Westmoreland's strategy would be...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-195  ...to wear the Vietcong down by relentless attrition.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-196  In battle after battle Westmoreland meant to force the Vietcong...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-197  ...to sacrifice troops and materials faster than they could ever be replaced.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-198  The measure of success would be the amount of supplies destroyed,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-199  ...the number of bases knocked out and above all the body count,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-200  ...the number of enemy soldiers actually killed in battle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-201  For defense, 4 national priority areas were agreed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-202  ...by the Americans and the South Vietnamese.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-203  The coastal provinces around Da Nang and Qui Nhon,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-204  ...and the central part of the Mekong Delta,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-205  ...and above all, Saigon,  the capital.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-206  These were to be first consolidated and then made springboards...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-207  ...for large Search and Destroy operations against enemy units in base areas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-208  The greatest Vietcong concentrations in the whole of South Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-209  ...were known to lay between the capital and the Cambodian border.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-210  Through this area ran several strategic roads...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-211  ...and the river routes into the capital.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-212  There were believed to be enemy bases in the Iron Triangle,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-213  ...War Zone C and War Zone D.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-214  These base areas were the destination for most of the supplies and men...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-215  ...that came down the Ho Chi Minh trail  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-216  and it was these bases that the Americans would have to attack...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-217  ...if the Vietcong were to be finally defeated.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-218  A key part of the American strategy was to stop the Vietcong...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-219  ...replacing the men and supplies they lost in battle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-220  The “Commando Hunt” bombing campaign...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-221  ...was hitting the North Vietnamese transport system and the staging areas...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-222  ...for troops infiltrating down to the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-223  During 1965 U.S. aircraft had flown...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-224  55,000 individual sorties over the North.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-225  In the South itself the Americans meant to take over most of the fighting.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-226  The U.S. forces were better armed and trained...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-227  ...than South Vietnamese government troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-228  They were much more mobile and had the backing of enormous firepower.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-229  Meanwhile, to the intense frustration of many South Vietnamese army commanders,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-230  ...government forces would deal mainly with local security.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-231  Only elite units would take part in offensive operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-232  STRATEGY – The Vietcong  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-233  In December 1965 Ho Chi Minh and the North Vietnamese leadership...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-234  ordered a change in the way the war in the South was to be fought.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-235  From now on, the Vietcong would avoid pitch battles with the Americans...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-236  ...unless the odds were clearly on their favor.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-237  There would be more hit and run attacks and ambushes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-238  To counter the American buildup Vietcong recruitment would be stepped up,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-239  ...and more North Vietnamese army troops would be infiltrated into South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-240  The Vietnamese communists, following the example of Chinese guerrillas before them,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-241  ...had always given the highest priority to creating safe base areas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-242  They were training grounds logistics centers and headquarters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-243  They also offered secure sanctuaries for times when the war might go badly.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-244  Hiding the base areas had always been a high priority for the Vietcong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-245  Now, with American spotter planes everywhere...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-246  it was more vital than ever to protect them.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-247  In remote swaps or forests there were few problems,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-248  ...but nearer the capital it was much more difficult.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-249  The answer was to build enormous swarms of underground tunnels.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-250  The biggest were in the Iron Triangle and in the Cu Chi district...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-251  ...only 20 miles from Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-252  In the Cu Chi base area, any facility used by the guerrillas...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-253  ...like a conference room or training area had almost instant access...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-254  ...to the safety of underground.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-255  Hidden trap doors led below past guarded chambers to long passages.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-256  At regular intervals, branches led back to the surface and other secret entrances.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-257  Some openings were even concealed beneath the waters of streams or canals.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-258  At the deeper levels there were chambers carved out for arms factories  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-259  and a well for the base's water supply.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-260  There were storerooms for weapons and rice  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-261  and there was sometimes a hospital or forward aid station.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-262  Long communication tunnels connected the base with other distant complexes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-263  Base kitchens were always near the surface, with long carved out chimneys...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-264  ...designed to diffuse cooking smoke and release it some distance away.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-265  Near the kitchens, where the guerrillas' sleeping chambers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-266  ...where they could survive for weeks at a time if need be.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-267  Everywhere at the top level there were tunnels leading back upwards...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-268  ...to hundreds of hidden firing posts for the defense of the base.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-269  The Base Area at Cu Chi was a vast network with 200 miles of tunnels.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-270  There were other complexes too, big and small  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-271  ...scattered all over the country.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-272  Each villager in an NLF area had to dig a meter of tunnel a day.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-273  There was even a standard handbook specifying...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-274  ...exactly how tunnels were to be built.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-275  The orders coming from NLF headquarters were absolutely clear:  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-276  Tunnels were not to be treated as mere shelters, they were to be fighting bases,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-277  ...able to provide continuous support for troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-278  Even if the village was in enemy hands, the NLF beneath...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-279  ...should still be fully capable of offensive operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-280  THE OPPOSING FORCES – United States  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-281  When Washington had decided to send American troops to fight the Vietcong,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-282  the biggest question had been “How many would be needed to win?”  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-283  Military planners accepted that to win a war against guerrillas,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-284  ...an army needed to outnumber them 10 or even 15 to 1.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-285  But American Generals were now arguing that the Vietcong...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-286  ...was no longer a guerrilla force...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-287  ...but a conventional army of big units.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-288  Because U.S. commanders were confident they were not fighting a guerrilla war,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-289  ...they saw no need for a 10 to 1 superiority in forces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-290  Against a regular army, 3 to 1 was usually considered enough.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-291  400,000 US troops plus the South Vietnamese Army...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-292  would be just sufficient to reach that target.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-293  The plan was to have most of the men in Vietnam by the end of 1966.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-294  The South Vietnamese Army had divided the country...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-295  ...into 4 tactical zones with an army corp in each.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-296  As American forces arrived, Military Assistance Command Headquarters in Saigon...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-297  ...assigned them to a corp's tactical zone.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-298  By the end of 1965, the 3rd Marine Amphibious Force...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-299  ...commanded 4 regiments in I Corp.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-300  The 1st Air Cavalry division was in II corp,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-301  ...along with a brigade of the 101st airborne.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-302  The 1st infantry division and the 173rd airborne were in III Corp.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-303  During 1966 the plan was to build up U.S. strength by 2 Marine regiments,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-304  ...three army divisions an armored cavalry regiment,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-305  ...and two light infantry brigades.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-306  The combat strength of allied nations were also increased...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-307  ...to two Korean divisions and a Marine brigade, an Australian Task Force,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-308  ... plus New Zealand and Philippine units.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-309  By late December 1965, almost 150,000 U.S. troops had arrived in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-310  The Air Force had over 500 aircraft at 8 bases.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-311  The huge scale of the buildup had placed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-312  ...an incredible strain on facilities and installations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-313  There was a frenzy of building as Army and Navy engineers,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-314  ...along with American civilian contractors improved airfields, bases and roads.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-315  The most ambitious construction project of all...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-316  ...was a gigantic port and logistics base at Cameron Bay.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-317  The whole effort was to cost 100 million dollars.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-318  But the new facility would quickly ease the pressure...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-319  ...on Saigon's overloaded docks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-320  By now American supplies arriving in Vietnam by sea...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-321  ...were topping 300,000 tons a month and rising fast.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-322  THE TROOPS – United States  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-323  As the cold war had produced one world crisis after another...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-324  ...the US armed forces had been on a war footing almost continuously for 5 years.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-325  Budgets were generous, and all the services were superbly well equipped and trained.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-326  Many American officers and NCO's...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-327  ...already had combat experience in Vietnam as military advisors.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-328  Most of the more senior personnel had fought in WWII or Korea.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-329  But for the enlisted men many of whom were draftees...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-330  ...their training programs rarely prepared them for what was to come.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-331  Even to the best trained soldiers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-332  ...the reality of arriving in Vietnam could come as a shock.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-333  The climate was exhausting with extremes of heat and humidity.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-334  The Vietnamese people and their culture were totally unfamiliar.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-335  Many American soldiers were from U.S. cities...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-336  ...and the lives of Southeast Asian peasants were beyond anything they knew.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-337  But in spite of the strangeness of the world in which they had come to fight  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-338  ...at this stage morale was high amongst American troops in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-339  There was confidence in the army's leadership...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-340  ...and most units had a strong sense of camaraderie.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-341  There was also the knowledge that a soldier's basic tour of duty...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-342  ...was a finite 13 months and 14 days.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-343  While thousands of Americans were getting their first look at Vietnam,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-344  ...the South Vietnamese army was in its sixth year of war...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-345  ...and most of the army's 300,000 soldiers were reluctant conscripts.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-346  Many were underfed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-347  ...and desertions were outstripping recruitment by 2,000 a month.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-348  As for the officers, corruption was rife...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-349  ...many sold their units' food and supplies.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-350  The most senior commanders had nearly all been appointed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-351  ...for their political and family connections.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-352  WEAPONS – United States  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-353  For years, the basic infantry weapon of the American soldier...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-354  ...had been the M-14 rifle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-355  It was a dependable weapon, but was unstable when fired on full automatic.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-356  The M-14 would stay in service with some units for a long time yet...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-357  but a new weapon was starting to reach the troops in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-358  The M-16 was a light, compact assault rifle made of metal alloy and plastic.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-359  It was effective up to 400 yards and had very high rate of fire.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-360  Although on paper the M-16 seemed to offer the infantryman...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-361  ...everything he could wish for in a rifle,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-362  ...the reality was very different on the battlefield.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-363  The M-16 was prone to jamming a nightmare for the soldier in a firefight.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-364  The problem was reduced by scrupulous cleaning,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-365  ...and later modifications would cure the problem completely.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-366  But in the meantime, many men viewed the M-16 with deep mistrust.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-367  In an American infantry platoon the most valued weapon of all...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-368  ...was the M-60 machine gun.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-369  The M-60 could fire more than a 100 rounds a minute...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-370  ...and had a range of 1,000 yards.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-371  The gun was usually operated by a two man crew,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-372  ...but it could also be fired from the hip.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-373  The M-60 was extremely robust and well suited...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-374  ...to the harsh conditions of battle in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-375  As well as the weapons they took with them into the field,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-376  ...American infantry could call on heavy fire support at any time.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-377  Ground attack aircraft could saturate the area with high explosives or napalm  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-378  while few operations were ever mounted out of range of friendly artillery.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-379  Unlike aircraft, guns were not affected by  weather or visibility...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-380  ...and they were extremely accurate.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-381  The biggest American artillery pieces the 175mm Howitzers,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-382  ...could destroy a target at a range of 20 miles.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-383  By now every infantry division depended heavily on helicopters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-384  ... to maneuver its forces on the battlefield...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-385  ...and to carry supplies and heavy equipment.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-386  For the Army the basic infantry transport helicopter was the UH-1 Huey.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-387  The men called it 'Slick'...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-388  ...because its frame was uncluttered by guns or rockets.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-389  The Huey was able to carry 11 soldiers and their equipment.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-390  For protection, each helicopter had a door gunner with an M-60.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-391  As well as Hueys for transporting infantry and general supplies...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-392  there were Huey gunships for escort and assault.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-393  The gunships were armed with a formidable array of rockets,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-394  ...machine guns and grenade launchers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-395  THE OPPOSING FORCES – The Vietcong  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-396  By the end of 1965 the total strength of the NLF...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-397  ...and North Vietnamese Army units in the South...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-398  ...had grown into 206,000 men and women.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-399  Of these, 36,000 were main force NVA troops,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-400  ...the rest were regional and local guerrillas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-401  The main force Vietcong units were used to launch large scale offensives...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-402  ...over a wide area.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-403  They were uniformed, full time soldiers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-404  Regional forces were also full time,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-405  ...but they were operated inside their own districts.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-406  If necessary, their units could come together...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-407  ...to make bigger formations for a large scale attack.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-408  If enemy pressure became too great,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-409  ...they could break again down into smaller units and scatter.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-410  As for the local guerrillas based in the villages, their main job was political.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-411  ...they were a constant remainder of the armed presence of the Vietcong...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-412  ...and worked to increase local support.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-413  They were also expected to defend nearby installations,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-414  ...like bunkers and tunnel complexes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-415  Vietcong forces were commanded by the Central Office for South Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-416  ...near the Cambodian border.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-417  The NLF deployed two divisions the 9th, with 3 regiments,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-418  ...and the 5th with two.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-419  Four more regiments were independent main force units.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-420  The NLF also controlled more than 40 local and regional battalions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-421  Further North, all communist operations were run by the North Vietnamese Army.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-422  The NVA deployed 3 divisions and 9 independent regiments.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-423  In 1965 American aircraft made tens of thousands of bombing attacks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-424  ...against the Ho Chi Minh supply trail...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-425  ...and on logistics centers in North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-426  In spite of their efforts, the Vietcong were getting more weapons...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-427  ...and reinforcements from the North than ever before.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-428  The average Vietcong unit was now better armed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-429  ...than at any time in the movement's history.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-430  Although the guerrillas depended on the Ho Chi Minh trail for arms, ammunition...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-431  ...and special equipment, 21 tons a day was enough to keep them fighting.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-432  Their other needs were met inside South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-433  To feed the troops, rice taxes were imposed on farmers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-434  ...and every possible local resource was used and reused, nothing was wasted.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-435  Even the American supplies and containers left behind on the battlefield...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-436  ...were put to some military purpose.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-437  THE TROOPS – The Vietcong  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-438  In the last 12 months the Vietcong had suffered terrible losses.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-439  40,000 had been killed or captured in 1965.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-440  Yet the casualties had little effect on Vietcong fighting strength.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-441  Losses in the main force units were easily made up...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-442  ...from the ranks of the local guerrillas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-443  The biggest problem was the high casualty rate among officers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-444  To replace these the Vietcong depended on trained men...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-445  ...coming down the Ho Chi Minh trail from the North.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-446  One in ten Vietcong were now Northern...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-447  ...and the Vietcong was increasingly run by the Northerners right down to the village level.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-448  By this time most Vietcong main force soldiers had fought for years...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-449  ...and were highly skilled and motivated.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-450  Every attack was planned down to the last detail...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-451  ...using elaborate models and endless rehearsals.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-452  The troops were well trained in infantry tactics and night operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-453  They were also masters of camouflage.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-454  While main force troops thought of themselves as professional soldiers  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-455  ...local Vietcong were far less confident.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-456  Mostly, the recruits were young teenagers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-457  and while many were motivated by idealism,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-458  ...others had been pressured or shamed into joining.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-459  What many had in common were real doubts about their ability...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-460  ...to fight heavily armed and well trained American soldiers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-461  WEAPONS – The Vietcong  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-462  Most main force Vietcong troops were now armed with a superb assault rifle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-463  The AK-47 was a Russian design copied by the Chinese.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-464  It was comparable to the American M-16 but it had fewer moving parts.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-465  The stock was wood, not plastic and was far more reliable...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-466  ...in Vietnam's testing conditions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-467  The AK-47 also had the advantage of a 30 round magazine,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-468  ...compared to the 20 of the American rifle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-469  The Vietcong had a range of effective Soviet and Chinese...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-470  ...light and medium machine guns.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-471  They also had heavy machine guns though never enough.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-472  The bigger weapons were especially valued...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-473  ...for defense against American helicopters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-474  For destroying armored vehicles or bunkers, the Vietcong had...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-475  ...highly effective rocket-propelled grenades and recoilless rifles.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-476  Mortars were also available in large numbers,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-477  ...and had the advantage of being very easy to transport.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-478  Many weapons, including booby traps and mines were homemade in the villages.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-479  The materials ranged from scavenged tin cans to discarded wire  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-480  ...but the most important ingredients were provided by the enemy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-481  In a year, dud American bombs could leave more than 20,000 tons of explosive...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-482  ...scattered around the Vietnamese countryside.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-483  After air raids, volunteers retrieved the duds...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-484  ...and the dangerous business of creating a new weapon began.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-485  In 1966 locally made devices would kill more than 1,000 American soldiers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-486  EVE OF BATTLE  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-487  For General Westmoreland the close of 1965 marked the end...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-488  ...of the defensive stage of the American war in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-489  In the coming year he meant to complete his buildup  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-490  then, he would launch the full scale offensives that would lead to final victory.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-491  The key to Westmoreland's strategy was that communist main force units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-492  would be destroyed in set piece battles by concentrated American firepower.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-493  Westmoreland was confident the Vietcong would stand and fight.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-494  But there were some signs that the Vietcong might be changing their tactics.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-495  In the last weeks of 1965, the Vietcong concentrated their attacks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-496  ...on poorly defended targets like isolated outposts and remote towns.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-497  Strong South Vietnamese or American forces were making contact...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-498  ...with big guerrilla units less and less often.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-499  At the same time, there were more sniping incidents and ambushes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-500  As a result, while Vietcong's casualties went down...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-501  ...American and South Vietnamese army losses increased dramatically.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-502  There was even more disturbing news in store...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-503  ...for American commanders as 1965 came to a close.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-504  Washington's Defense Intelligence Agency reported...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-505  ...that the Rolling Thunder bombing campaign against North Vietnam was failing.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-506  After ten months of increasingly fierce air attacks, the North showed no signs...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-507  ...it was about to give up its support for the Vietcong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-508  Nor had the bombing staunched the flow of men and supplies to the guerrillas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-509  That meant only one thing:  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-510  The real contest was still to come...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN03-511  ...on the battlefields of South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-1  BATTLEFIELD VIETNAM  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-2  Showdown in the Iron Triangle  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-3  For the Americans in South Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-4  1966 was to be a year of dramatic expansion.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-5  U.S. forces were planned to double to just under 430,000 men.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-6  While the buildup was going on...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-7  ...the priority was to secure key parts of the country.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-8  By far the most important was the capital, Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-9  Saigon was a teeming city of 2 million people.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-10  It was the seat of the South Vietnamese government...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-11  and the location of South Vietnamese and American military headquarters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-12  Above all, Saigon was the symbol of the South's independence...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-13  ...from the communist North.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-14  For the commanders of the Vietcong guerrillas,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-15  ...the capital was the ultimate prize.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-16  The tens of thousands of Vietcong based within 50 miles of Saigon...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-17  ...were already drawing in noose tight around the city.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-18  Powerful guerrilla units were pushing...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-19  ...right up to Saigon doorstep.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-20  In the countryside around the city traditional Vietcong base areas...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-21  ...had all the facilities that combat forces needed to prepare their attacks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-22  Since American Infantry units had first arrived, they had been trying...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-23  ...to disrupt the guerrilla's activities around the capital.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-24  On January 8th 1966, they launched the most ambitious sweep yet.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-25  Operation Crimp deployed 8,000 troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-26  making it the biggest American operation of the war so far.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-27  Its aim was to capture the Vietcong's headquarters for the whole Saigon area.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-28  The Vietcong's headquarters for Saigon was believed to be...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-29  ...somewhere in the Cu Chi district the communist stronghold...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-30  ...barely 20 miles from the capital.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-31  The attack would be launched by the American 173rd airborne brigade...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-32  ...a battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-33  ...and a brigade of the 1st infantry division.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-34  North of Cu Chi town was the disused Fil Hol rubber plantation...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-35  ...and the forested area the Americans called the Ho Bo woods.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-36  Beneath the whole district ran the massive Cu Chi tunnel complex...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-37  ...about which the Americans still knew almost nothing.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-38  In the tunnels were the Vietcong's Cu Chi military headquarters,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-39  ...a signals intelligence unit, two hospitals,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-40  ...the Saigon political office...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-41  ...and the Saigon regional military headquarters,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-42  ...the one the Americans were looking for.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-43  As with every American search and destroy sweep, Operation Crimp began...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-44  ...with massive air strikes and artillery bombardments.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-45  NLF agents had long before warned that a big American operation was coming.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-46  Guerrilla commanders had already moved...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-47  ...several thousand troops out of the Cu Chi area.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-48  Only a thousand local guerrillas were left behind,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-49  ...mostly inexperienced teenagers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-50  But with the tunnels to fight from they were confident...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-51  ...they could inflict serious casualties to the Americans.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-52  Right from the start, as the Americans attacked into the Ho Bo woods,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-53  ...they faced rifle fire, grenades and booby traps.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-54  NLF snipers opened up from hidden firing positions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-55  ...and within seconds vanished back into their tunnels.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-56  The Americans hardly ever saw the enemy who was firing at them.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-57  As the days went on the Americans grew ever more frustrated and demoralized.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-58  Dozens of men were killed or injured.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-59  Every path seemed to lead to a trap.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-60  Only slowly did units began to discover trenches and bunkers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-61  They also found a handful of tunnel entrances.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-62  Still no one had any idea of the sheer scale...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-63  ...of the complex beneath their feet.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-64  Although the Cu Chi guerrillas had suffered casualties...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-65  ...they had achieved their main objective.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-66  The tunnel complex and headquarters had survived virtually intact...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-67  ...as had the whole Vietcong organization in the area.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-68  In late January 1966 only a few days after the end of Operation Crimp,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-69  ...troops of the 25th Infantry division arrived at Cu Chi.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-70  Their orders were to secure the area for the 25th's main base.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-71  The Americans succeeded in pushing out of perimeter...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-72  ...using every ounce of firepower they could muster.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-73  But from the first day they faced...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-74  ...constant harassing attacks from the Cu Chi guerrillas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-75  For months, the 25th Infantry Division was plagued...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-76  ...by mysterious gun and grenade incidents inside its camp.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-77  Slowly, to the horror of the Americans, it was discovered...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-78  ...they came from tunnels dug under the base itself.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-79  They were eventually found and sealed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-80  But the main tunnel complex only a few miles away,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-81  ...would keep its secrets for years to come.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-82  SPRING OFFENSIVE  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-83  In February 1966, the American 1st Infantry Division mounted...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-84  ...four big Search and Destroy operations just North of Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-85  The result was disappointing.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-86  There were clashes with units from two Vietcong regiments,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-87  ...but there were no major battles.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-88  What the First's commanders wanted was a set piece fight...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-89  ...with the most powerful and dangerous enemy force in the region,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-90  ...the 9th Vietcong Division.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-91  The 9th was made up of veteran regiments and was constantly on the move.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-92  The division was now poised to launch its spring offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-93  The communist leadership had ordered the Vietcong to avoid...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-94  ...head-on clashes with the Americans unless the odds were very favorable.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-95  But NLF leaders still meant to fight aggressively.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-96  General Thanh, the energetic commander of the NLF,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-97  ...strongly believed that the soldier was more important than his weapons.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-98  Thanh was certain that what the troops of the 9th lacked in hardware...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-99  ...they would make up for in revolutionary zeal.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-100  From the 9th's divisions bases in War Zone C, two regiments...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-101  ...headed into the Vietcong strongholds of the Iron Triangle and War zone D.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-102  At the same time, the 2nd brigade of the American 1st division...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-103  ...was pushing into War Zone C,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-104  ...and the 3rd brigade was moving into the Iron Triangle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-105  The first clash came on March 5th 1966,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-106  ...when the whole 272nd regiment attacked a battalion...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-107  ...of the 3rd brigade at Lo Ke.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-108  Intense U.S. air and artillery strikes drove off the attackers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-109  Two days later, the American 1st brigade...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-110  ...with a battalion of the 273rd Airborne, swept into Warzone D.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-111  An entire Vietcong Regiment attacked the Airborne's positions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-112  Again, devastating U.S. Artillery fire turned back the assault.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-113  In the March battles in the Iron Triangle and Warzone D,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-114  ...skillfully directed American fire power had averted disaster.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-115  Hundreds of Vietcong had been killed by artillery and air strikes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-116  However, to the intense frustration of U.S. commanders,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-117  ...after the fights, the Vietcong regiments had simply melted away.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-118  During the weeks that followed the Americans kept up the tempo...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-119  ...of Search and Destroy operations in front of Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-120  Commanders were determined to make contact with the enemy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-121  In late April, they launched a major operation into War Zone C...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-122  ...to try and find the Vietcong 9th division.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-123  Operation Birmingham lasted for three weeks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-124  More than 5,000 American troops of the 1st Infantry Division took part.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-125  They were backed by huge numbers of helicopters and armored vehicles.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-126  Although there were hundreds of vicious small scale actions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-127  ...fought by platoons and squads on both sides,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-128  ...the big battles the Americans hoped for, never did materialize.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-129  In three weeks only 100 Vietcong were killed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-130  Most disturbing of all for American commanders,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-131  ...most of the fighting that had happened had been started by the Vietcong...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-132  ...at the time and place they chose.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-133  TACTICS  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-134  From the start, the Vietnamese had followed the seven principles...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-135  ...of guerrilla warfare laid down by the Chinese leader Mao Tse Tung.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-136  To these, General Giap had added four more steps:  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-137  if the enemy advances, we retreat.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-138  If he holds, we harass.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-139  If he avoids battle, we attack.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-140  If he retreats, we follow.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-141  Almost every Search and Destroy operation that the Americans had launched...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-142  ...had been met with Giap's tactics.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-143  The places the Americans were most likely to land their helicopters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-144  ...were set up for ambushes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-145  Trails were quickly booby trapped and mined...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-146  ...and snipers left in place.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-147  If the Americans did stumble onto a big NLF unit the chances were...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-148  ...it was occupying prepared fortifications with tunnels, bunkers and trenches.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-149  It was when the Americans set up a defensive perimeter for the night...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-150  ...or created artillery fire bases, as they did during every operation...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-151  ...that the Vietcong would attack in strength.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-152  Always the guerrillas had a plan for breaking off the battle...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-153  ...if the opposition got too tough.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-154  At first, American tactics had been totally unsuited...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-155  ...to the long witted skilled guerrilla enemy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-156  With hard won experience that was changing.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-157  Commanders learned that helicopter landings had to be fast and aggressive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-158  Sergeants told their men not to bunch up but to stay spread out,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-159  ...otherwise a machine gun or a mortar round could kill several men at once.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-160  When camp was made, perimeter defenses had to be strong...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-161  .. with clear fields of fire all around.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-162  Above all, American soldiers learned they had to be vigilant at all times.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-163  ROUTE 13  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-164  By mid 1966 the U.S. commander General Westmoreland...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-165  ...was getting more and more impatient.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-166  His whole strategy depended on causing the enemy...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-167  ...to lose men and equipment faster than they could be replaced.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-168  For that, Westmoreland needed big battles.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-169  He ordered the 1st Division to make...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-170  ...more substantial contact with the Vietcong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-171  Most of the battles that did happen were started...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-172  ...not by the Americans, but by the NLF's 9th Division.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-173  Route 13, linking Saigon to the Cambodian border,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-174  ...was the site for major ambushes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-175  In some, the guerrilla struck with 1,000 troops at a time.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-176  In one attack after another on route 13,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-177  ...U.S. tanks and armored vehicles were destroyed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-178  On June 30th 1966, a major battle nearly ended...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-179  ...in complete disaster for the Americans.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-180  It was fiercely effective air and artillery support that saved the day.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-181  Soon after the battles the whole NLF 9th division...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-182  ...moved back into its most impenetrable base areas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-183  Some crossed over into Cambodia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-184  There, General Thanh meant to rebuild the division...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-185  ...for a new campaign in November the start of a new dry season.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-186  THE HIGHLANDS  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-187  In the past year, the strength of the North Vietnamese regular army...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-188  ...inside the South, had risen to upwards of 60,000 men.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-189  Of these 10,000 were concentrated in the remote central highlands.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-190  It was this area that General Giap the North Vietnamese Army commander...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-191  ...saw as a killing zone, a battlefield on which enormous casualties...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-192  ...could be inflicted on the enemy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-193  Giap believed that the forests and mountains of the central highlands...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-194  ...were specially well suited to big military operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-195  Whole regiments could be hidden and the Highlands weather...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-196  ...could be relied on to disrupt American air power.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-197  The troops would also be close to supplies and reinforcements...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-198  ...across the Cambodian border.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-199  As fighting units, the NVA were tough,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-200  ...well disciplined and well trained.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-201  For months they had been constantly on the offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-202  Their main target was the South Vietnamese Army.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-203  But isolated American Special Forces camps were also hit.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-204  Increasingly, attacks were carried out by units up to 2,000 strong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-205  The North Vietnamese Army units in the Central Highlands of Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-206  were part of a strategy meant to keep the Americans off-balance.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-207  There were powerful NVA divisions on the Demilitarized Zone...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-208  ...separating North and South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-209  And there were the NLF regiments opposite Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-210  Communist forces could present the Americans with a challenge...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-211  ...in any of the three areas and force them to react.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-212  By the middle of 1966, North Vietnamese units crossing the Demilitarized Zone...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-213  ...had successfully drawn the US marines North.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-214  In the highlands the NVA 24th regiment...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-215  ...had engaged elements of the 101st Airborne Division.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-216  The 1st NVA division had pulled a U.S. Infantry brigade...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-217  ...and the 1st Air Cavalry towards the Cambodian border.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-218  The Americans in the Central Highlands did succeed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-219  ...in inflicting thousands of casualties on the North Vietnamese Army.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-220  But in some of the most arduous fighting country in Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-221  ...the Americans found it impossible to trap large enemy units.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-222  Time after time they succeeded in slipping through the net.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-223  Although the American Military were killing 5 North Vietnamese soldiers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-224  ...for every one of their own losses,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-225  ...Northern commanders were still confident.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-226  General Giap was sure that his forces could stay on the offensive...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-227  ...and take heavy casualties as long as there were no dramatic defeats.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-228  The manpower potential of North Vietnam had barely been tapped.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-229  AREA WAR  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-230  From the start of its war in Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-231  ...the U.S. Army had found the conflict to be unlike any other.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-232  As Vietcong attacks proved every day, there was no front line.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-233  Each side controlled only the territory...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-234  ...immediately around its positions or its bases.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-235  The Army was calling it Area War.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-236  Area War meant that the roads linking U.S. bases to other units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-237  ...and to their supply depots were never completely secure.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-238  Vietcong strategy was to try and isolate American forces...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-239  ...and to pin down large numbers of U.S. troops on base and road defense.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-240  That way there would be fewer men available for offensive operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-241  The supply lifelines for the 25th and 1st U.S. Infantry Divisions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-242  ...were the roads linking their major bases to Saigon,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-243  ...Bien Hoa airbase,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-244  ...and Long Binh, the biggest supply depot in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-245  The roads were constantly patrolled by armored vehicles and aircraft.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-246  In August 1966 the 25th Division was tasked with clearing the way...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-247  ...for a new American unit the 196th light infantry brigade.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-248  The 196th was to be based at Tay Ninh to secure route 22,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-249  ...running through the NLF base area of Warzone C.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-250  By October 1966, the NLF 9th Division had almost recovered...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-251  ...from the battles of the previous July.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-252  Its losses in men and equipment had been replaced by supplies and reinforcements...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-253  ...sent down the Ho Chi Minh trail from Nort Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-254  With the dry season coming the 9th was busy in Warzone C...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-255  ...preparing for its next offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-256  The renewed activity of the 9th division...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-257  ...did not pass unnoticed by the Americans.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-258  Special Forces units mounted an intense reconaissance effort...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-259  ...deep inside Vietcong territory.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-260  The reports they brought back seemed to show...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-261  ...that the 9th's next target might be the Special Forces' own base camp,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-262  ...Northeast of Tay Ninh city.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-263  American commanders were determined to disrupt the Vietcong's plans.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-264  The 196th Brigade was ordered to mount aggressive Search and Destroy sweeps...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-265  ...near the Special Forces' camp area.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-266  The sweeps starting on September 14th 1966...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-267  ...were codenamed Operation Attleboro.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-268  Operation Attleboro was launched by the 196th Light Infantry Brigade,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-269  ...together with 22,000 South Vietnamese soldiers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-270  ...and G.I.'s from the 1st 4th and 25th Infantry Divisions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-271  Almost at once, huge supply caches belonging to the NLF's 9th Division...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-272  ...were found by the Americans south of the Michelin rubber plantation.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-273  It was believed the NLF were somewhere between the plantation...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-274  ...and the American Special Forces base at Suoi Da.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-275  While one battalion made a helicopter landing,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-276  ...the other battalions pushed towards it on foot.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-277  When the Landing Zone was ambushed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-278  ...both sides sent thousands of reinforcements rushing to the area.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-279  By the following day, full scale battles were raging.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-280  In the first days of Operation Attleboro...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-281  ...almost every fresh American unit sent in was ambushed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-282  Nor were the Americans safe behind the defensive perimeters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-283  ...of their night time camps.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-284  NLF units stroke with thousands of men at a time...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-285  ...and came close to wiping out whole American formations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-286  It was intense air and artillery support that, in the end  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-287  ...as in so many battles, saved the Americans from disaster.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-288  Even then, many of the NLF battalions were attacking out of bunkers,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-289  ...trench lines and tunnels and were sometimes able...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-290  ...to withstand the most punishing bombardments.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-291  The inexperience of the 196th was also telling.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-292  Tactical coordination between the brigade's units was poor.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-293  Although the situation was desperate,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-294  ...American commanders in Saigon also saw a major opportunity.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-295  Attleboro might be a chance to fight the kind big battle they had been looking for.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-296  The 1st Infantry Division raised two brigades to the area...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-297  ...and unit after unit was piled on.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-298  The 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment only just arrived in Vietnam,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-299  ...was also thrown into the battle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-300  Within days there were 22,000 American troops in the Attleboro area.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-301  The massive buildup of American forces was the NLF's cue to disengage.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-302  Although fierce firefights continued wherever the two sides came into contact,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-303  ...the 9th division began to withdraw.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-304  Its big units broke down into smaller groups and slipped away...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-305  ...towards Cambodia where the Americans were forbidden to follow.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-306  In Operation Attleboro, the Americans had failed to destroy...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-307  ...the 9th division in an all out battle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-308  On the other hand, in six weeks more than 1,000 NLF had been killed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-309  ...for the loss of 155 American dead and fewer than 800 wounded.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-310  U.S. troops had captured a massive amount of enemy stores and documents...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-311  ...and Vietcong plans for the coming months had been badly disrupted.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-312  CEDAR FALLS  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-313  By the end of 1966 American forces in Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-314  ...had grown to 385,000 men,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-315  ...plus another 60,000 sailors off Vietnam shores.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-316  As the force levels had risen so too had the casualties.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-317  The year had seen more than 6,000 Americans killed and 30,000 wounded.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-318  The biggest problem for American commanders was...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-319  ...that their time table was slipping badly.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-320  By now, the Vietcong should be losing men faster than they could be replaced.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-321  General Westmoreland had to concede that U.S. forces...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-322  ...had come nowhere near achieving that goal.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-323  An estimated 61,000 Vietcong had been killed in the past year...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-324  ...yet their troops had gone up to more than 280,000.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-325  Part of the problem was that the American bombing campaign...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-326  ...against North Vietnam  and its supply routes to the South were still failing.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-327  More men and materials were reaching the guerrillas than ever before.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-328  The Vietcong had also stepped up the recruiting.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-329  There was one cause for optimism on the American side:  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-330  Operation Attleboro had seemed to show the Vietcong would fight...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-331  ...if their base areas were threatened.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-332  The latest plan was to go back into War Zone C...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-333  ...with even greater forces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-334  But first, the Americans wanted to solve an immediate problem.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-335  The districts just in front of Saigon the Iron Triangle and Cu Chi,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-336  ...were still major Vietcong strongholds.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-337  The American plan was to attack into the Iron Triangle...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-338  ...with more than two divisions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-339  The guerrillas would be trapped in their own base areas and anihilated.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-340  At the same time another attempt would be made...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-341  ...to capture the Vietcong Saigon Military Headquarters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-342  The whole area would then be systematically destroyed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-343  Before the attack American aircraft dropped 20,000 leaflets...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-344  ...telling the population to leave at once.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-345  The Iron Triangle was an area of 60 square miles...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-346  ...lying between the Saigon river and route 13,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-347  ...with the village of Ben Suc on its western side.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-348  A major Vietcong tunnel complex ran under the whole district.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-349  The 272th Regiment of the NLF was operating there...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-350  ...along with two battalions of NLF main force,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-351  ...two independent NLF battalions and the Fil Hol battalion.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-352  But on the eve of the American offensive most troops were withdrawn.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-353  Only local NLF companies were left to defend important installations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-354  The American plan for Operation Cedar Falls...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-355  ...was that the 25th Infantry Division and other units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-356  ...would occupy blocking positions on the western side of the Saigon river...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-357  ...forming an anvil.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-358  The 1st Division and the 173rd airborne brigade would assault...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-359  ...from the North and the East,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-360  ...with a battalion landing at the village of Ben Suc.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-361  Meanwhile, the 11th armored cavalry regiment would act as the hammer...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-362  ...smashing through the center of the triangle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-363  Operation Cedar Falls opened with 4 days of attacks by B-52 bombers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-364  Artillery and air strikes followed  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-365  and a wall of fire was laid down to cut off the NLF's retreat.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-366  On January 8th 1967, 16,000 U.S. ...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-367  ...and 14,000 South Vietnamese Army troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-368  ...moved out of their bases in fleets of helicopters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-369  ...armored personnel carriers, trucks and boats.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-370  In the first hours of Operation Cedar Falls...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-371  ...the village of Ben Suc had been captured with barely a shot fired.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-372  The local company of 100 NLF fighters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-373  ...had been taken completely by surprise.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-374  As the Village's 6,000 inhabitants were rounded out for interrogation...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-375  ...bulldozers began to level every building in sight.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-376  The American Operation to smash the Iron Triangle...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-377  ...lasted 19 days with only local Vietcong left to defend the area...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-378  ...and most of those hidden in tunnels there was almost no heavy fighting.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-379  American losses were 72 killed and 337 wounded...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-380  ...mostly to snipers and booby traps.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-381  In Ben Suc and in the Thanh Dien forest...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-382  ...the Americans uncovered dozens of tunnel entrances.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-383  By now, they were better prepared.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-384  Specialists known as 'tunnel rats' had trained...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-385  ...to go down tunnels and explore.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-386  In the crammed spaces underground...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-387  ...they faced gunfire, booby traps, and mines.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-388  The problem was there were only a handful of tunnel rats...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-389  ... and the complexes were enormous.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-390  Whenever tunnels were found,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-391  ...the Americans made determined efforts to destroy them.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-392  Demolition charges, explosive gas, and flooding were all tried.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-393  Riot control agents were pumped in...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-394  ...to try and force the Vietcong to come out.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-395  Nothing really worked. The tunnels were designed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-396  ...so that neither gas nor water could penetrate far.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-397  The Americans had discovered only a small number...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-398  ...of the Vietcong installations hidden in the Iron Triangle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-399  But those they did find yielded astonishing quantities of material.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-400  There was enough rice to feed 13,000 guerrillas for a year,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-401  ...along with over 7,000 uniforms,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-402  ...a huge underground hospital...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-403  ...and over a ton of medicine.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-404  Half a million documents were discovered,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-405  ...including detailed maps of airbases,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-406  ...and the private addresses of Americans in Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-407  Some U.S. commanders immediately hailed Cedar Falls as a major success.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-408  Westmoreland was much more cautious.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-409  The main NLF headquarters had not been found,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-410  neither had any sizable enemy unit been brought to battle and destroyed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-411  In the end 720 Vietcong had been killed for the loss of 72 Americans.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-412  One aim of Operation Cedar Falls was achieved:  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-413  The Iron Triangle was completely and utterly destroyed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-414  After its inhabitants were moved out to refugee camps...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-415  ...the district was turned into an uninhabitable wasteland.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-416  Huge Rome plows cut 20 foot wide avenues criss crossing the forest...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-417  ...to make any movement instantly visible from the air.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-418  These massive machines could plough the tallest trees into the ground.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-419  60 square miles of forest near Saigon...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-420  ...were ploughed under in the Iron Triangle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-421  Afterwards, Operation Ranch Hand aircraft spread lethal defoliants...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-422  ...to destroy the jungle cover and make it impossible to grow crops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-423  After the Americans had pulled out...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-424  ...almost the whole of the Iron Triangle was designated a free fire zone.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-425  Artillery and bombs could be rained down at will...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-426  ...and anyone that moved could be attacked from the air.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-427  Yet to the astonishment of the Americans within weeks of Operation Cedar Falls,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-428  ...the Vietcong were active again in the Iron Triangle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-429  JUNCTION CITY  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-430  By mid February 1967 American commanders had again...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-431  ...turned their attention to War Zone C and the NLF's 9th division.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-432  The new offensive was codenamed “Junction City”.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-433  Westmoreland had ordered his commanders to think big, and they had planned...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-434  ...the most ambitious Search and Destroy operation of the war so far.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-435  30,000 American troops would take part...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-436  ...together with 5,000 men from the South Vietnamese Army.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-437  The main targets of Operation Junction City were the Vietcong's biggest base areas...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-438  ...and their main military headquarters for South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-439  This was known as the 'Central Office for South Vietnam' or COSVN.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-440  However COSVN never existed as a place.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-441  In reality, the military and political leadership...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-442  ...of the Vietcong were always mobile.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-443  The Vietcong base areas of War zone C held...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-444  ...the 9th Division's three regiments,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-445  ...a regiment of the NLF's new 5th Division,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-446  ...and 2 North Vietnamese Army regiments.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-447  Altogether more than 10,000 troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-448  There were also thousands more...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-449  ...local Vietcong scattered throughout the region.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-450  Operation Junction City called for two American brigades to block...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-451  ...the Vietcong's escape to the West over the Cambodian border.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-452  Two more would block to the East.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-453  Infantry and Airborne forces would close off the North...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-454  ...by helicopter and parachute landing, forming a giant horseshoe.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-455  Armored Cavalry and infantry brigades would then sweep northwards...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-456  ...overrunning all enemy units in their path.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-457  In the second phase of Junction City a series of Special Forces camps...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-458  ...would be built, along with a bridge over the Saigon river  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-459  ...and operations would shift to the East.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-460  By February 21st 1967 the Americans were ready to launch Junction City.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-461  The blocking forces to the West and the East were in place.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-462  All that remained was to insert the Northern force.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-463  In one of the largest air mobile assaults ever,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-464  ...240 helicopters swept over Tay Ninh province.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-465  Fighter bombers and gunship helicopters hammered the landing zones.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-466  Within hours, 2,000 troops were deep inside Vietcong territory.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-467  At the same time, in the first parachute drop of the Vietnam War...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-468  nearly 800 men of the 173rd airborne completed the American horseshoe.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-469  The day after the massed air mobile landings  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-470  Infantry and mechanized units began pushing North into the horseshoe.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-471  The terrain was dense forest.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-472  The whole area was riddled with Vietcong fortifications,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-473  ...tunnels and bunkers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-474  Although there were scattered firefights, the Americans...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-475  ...lost men to snipers and booby traps.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-476  There were few big actions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-477  Often guerrilla installations were found abandoned.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-478  The battles that did happen were started by the Vietcong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-479  Powerful units twice attacked...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-480  ...elements of the 1st infantry division at Prek Klok.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-481  Furious American bombing and artillery fire drove off the assaults.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-482  Because the Vietcong had begun the battles, they were also able...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-483  ...to break off the fight whenever they chose.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-484  Nor were the American blocking forces able...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-485  ...to trap them and make them fight.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-486  The dense vegetation meant the guerrilla battalions could break down...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-487  ...into platoons and filter through American lines.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-488  By now, the Vietcong military leadership the Americans were searching for...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-489  ...had also slipped away across the border into neutral Cambodia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-490  The second phase of Operation Junction City centered around...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-491  ...the building of the Saigon River bridge...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-492  ... and the Special Forces camp at An Loc.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-493  Convoys of trucks shuttled up and down route 13 with building materials.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-494  For defense, artillery fire bases including fire support base 20...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-495  ...were scattered along the road.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-496  Fire Base Gold and Landing Zone George were created...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-497  ...for Search and Destroy sweeps.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-498  Starting on the night of March 18th 1967, each of the three regiments...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-499  ...of the NLF's 9th Division attacked in full strength, 1,000 men at a time.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-500  Each attack was driven off by overwhelming...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-501  ...American air and artillery fire.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-502  Vietcong losses were heavy, but the regiments...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-503  ...escaped complete destruction.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-504  Operation Junction City lasted 72 days.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-505  By its end in May 1967, this operation coupled with the Cedar Falls offensive,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-506  ...had cost 282 American lives, and 1,500 wounded.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-507  Nearly 3,000 Vietcong had been killed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-508  Guerrilla bases had also been overrun and installations destroyed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-509  American troops had captured large quantities of stores,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-510  ...equipment and weapons.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-511  Although some American commanders hailed Junction City...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-512  ...as a turning point in the war,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-513  ...the operation was nearly over before doubts began to surface.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-514  Like Attleboro and Cedar Falls before it, Junction City...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-515  ...had inflicted casualties but there had been no great battles of anihilation.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-516  The Vietcong's regiments were bruised but still intact.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-517  Nor did the Americans or the South Vietnamese Army have...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-518  ...the forces to occupy the area indefinitely.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-519  As soon as they had gone, the Vietcong regiments returned...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-520  ...to rebuild their base areas and reclaim War Zone C.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-521  AFTER THE BATTLE  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-522  In July 1967 the U.S. defense secretary, Robert McNamara...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-523  ...flew to Saigon to discuss strategy with American...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-524  ...and South Vietnamese leaders and officials.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-525  By now, the Vietcong's big units were supposed to be smashed  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-526  instead, Vietcong numbers were still growing, and there was no sign...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-527  ...the enemy was about to give up the fight.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-528  McNamara had already recommended an increase in U.S. troop strength...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-529  ...to more than half a million men.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-530  But now, he doubted even that would produce victory soon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-531  Back in Washington, McNamara advised President Johnson...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-532  ...to plan for a long war in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-533  There should be less emphasis on battlefield victories,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-534  ...more attention should be payed to long term measures like...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-535  ...helping the South Vietnamese government win control of the villages.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-536  Meanwhile, the cost of the war in casualties and dollars...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-537  ...should be kept down in case the American public lost patience.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-538  In the summer of 1967 just as the Americans...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-539  ...resigned themselves to a long war,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-540  ...the Vietnamese communists changed their strategy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-541  For two years, the Vietcong had been patient...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-542  ...content to inflict casualties and keep on fighting.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-543  Now, they meant to risk an all out offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-544  In 1968 they planned to leave their tunnels and bunkers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN04-545  ...and win the war in open battle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-1  BATTLEFIELD VIETNAM  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-2  Countdown to Tet  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-3  In January 1968 NLF guerrillas backed by North Vietnamese troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-4  ...launched a full scale offensive...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-5  ...against the cities and towns of the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-6  For two years they had been cautious avoiding big battles,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-7  but at Tet, the Vietnamese new year, they staked everything...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-8  ...in one all out bid for victory.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-9  The Tet offensive was one of the most stunning surprise attacks  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-10  ...ever launched by an army.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-11  More than 80,000 guerrillas and North Vietnamese troops were thrown  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-12  against the forces of the South Vietnamese government and their American ally.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-13  The battles were on a scale which no one had imagined the Vietcong could achieve.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-14  The fighting even spilled into the American embassy in Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-15  The Tet offensive turned into a military catastrophe for the Vietcong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-16  In clashes of shocking violence,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-17  ...the guerrillas lost most of their best fighters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-18  But in one of the greatest ironies in the history of war  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-19  the Vietcong's military defeat turned into a political victory.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-20  It was a victory that would change the whole course of the war in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-21  PRELUDE TO THE BATTLE  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-22  American forces in South Vietnam had spent 1966...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-23  ...massively building up their numbers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-24  Men and supplies poured in.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-25  Bases, airfields and port facilities were expanded at a frantic pace.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-26  By the start of 1967 the Americans had 389,000 troops  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-27  and were ready to go on the offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-28  The American aim was to defeat the NVA and NLF force  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-29  by now numbering nearly 128,000.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-30  For seven years the NLF had been fighting to overthrow the government...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-31  ...of South Vietnam and reunite the South with the North.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-32  The North was backing them with supplies and men.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-33  And it sent units of the North Vietnamese Army...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-34  ...to fight inside the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-35  American commanders wanted to take on the enemy's big units,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-36  ...the battalions and regiments.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-37  If U.S. forces could destroy them faster than they could be replaced,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-38  ...the war would soon be over.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-39  In fact the American strategy had quickly run into trouble.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-40  After early battles in which enemy regiments...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-41  ...had suffered heavy casualties they had avoided head on clashes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-42  Instead the Vietcong  meant to stick with Hit and Run and ambush.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-43  The Vietcong's tactics caused American casualties to rise sharply.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-44  Instead of big battles there were snipers  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-45  booby traps, and surprise attacks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-46  The Americans grew increasingly frustrated...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-47  as they mounted countless Search and Destroy operations, took casualties...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-48  ...and still failed to find important guerrilla units.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-49  The commander of American forces in Vietnam, General William C. Westmoreland...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-50  ...was determined to make Vietcong fight big battles.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-51  Only then could superior American firepower be used to the full.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-52  One answer, Westmoreland believed, might be...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-53  ...to attack in force into the Vietcong's traditional base areas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-54  These, he was sure, the Vietcong would fight to defend.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-55  By 1967 there were strong American Marine forces...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-56  ...based in the heavily populated coastal areas of Northern South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-57  In the central highlands there were army units including the Air Cavalry division.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-58  However, the greatest concentration of U.S. Army strength was in the Saigon area  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-59  and it was there between the capital and the Cambodian border...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-60  ...that the Americans launched their biggest operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-61  The Vietcong base areas targeted by the Americans...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-62  ...were the Iron Triangle, only 20 miles from the capital Saigon,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-63  ...and War Zone C near the Cambodian border.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-64  Along with War Zone D, these areas held strong NLF regional forces...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-65  ...and the elite 9th division.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-66  Supplied down the Ho Chi Minh trail from North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-67  the bases were springboards for attacks in and around Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-68  In January 1967, the Americans launched Operation Cedar Falls...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-69  ...into the Iron Triangle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-70  Between February and May, Operation Junction City swept War Zone C.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-71  In Cedar Falls and Junction City up to 25,000 Americans...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-72  ...and South Vietnamese Army troops swept through the NLF's base areas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-73  There were hundreds of firefights and several major NLF attacks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-74  ...with assaults by thousands of guerrillas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-75  But the Americans never did succeed in trapping any of the big units.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-76  The Vietcong regiments melted away into forests and swamps or over the border...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-77  into Cambodia were the Americans were forbidden to follow.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-78  Even though US commanders had failed to provoke the big battles they wanted  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-79  ...they were more optimistic than before.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-80  They had done massive damage to the Vietcong's installations...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-81  ...and had captured huge amounts of supplies.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-82  Cedar Falls and Junction City alone had killed nearly 3,000 guerrillas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-83  U.S. forces had also blunted an enemy initiative further North  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-84  where the war was between the Americans and the North Vietnamese Army.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-85  North and South Vietnam were separated by a Demilitarized Zone...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-86  ... inside which troops were not supposed to operate.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-87  South of the Zone the American defense against the North Vietnamese Army...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-88  ...was a string of fire bases.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-89  Khe Sanh, The Rockpile Camp Carroll, Cam Lo  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-90  ...and Dong Ha along route 9, and the newly built Con Thien and Gio Linh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-91  All were controlled by Special Forces units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-92  ...and later the 3rd Marine Division, which constantly swept the surrounding area.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-93  Between January and May 1967...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-94  ...two North Vietnamese Divisions operating out of the DMZ...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-95  ...launched heavy bombardments of these bases.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-96  Ground assaults at Con Thien and Khe Sanh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-97  ...were only driven off after massive aerial bombardments.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-98  Afterwards the Marines continued to patrol aggressively.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-99  The increased North Vietnamese activity on the DMZ...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-100  ...triggered an American plan to reinforce the whole area.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-101  More Marines were moved up and Army units were redeployed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-102  ...from other parts of South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-103  Meanwhile, in the central highlands the Americans intercepted...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-104  ...North Vietnamese Army units moving in from Cambodia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-105  In late May 1967 they were 9 days of continuous battles...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-106  ...which left hundreds of North Vietnamese soldiers dead.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-107  While American ground operations were piling on the pressure...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-108  ...in the first half of 1967  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-109  the U.S. air campaign against North Vietnam had also been stepped up.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-110  The aim of the bombing was to force the North to stop supporting the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-111  In fact, the bombing and the massive ground assaults...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-112  ...were having exactly the opposite effect.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-113  Far from giving up, North Vietnam was preparing...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-114  ...to unleash the biggest offensive of the war so far.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-115  THE LEADERS – North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-116  Time and again, Ho Chi Minh, the aging North Vietnamese president  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-117  ...had proclaimed that the Vietnamese people...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-118  ...were prepared to fight for 20 years.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-119  He insisted they would pay any price to reunite Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-120  ...and drive out the Americans.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-121  Privately, however, Ho and most of the Hanoi leadership had come to believe...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-122  ...that the war could not go on in the same way for much longer.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-123  The problem was not just the casualty rate in the South  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-124  estimated by the Americans to be at least 5,000 troops dead every month.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-125  Such losses could be sustained for a long time yet.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-126  The biggest fear was that the safe base areas in Laos and Cambodia...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-127  ...or perhaps even in the North itself might soon be invaded by the Americans.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-128  There were also worries about how well the morale of the population...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-129  ...would stand up to a bombing campaign that might go on for years.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-130  The North's leaders foresaw that they might have to negotiate...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-131  ...with the Americans sooner or later.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-132  But before that happened they were determined to make one more attempt...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-133  ...to win the war on the battlefield.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-134  In July 1967, the Politburo, led by Party's first secretary Le Duan  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-135  proposed an all out offensive in South Vietnam timed for early 1968.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-136  Up to recently, command of the war effort in the South had been divided...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-137  ...between General Giap, who controlled the North Vietnamese Army's campaigns  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-138  ...and General Thanh, who ran the war further South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-139  And there had been disagreement between them about the planned offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-140  But just as preparations got underway,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-141  General Thanh died of heart disease in a Hanoi hospital.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-142  For years afterward it was thought in the West that he died...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-143  ...as a result of an American bombing raid on his Southern Headquarters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-144  As well as the loss of a charismatic leader...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-145  ...and the shock to the Vietcong's command, it was an ironic turn.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-146  Now Giap was solely responsible for planning the entire campaign.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-147  THE LEADERS – United States/South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-148  Since he had first dispatched combat troops to South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-149  the U.S. President, Lyndon Baines Johnson, had been determined...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-150  ...to limit the war's impact on the American people.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-151  He had refused to call up the reserves  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-152  and he never pushed for any formal declaration of war by congress.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-153  Despite mounting casualties the U.S....  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-154  ...never officially declared war on Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-155  Up to now, Johnson's approach had seemed to pay off.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-156  There was some anti-war feeling, but nothing so serious...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-157  ...as to threaten the President's policy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-158  However, the toll of American combat casualties...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-159  ...now running at more than 600 killed wounded and missing every month...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-160  ...was hardening opposition.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-161  The draft call had been increased yet so far no real attempt had been made...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-162  ...to get the American public support for the war or its aims.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-163  Divisions were beginning to open up...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-164  ...between the president's military and civilian advisors.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-165  The Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted more damaging targets...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-166  ...for the bombing campaign against the North,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-167  ...a widening of the ground campaign into Laos, Cambodia and possibly North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-168  ...and a big increase in troop levels.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-169  On the other hand, the defense secretary, Robert McNamara,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-170  ...strongly opposed escalating the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-171  McNamara believed that widening the conflict would run a real risk...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-172  ...of drawing in communist China or the Soviet Union.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-173  He also believed that the war might be a long one  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-174  and if the American people were to support it, the cost would have to be kept down.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-175  That meant no wider war, and a big effort...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-176  ...to prepare the South Vietnamese Army to take over more of the fighting.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-177  In the face of contradictory advice from his military and civilian advisors  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-178  President Johnson's reaction was to compromise.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-179  The bombing war would be intensified to include a whole range of targets...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-180  ...which would hit the North Vietnamese war effort hard.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-181  On the other hand, there would be no expansion of the ground war,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-182  the Army would get fewer than 50,000 extra men  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-183  and the reserves would not be called up.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-184  On September 29th 1967, President Johnson took a step closer...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-185  ... to those advisors who were arguing against escalating the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-186  At San Antonio, Texas, Johnson declared...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-187  ...that the US would stop bombing North Vietnam if Hanoi promised...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-188  ...not to take advantage of the cease-fire.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-189  There was no response from Northern leaders.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-190  STRATEGY – North Vietnam/The Vietcong  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-191  The great offensive meant to change the course of the war...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-192  ...was to begin with full scale Vietcong attacks on cities, headquarters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-193  ...and radio stations all over South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-194  The shock of the offensive would cause the South Vietnamese Army to collapse.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-195  Government troops would be encouraged to mutiny...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-196  ...and Some might even be persuaded to turn their guns on the Americans.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-197  At the same time as the military offensive, the signal would go out...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-198  ...for a nationwide uprising by the people of South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-199  It would be led by the secret youth leagues and worker's groups...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-200  ...already in place in the cities.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-201  The government would be overthrown and a new NLF led regime...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-202  ...would call for the Americans to leave.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-203  NLF planners believed that with the world looking on  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-204  the Americans would have little alternative but to go.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-205  The success of the general offensive depended on the Vietcong...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-206  ...avoiding the overwhelming firepower of American forces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-207  Fortunately, the cities and towns would be garrisoned...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-208  ...by the much less formidable South Vietnamese Army.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-209  Still, General Giap meant to take no chances.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-210  Large numbers of American troops would be drawn away...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-211  ... of the populated areas by carefully planned diversions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-212  In the last months of 1967 the North Vietnamese Army meant to attack...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-213  ...government troops at Song Be...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-214  ...and the American base at Dak To.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-215  The U.S. Marine outpost at Con Thien would also be hit  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-216  and forces would be massed around Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-217  An elite NLF regiment would also hit the South Vietnamese Army garrison at Loc Ninh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-218  The attacks near South Vietnam's borders would draw American forces away...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-219  ...from their main base areas and deep into the interior.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-220  The general offensive and uprising would then begin.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-221  The Vietcong would attack the national capital Saigon  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-222  most of the country's 44 provincial capitals  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-223  ...and over a hundred other towns.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-224  The last phase would happen at Khe Sanh  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-225  there the NVA would win a major victory over the United States in a huge...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-226  ...set piece battle that would destroy the American will to carry on the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-227  General Giap was sure that surprise would be the key to a successful offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-228  His plan was to choose the one time when no attacks would be expected:  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-229  The new year festival of Tet.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-230  In previous years, an informal cease-fire over the holiday...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-231  ... had seen vast numbers of South Vietnamese Army troops on leave  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-232  celebrating with their families.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-233  Although an attack during Tet would be deeply offensive...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-234  ...to much of the population  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-235  it would be certain to catch the enemy totally unprepared.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-236  STRATEGY – United States / South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-237  Now that Washington had refused to widen the ground war  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-238  General Westmoreland was forced to carry on trying to win...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-239  ...in the same way as before.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-240  His forces would continue to mount relentless offensives...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-241  ...meant to cause the guerrillas such losses they would have to give up.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-242  Meanwhile, there was another war to be fought too.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-243  The NLF still controlled a quarter of the villages in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-244  Attempts by the South Vietnamese government to get back control...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-245  ...of the rural areas had been going on for years.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-246  Various pacification programs had tried to win the people's support...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-247  ... and root out the NLF political organization.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-248  The campaign had failed dismally.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-249  In part because it was poorly coordinated with the American war in the field.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-250  And because successive Saigon regimes and the CIA had alienated the people...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-251  ...with thousands of assassinations of suspected NLF sympathizers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-252  It was also in this year that the Phoenix program of assassinations began.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-253  Washington was now insisting that the two efforts, pacification and the bigger war...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-254  ...had to be pulled together to make one grand strategy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-255  American military planners had always seen the main force Vietcong...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-256  ...in the interior of South Vietnam as the biggest danger.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-257  They threatened the populated areas with attack and, the Americans believed,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-258  ...they supplied men, food and weapons to the local guerrilla units.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-259  In the new plan the American role would still be...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-260  ...to keep main force Vietcong away from the populated areas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-261  However there would now be more emphasis...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-262  ...on what happened behind the American shield.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-263  The village guerrillas would be driven out...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-264  ...by the South Vietnamese Army and militia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-265  Local security would be strengthened and pacified areas would spread out...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-266  ...until they encompassed most of the populated regions of South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-267  American strategists were convinced that if the U.S. military effort...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-268  ...and the government 's pacification program could be made to work together  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-269  they could win the war against the Vietcong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-270  To succeed they would have to get the cooperation...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-271  ...of sometimes skeptical military commanders.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-272  They would also have to do something about the huge number...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-273  ...of different American agencies supporting pacification projects.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-274  All American support for pacification and its multi-million dollar budget...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-275  ...was now placed under one man.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-276  Robert Komer was given the rank of ambassador equal to a four star general...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-277  ...and made Westmoreland's deputy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-278  Everyone knew that Komer faced an enormous task...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-279  ...but in Saigon and Washington there was real optimism.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-280  It looked like the United States at last had a strategy...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-281  ...that could deliver a solid victory in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-282  THE OPPOSING FORCES – The Vietcong  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-283  For the Tet offensive, North Vietnamese leaders had decided...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-284  ...to rely on Vietcong guerrillas for most of the fighting  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-285  ...rather than the regular army.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-286  They believed that the people of the South would be more likely...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-287  ...to join the revolt if the offensive was led by Southerners.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-288  It would also reassure the NLF leadership inside the South...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-289  ...who had a real fear that their role in the war would be taken over by Hanoi.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-290  By late 1967, the NLF and the North Vietnamese Army together  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-291  ...fielded 128,000 main force troops in South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-292  most of them in 152 infantry battalions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-293  There were also hundreds of thousands of regional and local guerrillas  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-294  ...male and female, who would play a major part in the Tet offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-295  Although the Americans believed that local Vietcong guerrillas in the villages...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-296  ...were supplied and supported by the main force units,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-297  ... the opposite was usually the case.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-298  It was the village guerrillas that supported the main force battalions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-299  They collected rice taxes from the local farmers, built up supplies...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-300  ...and provided scouts and screening forces for the big units.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-301  All communist military forces in the Southern part of South Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-302  ...were controlled through the Vietcong's Mobile Headquarters:  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-303  Tthe Central Office for South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-304  Operations further North were commanded from a North Vietnamese Army headquarters  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-305  ...inside the Demilitarized zone.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-306  For the Tet offensive, the NVA would deploy elements of the 341st Division...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-307  ...supported by Vietcong sapper battalions just below the Demilitarized zone.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-308  Three more divisions and a regiment would be deployed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-309  ...around the US Marine base at Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-310  Further South, two divisions supported by Vietcong sappers and artillery units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-311  ...were spread out along the coast...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-312  ...and another was deployed in the central highlands.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-313  The Vietcong fielded three formations of divisional strength...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-314  ...all within 75 miles of Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-315  Countrywide they also had 30 independent main force battalions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-316  ...and more than 60 regional and local battalions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-317  Altogether, the equivalent of ten divisions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-318  During 1967 American fighter bombers would fly 53,000 attack sorties...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-319  ...against the Ho Chi Minh trail.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-320  Their aim was to cut off the flow of forces and weapons...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-321  from the North to the Southern guerrillas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-322  In spite of the massive scale of the bombing campaign  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-323  it was having little real impact...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-324  ...in the Vietcong's build up for the Tet offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-325  The area the bombers had to cover was vast  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-326  and the Vietcong were experts at camouflage.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-327  In the month of July 1967, 480 trucks made the long and arduous journey  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-328  ...from North Vietnam to the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-329  By the end of the year traffic would soar to 3,000 trucks a month.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-330  In fact, on the eve of the offensive, many Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army units  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-331  would have a surplus of modern weapons and equipment.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-332  WEAPONS – The Vietcong  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-333  The North Vietnamese Army and most Vietcong guerrillas were well equipped...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-334  ...with light infantry weapons including the superb AK-47 Kalashnikov assault rifle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-335  They also had a range of medium and heavy machine guns.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-336  Because American aircraft were always on the prowl  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-337  almost everything had to be carried by porters, often at night.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-338  That meant the most valuable weapons were...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-339  ...those that had the hitting power but could still be transported easily.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-340  The Soviet made rocket propelled grenade launcher, the RPG 2...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-341  ...and its replacement, the RPG 7, were lightweight...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-342  ...and highly effective against armor and bunkers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-343  Designed to be fired by one man, the rockets had a range of more than 500 meters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-344  For much longer ranges, the Chinese 75 mm recoilless rifle...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-345  ...the Type 52, was an accurate and powerful weapon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-346  It was able to fire high explosive shells over 6,600 meters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-347  and with a high explosive armor piercing shell...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-348  ...it was effective against armor at up to 800 meters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-349  Its big disadvantage was that if its crew needed to move fast  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-350  ...it was a cumbersome weapon to manhandle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-351  In the rugged terrain of South Vietnam,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-352  ...mortars were by far the most useful of all heavy weapons.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-353  The NLF and the North Vietnamese Army had thousands  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-354  and they were the perfect combination of hitting power, range and portability.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-355  THE TROOPS – The Vietcong  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-356  Although Vietcong forces in the South were estimated by the Americans...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-357  ...to have lost more than 60,000 men in 1967  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-358  they had still managed to keep up their overall numbers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-359  Thousands of North Vietnamese Army troops had been sent down the Ho Chi Minh trail  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-360  ...to join the guerrillas and they now accounted for more than one in five Vietcong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-361  The guerrillas also operated a draft in the villages.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-362  Because men younger than 20 were not called up by the South Vietnamese Army  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-363  most teenagers were still at home and made a huge pool of potential recruits.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-364  Local NLF guerrillas were given only a basic minimum of basic infantry training.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-365  Later on though, if they were recruited to a main force unit  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-366  they could get up to a month of advanced instruction.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-367  There were also dozens of training centers spread all over South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-368  running long courses for squad and platoon leaders  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-369  operators of crew served weapons, and radio men.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-370  To make sure the guerrillas understood what they were fighting for  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-371  all training courses included political instruction.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-372  Most Vietcong attacks planned for the Tet offensive  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-373  were to be led by elite sapper commandos.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-374  Their job would be to launch the initial assaults...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-375  ...blasting their way into enemy headquarters and bases.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-376  Most sappers were part of well trained main force battalions  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-377  but for Tet, the Vietcong would also heavily rely on local sapper units  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-378  men and women, recruited inside the cities.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-379  Many drove pedi-cabs, cyclos and taxis or were chauffeurs and delivery men...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-380  and knew their way around the streets like no one else could.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-381  During the year, as casualties had mounted under the intense pressure  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-382  of the American onslaught, the morale of the Vietcong had suffered badly.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-383  But news of the planned general offensive quickly revived...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-384  ...the confidence of the guerrillas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-385  Political officers worked hard to persuade the troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-386  ... that the campaign would bring the victory they had fought for so long to win.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-387  In the run-up to Tet the rate of desertions from Vietcong units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-388  ...fell away almost to nothing.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-389  THE OPPOSING FORCES – United States / South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-390  By late 1967 there were almost half a million...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-391  ...American military personnel in South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-392  Of these only one in seven were combat troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-393  The rest were the support personnel needed to run a military machine...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-394  ...that relied on high tech weaponry and consumed vast amounts of supplies.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-395  By now American forces in Vietnam were expending 45,000 tons of ammunition...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-396  ...and burning 60 million gallons of fuel every month.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-397  Almost everything came from the United States...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-398  and when it arrived in Vietnam there was a massive problem of storage and distribution.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-399  Huge numbers of men were tied up just handling the supply traffic.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-400  Protecting the dozens of big American installations scattered all over the country  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-401  and securing major road links was another enormous drain on manpower.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-402  During 1967 the new American emphasis on pacification...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-403  ...had led to more attention than ever being payed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-404  ...to improving the South Vietnamese armed forces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-405  The armed forces now numbered more than 340,000 soldiers  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-406  and there were also nearly 300,000 regional troops and other militia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-407  The South Vietnamese also had a small navy for coastal and river patrols  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-408  and an increasingly effective air force.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-409  Its pilots were now flying a quarter...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-410  ...of all combat sorties inside South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-411  The South Vietnamese Army had divided the country...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-412  ...into four tactical zones one for each army corp.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-413  The most northerly zones each deployed two divisions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-414  ...while the zones further South each had three.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-415  The South Vietnamese Air Force had 5 fighter squadrons  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-416  and the navy a force of coastal patrol boats.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-417  The Joint Generals Staff Reserve had an airborne division and two marine brigades.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-418  For easy coordination, the American Military Assistance Command in Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-419  ...had created a Marine Amphibious Force and two field forces...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-420  ...to match three of the South Vietnamese Army's tactical zones.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-421  Altogether the forces deployed two marine and seven army divisions  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-422  two brigades, an armored cavalry regiment, and a Special Forces group.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-423  As well as the Americans, there were two Korean Army divisions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-424  ...and a Marine brigade three Australian battalions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-425  ...and contingents from New Zealand, The Philippines and Thailand.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-426  During 1967 the Americans had launched their first combat operations...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-427  ... in the extreme South of Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-428  Up to then, the maze of rivers and canals of the Mekong Delta...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-429  ... had been left to the South Vietnamese Army.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-430  Now the Mobile Riverine Force a brigade of the US 9th Division...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-431  ...had moved in to help fight the NLF...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-432  ...for control of the richest rice producing area in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-433  The Mobile Riverine Force was unique in the US Army.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-434  Not since the American Civil War had the army deployed a completely amphibious force.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-435  It had its own base, a man made island.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-436  Navy boats carried the troops into action and provided escorts.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-437  Heavy firepower was carried by armored vessels...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-438  named "Monitors" after their Civil War forebears.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-439  During the Tet offensive the Mobile Riverine Force would see heavy fighting.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-440  In the Mekong Delta and the other heavily populated parts...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-441  ...of South Vietnam, the government army would bear the brunt...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-442  ...of the Vietcong's planned offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-443  Some South Vietnamese formations Ranger, Marine and Airborne units  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-444  and a handful of infantry divisions were professional, dedicated and well led.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-445  They knew their battleground and their enemy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-446  But six of the army's eleven divisions were in poor shape  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-447  suffering from corrupt and incompetent officers  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-448  desertion and obsolete equipment.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-449  WEAPONS – United States / South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-450  At the center of American military doctrine was the idea...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-451  ...that troops should be maneuvered to fix the enemy in position...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-452  ...so that firepower could be unleashed to destroy him.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-453  In defense too heavy firepower played a critical part.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-454  Every American infantry division in Vietnam could call on...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-455  ...massive support from aircraft and sometimes from long range artillery.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-456  Divisions had their own artillery as well, mostly 105 mm weapons  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-457  and the divisions always set up fire bases before every operation.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-458  Each company also had its own mortars.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-459  Tanks were used by almost every American division in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-460  The most important tank unit was the 11th Armored Cavalry brigade.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-461  All of them used the M-48 a 44 ton vehicle with a 90 mm gun.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-462  In spite of early doubts about how tanks might fare in Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-463  ...their firepower and armor were invaluable...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-464  ...for securing roads and escorting convoys.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-465  The Marines also deployed the Ontos  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-466  a weapon originally designed as a tank destroyer.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-467  The Ontos mounted six recoilless rifles and during the Tet battles...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-468  ...they proved invaluable for clearing buildings and destroying fortifications.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-469  Of all the armored vehicles deployed in Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-470  ...the most useful by far was the M 113 armored fighting vehicle...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-471  ...known to American troops as "the track".  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-472  It was so vulnerable to mines that its crew usually sat on top  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-473  but it was extremely heavily armed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-474  Tracks mounted several weapons including at least one 50 caliber machine gun  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-475  a weapon too heavy to carry on foot.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-476  The 50 was incredibly destructive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-477  Able to cut a tree in half hundreds of yards away.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-478  The weight of firepower that a track could deliver...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-479  ...and the vast amounts of ammunition it could carry  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-480  saved American units from being overrun time and time again.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-481  One weapon highly valued by the crews of armored vehicles and by foot soldiers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-482  ...was the M-79 grenade launcher called the Dooper, from its sound.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-483  The Dooper's range was up to 250 meters  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-484  and its explosive shell would kill within 15 feet of the blast.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-485  A good grenadier could hit a target the size of an open window...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-486  ...at 100 meters and fire a shell every 3 or 4 seconds.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-487  THE TROOPS – United States / South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-488  For the South Vietnamese conscript soldier  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-489  1967 had begun to show some signs that army life might become bearable.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-490  Food and accommodation improved slightly.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-491  Amongst the professionals and the better units at least, confidence was high.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-492  Many officers and NCO's had been at war for years  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-493  and were both tough and tactically skilled.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-494  But in spite of this, the desertion rate continued to rise.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-495  While the South Vietnamese conscript served four years  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-496  the United States Army had stuck to its policy of bringing soldiers home...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-497  ...after one 13 month tour of duty.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-498  It was effective in preventing combat fatigue  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-499  but the decision was having a real impact on the battlefield.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-500  Units were constantly losing experienced men...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-501  ...who were replaced by newcomers unable to spot booby traps and ambushes...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-502  and not yet used to Vietnam's punishing climate.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-503  Officers served only six months in combat...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-504  ...and new arrivals had a very high chance of being killed or wounded.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-505  “Drop back about five meters, five meters”  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-506  American combat units on the field were almost always seriously under strength.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-507  With operations running all the time...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-508  ...and the men perpetually short of sleep  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-509  ...exhaustion was beginning to tell on morale.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-510  So too was boredom and sometimes disillusion.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-511  Returning again and again to the same places...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-512  on exhausting Search and Destroy sweeps often seemed utterly pointless.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-513  EVE OF BATTLE  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-514  In the early autumn of 1967 as communist forces...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-515  ...were building up for the Tet offensive  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-516  the internal divisions that had plagued both sides throughout the war...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-517  ...began to come to a head.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-518  In Hanoi 200 senior officers were arrested  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-519  in a crackdown on opponents of the Tet strategy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-520  In Washington, Robert McNamara  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-521  the increasingly disillusioned defense secretary  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-522  had lost the confidence of the president and would soon resign.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-523  As for Johnson himself he faced a presidential election...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-524  ...late in 1968, and there was already opposition...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-525  ...from within his own democratic party.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-526  Meanwhile on the streets, opposition to American involvement in Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-527  ...was growing more and more vocal.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-528  As Johnson's popularity slipped to an all time low  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-529  he clung to his belief that the public could be persuaded...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-530  ...to back his conduct of the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-531  He embarked on a huge public relations campaign...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-532  in which Washington and Saigon pumped out masses of information  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-533  all supporting the line that the war was being won.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-534  President Johnson toured military bases around the country and even recalled  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-535  ...General Westmoreland from Vietnam to add his weight to the argument.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-536  Speaking to one influential gathering after another...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-537  ...Westmoreland assured his listeners that the end was almost in sight.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-538  What the General did not know was that halfway around the world  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-539  in the forests and mountains of South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN05-540  the first phase of the communist offensive had already begun.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-1  BATTLEFIELD VIETNAM  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-2  The Tet Offensive  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-3  In April 1967...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-4  North Vietnamese Army units opened their biggest offensive of the Vietnam war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-5  Their role was to draw American forces into the remotest parts of South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-6  ...far away from the populated areas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-7  The hope was that the main attacks scheduled for early 1968  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-8  would find the Americans deployed in all the wrong places.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-9  Fighting began at the end of March when a strategic Marine patrol  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-10  ...ran into an ambush near one of the strategic hills...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-11  ...that lay between the fire bases of Khe Sanh and Con Thien.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-12  Dozens of Marines were killed during this first brief and unforeseen combat.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-13  The North Vietnamese had by then assembled nearly 2,000 men...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-14  ...near the base at Con Thien and almost every day they hit the Marines...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-15  ...with artillery, rockets and mortars.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-16  In the rugged countryside around there were savage battles...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-17  ...as patrols from each side clashed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-18  ...into what became known as the hill fights.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-19  During these battles, 160 Marines were killed and 700 wounded.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-20  The NVA resisted with such courage that as a mark of respect  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-21  he Marines who usually called the Vietcong “Charlie”...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-22  ...rechristened them “Mr. Cong”.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-23  But in the end, it was the sheer weight of American firepower...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-24  ...that turned the tables at Con Thien.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-25  Repeated NVA assaults were broken  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-26  and more than 900 North Vietnamese soldiers were killed by Marine artillery  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-27  massive bombing, and the guns of naval vessels offshore.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-28  After the battles at Con Thien the next clashes were...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-29  ...near the border with Cambodia in the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-30  At Song Be in late October 1967 a South Vietnamese Army battalion...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-31  ...was attacked by the North Vietnamese 88th Regiment.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-32  The attackers were driven off with help from heavy American airstrikes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-33  Two days earlier, Loc Ninh, another provincial capital, had been stormed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-34  ...by the elite 273rd regiment of the 9th Vietcong division  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-35  supported by the 65th regiment of the NVA.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-36  Reinforcements from the South Vietnamese 5th Division and the American 1st  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-37  ...fought for several days and shattered the NVA regiment...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-38  ...leaving over  850 NVA and NLF dead.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-39  The fiercest of all the border battles was near an American camp...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-40  ...at Dak To in the Central Highlands which had been massively reinforced...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-41  ...following a tip off from an NVA deserter.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-42  By November 1967, the 1st NVA division reinforced by two independent regiments  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-43  faced the American 4th infantry Division the 173rd Airborne brigade  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-44  and a mechanized task force.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-45  Bloody battles would rage around Dak To for the whole month.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-46  Of all the desperate encounters of the battle of Dak To  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-47  the most costly for both sides was the fight for hill 875.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-48  In the Highlands, whoever controlled the hills...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-49  ...could rain down mortar and artillery fire on the valleys.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-50  The task of taking hill 875 fell to two American battalions  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-51  one airborne, and one from the 4th infantry division.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-52  Supporting them were fighters B-52 bombers, and artillery...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-53  ...blasting the enemy defenses with high explosives and napalm.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-54  170,000 artillery shells were fired on the enemy during this battle  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-55  and the fighter-bombers flew 2,100 missions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-56  The North Vietnamese defenders were so well dug in and so determined...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-57  ...that the Americans were forced to launch repeated assaults  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-58  ...punctuated by yet more air strikes...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-59  ...before they could reach the crest of the hill.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-60  It was a desperate and often nightmarish battle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-61  It took a full week to capture hill 875.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-62  The assaults cost more than 150 dead and 400 wounded  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-63  bringing American casualties at Dak To to almost 350...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-64  ...with just under 1,000 wounded.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-65  The North Vietnamese Army had lost 1,200 men.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-66  In December 1967 the dry season had just begun in the Southern provinces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-67  Every year that was the signal for intense Vietcong activity...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-68  as the guerrillas moved troops and supplies into place for the next offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-69  At the headquarters of Military Assistance Command Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-70  near Saigon, General Westmoreland and his senior officers ran...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-71  a series of studies to try and predict where the enemy would strike in 1968.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-72  The enemy's Tet offensive though it had been predicted  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-73  took the US command by surprise.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-74  They suspected the Vietcong would concentrate their efforts...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-75  ...on the Northern part of the country.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-76  The North Vietnamese Army would use up to 5 divisions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-77  to try and capture South Vietnam's two Northernmost provinces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-78  Other attacks on the Highlands and near Saigon could provide the diversion.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-79  To counter the expected Northern thrust the Americans decided...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-80  ...to send up their most mobile reaction force, the 1st Air Cavalry Division.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-81  In early January 1968 the division began the massive task...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-82  of moving North together with other US and South Vietnamese troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-83  By now, three quarters of American battalions in the South of Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-84  were deployed deep in the interior near the Cambodian border.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-85  Unknown to them, elements of the NLF's 9th, 7th and 5th Divisions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-86  along with other units were already heading towards the capital for the Tet offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-87  The Americans, suspicious of increased NLF radio traffic behind them...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-88  and the lack of activity in the border areas  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-89  began a rapid redeployment back towards Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-90  American forces were pulled back from the border areas with astonishing speed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-91  Such incredible mobility was something the Vietcong had never expected.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-92  The ploy to use the battles on the borders to draw the Americans away...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-93  ...from the real targets of the Tet offensive had failed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-94  although it had allowed NLF forces to get closer to Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-95  It was Lieutenant General Frederick Weyand...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-96  ...the commander of the US II Field Force  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-97  that had requested the American redeployment.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-98  Soon more than half his battalions were again at bases close to Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-99  Weyand ordered a series of sweeps to try and find the Vietcong units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-100  ...that were surely somewhere within reach.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-101  The Americans were now convinced that a major offensive was coming soon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-102  However no one imagined that the Vietcong were planning...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-103  ...coordinated attacks across the whole country.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-104  Neither did anyone guess that they meant to break...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-105  ...the traditional Tet new year truce.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-106  As a precaution, the Americans did ask the South Vietnamese government...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-107  ...to call off the truce and cancel army leave  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-108  but for political reasons the request was refused.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-109  TET!  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-110  By the last week in January 1968 the Vietcong had almost completed  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-111  the massive task of deploying 84,000 guerrillas for the Tet offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-112  Most of the movement of troops and supplies...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-113  had successfully been kept secret.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-114  Even villagers who didn't support the Vietcong stayed neutral  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-115  and few reports of guerrilla activity...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-116  ...reached the government's intelligence agencies.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-117  The traditional Vietcong base areas around Saigon  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-118  districts like the Iron Triangle, played a vital part...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-119  ...in the Vietcong 's preparations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-120  Even the huge tunnel complex at Cu Chi  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-121  which the Americans had long believed had been completely destroyed  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-122  was still an important staging area and command center.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-123  Nearer the city, the growing crowds of travelers arriving for the Tet celebrations  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-124  covered the infiltration of guerrillas and their weapons.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-125  As Tet grew closer, General Giap  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-126  the North Vietnamese commander and architect of the offensive  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-127  began to worry that his forces might not be in place on time.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-128  As it happened, dozens of attacks were launched a full day too soon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-129  The North was still using the old calendar  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-130  ...that gave Tet as the 31st of January.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-131  In the South, the official new year was the 30th of January.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-132  The wave of Vietcong assaults in the early morning of January 30th 1968  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-133  confirmed to the Americans that the suspected offensive was underway.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-134  General Westmoreland ordered all his forces to be on maximum alert.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-135  At the same time, the South Vietnamese prime minister Nguyen Van Thieu...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-136  announce that the Tet truce was over and cancelled the army's leave.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-137  36 of the 44 provincial capitals were attacked...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-138  ...as were five of the nation's cities.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-139  The premature attacks should have been a disaster for General Giap's plan  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-140  but in fact they were a great success  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-141  and Giap still had at least some elements of  tactical surprise.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-142  American attention remained fixed on the northern border  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-143  where Westmoreland expected the real offensive to come.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-144  There, the Marine combat base at Khe Sanh had already been under siege for ten days.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-145  In the rest of the country, although headquarters had sent out warnings  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-146  alerts happened all the time and there was no real sense of urgency.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-147  Half the South Vietnamese troops were still away from their units on leave.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-148  Even in the capital Saigon, the Vietcong 's most important objective  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-149  government forces were scattered and under strength.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-150  In the days leading up to Tet eleven Vietcong battalions  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-151  mostly local units, had assembled for the main assaults inside Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-152  The spearhead force was the C-10 local sapper commando battalion.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-153  Outside the city, elements of the 5th 7th and 9th Vietcong Divisions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-154  and two independent battalions were positioned to attack American bases  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-155  block roads, and reinforce the city units.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-156  The government forces responsible for the defense of Saigon  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-157  were the South Vietnamese Army's 5th Ranger group, three regional militia units  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-158  and two Military Police battalions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-159  However, two elite airborne battalions were also in the city  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-160  at Tan Son Nhut airport, on their way North.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-161  The only American units inside Saigon were the 716th US Army Military Police Battalion  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-162  and a Marine Security Guard Detachment.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-163  The Vietcong plans for the attacks inside Saigon...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-164  ...had been worked out to the last detail.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-165  Most of the assaults were to be carried out by units of C-10.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-166  The Independence Palace, the offices of the South Vietnamese president  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-167  would be hit first.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-168  Next on the list was the Joint General Staff headquarters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-169  of the South Vietnamese Army, near to the American's main headquarters in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-170  Tan Son Nhut airbase was to be seized...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-171  along with the South Vietnamese Navy headquarters and the American Embassy  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-172  the main symbol of U.S. power in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-173  The government radio station would also be occupied.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-174  After the initial assaults by C-10 the main Vietcong battalions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-175  were to sweep into the city from all sides to support the offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-176  In the early morning of January 31st 1968  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-177  Vetcong units the length and breadth of South Vietnam searched into action.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-178  In more than 100 cities and towns, shock assaults by Vietcong sapper commandos...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-179  were followed by wave after wave of supporting troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-180  In Saigon, as one attack after another had erupted, there was complete confusion.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-181  Neither the South Vietnamese Army nor the Americans...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-182  had a plan to deal with anything like this.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-183  The army's units were under strength and scattered  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-184  while the American MP's of the 716th battalion...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-185  had been left out of the alert issued the day before.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-186  Only 300 Military Police were on duty.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-187  Of the many attacks the Vietcong unleashed in Saigon...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-188  on the morning of January 31st, the assault on the government radio station...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-189  ...was the best organized.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-190  The station was captured and the plan was to broadcast a tape...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-191  ...of Ho Chi Minh calling for the population to rise up against the government.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-192  Ho's message never was broadcast.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-193  The station's electricity was cut off by the army in the first minutes of the attack.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-194  After a fierce six hour battle, government soldiers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-195  ...including  paratroopers brought in from the airport...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-196  ...succeeded in forcing out the surviving Vietcong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-197  Barely a mile away, at the Independence Palace, and the nearby Navy headquarters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-198  the Vietcong attackers had been driven away from their main targets within minutes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-199  The sapper team had been forced to hold up in a nearby building.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-200  The fight lasted more than fifteen hours.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-201  In the end nearly all the Vietcong inside were killed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-202  Although US Military Police were involved in fire fights all over the city  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-203  in fact very few American installations had been targeted in Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-204  The exception was the American Embassy  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-205  the ultimate symbol of U.S. support for South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-206  The assault on the American Embassy began at 2:30 am on January 31st.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-207  15 sapper commandos blew a hole in the wall of the compound...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-208  ...and charged through the breach.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-209  The fighters had killed 4 American Military Police guards and a Marine  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-210  but their own officers had been killed almost at once.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-211  The sappers took cover and waited for reinforcements.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-212  Soon the Vietcong were trapped within the compound under fire from all sides.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-213  The fight for the compound lasted for six hours...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-214  but the effects of the battle would last much longer.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-215  All around the world an abiding image had been created:  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-216  That of American troops battling to recapture their own embassy...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-217  ...in the very heart of Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-218  THE COMMAND CENTERS  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-219  The Vietcong attack on the American Embassy...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-220  and most other targets in Saigon city center had been launched...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-221  ...by the elite sapper commandos of the C-10 battalion.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-222  The plan was that a follow up force of 4,000 would arrive quickly.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-223  But time and time again the main battalions had been bogged down...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-224  ...in firefights and house to house battles.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-225  One of the sharpest clashes yet...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-226  ...had happened near an American Officers Quarters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-227  The battle had quickly drawn in Military Police...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-228  ...and any other U.S. personnel that could grab a weapon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-229  During the night, a truck carrying 25 American Military Policemen to the fight  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-230  ...was hit by a VC rocket head on and subsequent machine gun fire...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-231  ...killed 16 Americans in a narrow street.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-232  Relief attempts had developed into a furious engagement...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-233  ...which would go on for 12 hours.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-234  Only a few miles away, Tan Son Nhut airbase...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-235  ...was one of the most important centers of American power in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-236  The defenders of Tan Son Nhut were a squadron of US Air Force police  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-237  ...two platoons of Army headquarters guards...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-238  and the only two companies of South Vietnamese Army airborne troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-239  ...not yet committed to battle elsewhere in the city.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-240  On the perimeter of Tan Son Nhut the Vietcong had seized...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-241  several key buildings as springboards for their main assault...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-242  ...and attacked the compound containing the villas of Senior Officers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-243  ...of the South Vietnamese General Staff.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-244  The guerrillas meant to hit the base from three sides...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-245  ...with more than 1,000 troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-246  A large textiles plant was occupied...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-247  ...as the base for their heavy machine guns and rockets.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-248  Only the arrival of an armored reconnaissance unit of the 25th Infantry division...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-249  ...that had raced to the scene from its base 15 miles away, saved Tan Son Nhut.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-250  The tanks and APC's hit the attackers from behind...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-251  ...and in furious fighting had split the Vietcong force.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-252  In the hours that followed the guerrillas were hammered...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-253  ...by American helicopter gunships and fighter-bombers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-254  The attack on Tan Son Nhut was soon completely broken.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-255  15 miles North of Saigon, was the massive...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-256  American logistical complex at Long Binh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-257  Nearby was the US base at Bien Hoa  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-258  and between them, the headquarters of II Field Force and 3 Corps...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-259  from which the American and South Vietnamese battles in the Saigon Area...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-260  ...were being coordinated.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-261  The main attacking forces were two full regiments of the Vietcong 5th Division.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-262  After a heavy rocket and mortar barrage, the 275th assaulted...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-263  Long Binh from the North side while...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-264  ...a local force battalion mounted a diversionary raid  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-265  ...and sappers blew up part of a massive ammunition dump outside the main complex.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-266  At the same time the 274th hit Bien Hoa...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-267  ...and a local battalion tried to seize 3 Corps headquarters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-268  The American 199th light infantry brigade defending Long Binh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-269  ...was attacked by a mechanized reserve...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-270  ...which hit the flank of the Vietcong attacking Bien Hoa.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-271  A unit of the 101st Airborne Division was airlifted in...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-272  ...while helicopter gunships and more mechanized units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-273  ...joined the day long battle  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-274  eventually driving the Vietcong away from all their objectives.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-275  For American commanders faced with the huge scale...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-276  ...of the Vietcong assault in and around Saigon  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-277  Tet had been an extraordinary test of nerve.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-278  It had seemed as if the enemy was everywhere at once.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-279  Throughout the day, General Weyand had been directing the American battle...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-280  ...even as his own headquarters at Long Binh was under attack.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-281  In the first two hours of the Tet offensive Weyand had deployed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-282  5,000 airborne and armored reinforcements  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-283  more than 500 Armored Personnel Carriers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-284  ...mounting their deadly 50 caliber machine guns had been sent into combat.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-285  So far all the main Vietcong assaults had been at least contained.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-286  But no one doubted there was still hard fighting ahead.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-287  “How would you assess the enemy's purposes of yesterday today?”  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-288  “The enemy, very deceitfully, has taken advantage of the Tet truce...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-289  ...in order to...  create... maximum consternation...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-290  within South Vietnam particularly in the populated areas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-291  In spite of the temptation to throw everything he had...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-292  ...into the battle against the guerrillas  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-293  General Westmoreland was determined to hold back.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-294  He was still convinced that the Tet attacks were a diversion from the main effort...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-295  ...which he expected to come in the Northern border areas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-296  He was deeply reluctant to commit his most mobile forces to street battles.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-297  By now, Westmoreland knew that the Vietcong attacks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-298  were being countered successfully all over the country  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-299  but at a great cost to American lives.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-300  The South Vietnamese Army was standing up well.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-301  The next stage would be to defeat the guerrillas...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-302  town by town and battalion by battalion.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-303  In the far South of Vietnam in the heavily populated Mekong Delta  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-304  the Tet offensive had seen Vietcong assaults...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-305  on nearly all of the 16 provincial capitals.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-306  Can Tho, the South Vietnamese Army IV Corp headquarters was also hit.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-307  Route 4 was cut in 62 places.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-308  In the Central and  Northern provinces, 11 cities, towns and bases  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-309  including II Corps headquarters, had been attacked...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-310  ...in the premature offensive of January 30th.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-311  8 more had been hit the following night.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-312  All the major attacks would be repulsed within a week except in one city.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-313  The assault of the old Vietnamese imperial capital of Hue...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-314  would lead to the biggest and bloodiest battle of the whole Tet offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-315  The city of Hue was the third largest in South Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-316  ...and the ancient capital of its former emperors.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-317  It was split in two by the Perfumed River...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-318  ...over which ran key rail and road bridges.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-319  On the North side of the river was the Citadel, a walled city within the city  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-320  surrounded by a maze of streets and originally the home of the emperor.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-321  Near the Citadel was the headquarters of the 1st South Vietnamese Army Division.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-322  On the other side of the river was the American Headquarters compound.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-323  The only South Vietnamese unit inside Hue...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-324  ...was the elite Black Panther Reconnaissance company.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-325  The assault on Hue was launched by two local Vietcong battalions  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-326  elements of the 6th regiment of the 325th NVA Division  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-327  and the 4th independent regiment.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-328  Within 24 hours Hue fell to 5,000 NVA troops  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-329  who were quickly reinforced by a further 7,000.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-330  They instantly raised the North Vietnamese flag over the Citadel.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-331  Thousands of NVA troops ranged through the streets...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-332  ...mopping up pockets of resistance and most of Hue was quickly secured.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-333  The exceptions were small areas around...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-334  ...the American and South Vietnamese headquarters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-335  There the defenders held out and had been reinforced by small units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-336  ...rushed in from outside the city.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-337  The U.S. Marines and South Vietnamese troops that had come to the aid...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-338  ...of their beleaguered headquarters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-339  ...had run a gauntlet of NVA forces to get into the city.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-340  Bigger units were battling to follow them...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-341  but it would be days before they would get inside Hue in any strength.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-342  Meantime it was clear that the North Vietnamese Army meant to remain  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-343  and would not be dislodged without a major battle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-344  THE TIDE TURNS  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-345  By the second day of the Tet offensive it was clear to Vietcong commanders  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-346  ...that the attacks in Saigon were in trouble.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-347  The assault teams had been driven out of most of their main objectives.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-348  The promised reinforcements had rarely arrived...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-349  ...and even nearby units had often failed to support each other.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-350  Secrecy meant that they usually knew nothing of any orders but their own.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-351  The fight for Saigon had by now settled into a large number of separate battles...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-352  ...raging in different parts of the city.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-353  Often the Vietcong were completely surrounded by government forces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-354  Isolated units now faced concentrated assaults...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-355  from armored vehicles planes and helicopters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-356  In spite of the setbacks the Vietcong had succeeded...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-357  in winning control of huge areas of Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-358  To many Vietcong fighters it seemed that victory was at last in sight.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-359  They had been promised that the people of Saigon...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-360  ...would rise up to support them.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-361  If they did, the war could be won soon  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-362  whatever happened on the battlefield.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-363  At the same time as the attacks on Saigon  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-364  the Vietcong had launched powerful assaults on the surrounding towns.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-365  The headquarters of the 18th South Vietnamese Army Division was also hit.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-366  The headquarters had held out and the town had been retaken...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-367  ...after fierce fights by American South Vietnamese and Australian units.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-368  As part of an attempt to surround Saigon...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-369  ...and cut off the capital from reinforcements  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-370  the Vietcong 273rd regiment launched a massive assault on the town of Thu Duc  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-371  which contained one of the two South Vietnamese military academies.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-372  The regiment took heavy losses but the following day...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-373  ...it seized the Newport Bridge over the Saigon river.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-374  Together, South Vietnamese and American units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-375  captured the bridge after a violent battle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-376  At the high point of the Vietcong assault on Saigon  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-377  the guerrillas occupied whole tracts of the West and South of the city.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-378  They used the Phu Tho racetrack as a major assembly area.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-379  The American 199th light infantry brigade launched an all out assault...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-380  on the racetrack buildings driving the Vietcong into the streets around.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-381  By the fourth day of the Tet battles the Vietcong were being squeezed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-382  into the sprawling and crowded district of Cholon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-383  The drive to clear the Vietcong from their last stronghold of Cholon  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-384  and other parts of Saigon would last more than a month.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-385  Like the battles to clear residential districts all over South Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-386  ...the fighting would be immensely costly in lives.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-387  Everywhere, instead of surrendering en masse,...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-388  the guerrillas were fighting back with determination and skill.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-389  Most Vietcong units committed to the Tet offensive...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-390  had made no plans for a possible retreat.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-391  The hopes of Vietcong leaders were now fading fast.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-392  They were forced to accept that the Tet offensive was failing.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-393  The South Vietnamese Army had been meant to collapse or even join the guerrillas  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-394  but instead most of its units had bravely chosen to fight.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-395  According to General Giap, it was their skill and determination  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-396  ...that largely blunted the North's Tet offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-397  Even more disastrous, the uprising...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-398  that was supposed to have seen thousands of civilians...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-399  storming government buildings and proclaiming the revolution, had not happened.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-400  On February 17th 1968 the Vietcong launched...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-401  ...sudden mortar and rocket attacks all over South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-402  The attacks were no more than a symbolic gesture.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-403  A few days later, the Vietcong high command ordered its units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-404  to pull back from the cities to regroup and refit the remaining forces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-405  HUE  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-406  When the Vietcong high command ordered its guerrilla units to withdraw from the cities...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-407  ...it made one clear exception:  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-408  The city of Hue was not to be abandoned.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-409  Although South Vietnamese Army and American forces had launched...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-410  ...a determined counter assault Hue was too valuable a price to lose.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-411  By the fourth day of the Hue battle 1,000 more South Vietnamese Army troops  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-412  ...had been airlifted to the city.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-413  The Americans had been reinforced by 1,200 Marines.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-414  Fierce assaults had been launched on the gates of the Citadel...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-415  and into the streets of the Southern city.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-416  By now the 12,000 NVA and NLF troops in and adjacent to Hue...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-417  ...had fortified almost every city block.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-418  The attackers were forced to advance down narrow streets...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-419  ...and through gardens fighting their way from house to house.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-420  Around every corner there were strong points bristling with heavy weapons.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-421  Any house or wall could conceal a heavily armed NVA assault group.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-422  At the start of the battle  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-423  in the hope of saving the imperial city from complete destruction  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-424  the South Vietnamese had insisted that the Americans not use artillery...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-425  or aircraft to destroy enemy fortifications.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-426  After five days of fierce and bloody fighting, most restrictions were lifted.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-427  Bombers and artillery support were called in to hit NVA strong points.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-428  Most devastating of all, the guns of American warships joined the battle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-429  Directed by Marine spotters the ships fired thousands of shells...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-430  ...into the city from 14 miles away.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-431  Meanwhile in spite of frantic American efforts  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-432  U.S. reinforcements West of the city...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-433  ...were still struggling to reach the battle zone.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-434  When the Tet offensive had begun it had caught the American 1st Air Cavalry division...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-435  ...in the middle of its redeployment from further South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-436  The division was split with its headquarters and 3rd brigade at Camp Evans  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-437  ...and its main logistical base at Phu Bai.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-438  When the North Vietnamese had begun their attack on Hue, they had cut highway 1...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-439  ...the vital road link between the Air Cavalry's fighting units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-440  ...and its stocks of fuel and ammunition.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-441  Meanwhile, the NVA had a clear supply line running from the A Shau Valley...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-442  ...into Hue, and a ring of anti aircraft defenses around the city.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-443  The Air Cavalry could send only a single battalion to advance on Hue.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-444  It was dispatched without artillery support  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-445  and with air cover impossible because of bad weather  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-446  the battalion was cut off and only just escaped annihilation.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-447  It would take nearly three weeks for the 1st Cavalry division  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-448  ...to assemble the men, fuel and ammunition it needed to start cutting...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-449  ...the North Vietnamese Army supply lines into Hue.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-450  By the twelfth day of the battle for Hue city  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-451  South Vietnamese units had reoccupied parts of the Citadel.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-452  The Americans had almost cleared the city South of the river...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-453  ...and had been reinforced by 500 more Marines.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-454  The North Vietnamese still had open supply lines to the West  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-455  and were able to launch aggressive counterattacks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-456  But with the Marines now pressing into the old city  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-457  the NVA position was deteriorating fast.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-458  To help defend the Citadel, the Truong Tien bridge across the Perfumed river  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-459  ...had been blown up by a Vietcong demolition team.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-460  Supplies and reinforcements for the South Vietnamese Army and the U.S. Marines...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-461  ...fighting inside the Citadel had to be sent by landing craft.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-462  It was a hazardous journey.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-463  The boats had to skirt an enemy held area...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-464  ...and sail under the guns of NVA troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-465  During the following week, as the Americans and the South Vietnamese...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-466  ...blasted their way deeper into the city  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-467  the sheer weight of their firepower began to tell on the NVA.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-468  Their commander asked for permission to pull out.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-469  But he was told he had to fight on.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-470  The battle continued through to the night of February 23rd  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-471  with days and nights of savage fighting...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-472  ...before the NVA were finally driven from their last redoubt...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-473  ...in the Citadel's imperial palace  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-474  and the Stars and Stripes was raised above it.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-475  Retaking Hue cost nearly 400 South Vietnamese Army...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-476  ...and more than 140 U.S. Marines lives.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-477  5,000 NVA and Vietcong died in the city...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-478  ...and a further 3,000 in the adjacent fighting.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-479  5,800 civilians were caught in the crossfire...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-480  ...or killed by NVA forces in the first days of the occupation.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-481  American firepower, bombs and artillery...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-482  ...had reduced 80% of the city to rubble.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-483  AFTERMATH  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-484  By the end of the city battles 37,000 Vietcong troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-485  ...deployed for the Tet offensive had been killed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-486  Many more had been wounded or captured, and the fighting had created...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-487  ...more than half a million civilian refugees.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-488  The casualties had included most of the Vietcong's best fighters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-489  ...and many political officers and secret organizers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-490  For the guerrillas it was nothing less than a catastrophe.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-491  But for the Americans who lost 2,500 men  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-492  it would prove to be a most severe blow to public support.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-493  Vietcong leaders were now forced to claim that Tet...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-494  ...had always been intended as a series of offensives, not just one push.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-495  To keep up some kind of momentum two more waves of attacks were planned  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-496  one for May and another for the following September.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-497  The guerrillas also meant to tighten their grip on the countryside...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-498  ...now mostly abandoned by government forces...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-499  ...drawn in to the city fighting.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-500  In the battles, the Americans had lost more than 2,500 men...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-501  and nearly 8,000 had been wounded.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-502  The South Vietnamese Army had suffered much worse.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-503  Its best units had been hit so hard...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-504  ...they would be useless for up to a year.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-505  Meantime American forces would spearhead follow up operations against the Vietcong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-506  Starting March 11th 1968, massive Search and Destroy sweeps were launched...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-507  ...against the Vietcong remnants around Saigon and in other parts of the country.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-508  On March 16th one of these operations resulted in the now infamous massacre...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-509  ...by U.S. Charly company of over 200 civilians at the hamlet of My Lay.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-510  Altogether nearly 20,000 Americans and 9,000 South Vietnamese troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-511  ...rained throughout the Iron Triangle, Cu Chi district...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-512  ...and other long time Vietcong strongholds.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-513  In three weeks, possibly 3,500 Vietcong were killed  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-514  and their ability to pose a serious threat to the capital...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-515  ...was delayed for the foreseeable future.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-516  The Tet battles had delivered a massive victory to American military leaders.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-517  What they wanted was an all out push to win the war  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-518  including ground offensives into Laos and Cambodia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-519  The Joint Chiefs of Staff asked for 2,600 extra men...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-520  ...half for Vietnam, the rest to boost the reserves.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-521  The answer from the White House was 'No'.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-522  Tet had changed everything.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-523  THE CROSSROADS  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-524  To the American public already disillusioned with the war  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-525  the Tet battles had come as a dreadful shock.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-526  If the communists were close to defeat  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-527  as the president and the military had claimed so often  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-528  how could they have launched a nationwide offensive on such a scale?  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-529  By now, support for President Johnson's handling of the war...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-530  ...was at an all-time low.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-531  He faced a reelection battle in the fall, and inside his own party  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-532  Eugene McCarthy and Robert Kennedy were opposing him on an anti-war platform.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-533  Even his own advisors especially Clark Clifford  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-534  the new defense secretary were coming out against the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-535  The pressure on Johnson was overwhelming.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-536  On March 31st 1968 on national television  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-537  the president announced a new American peace initiative  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-538  He invited the North Vietnamese to negotiate and stated that...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-539  as a goodwill gesture, he was curtailing the bombing campaign against the North.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-540  He also made a dramatic announcement about his own future.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-541  “I shall not seek, and I will not accept...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-542  ...the nomination of my party for another term as your president.”  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-543  Within days of the president's speech, Clark Clifford...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-544  ...ordered officials to start planning for a new American strategy in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-545  The South Vietnamese Army would be built up  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-546  so it could gradually take over the fighting itself.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-547  Meanwhile, the US would work for a negotiated peace with the North.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-548  For the United States, it was the beginning of a new phase in the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN06-549  The start of a long and costly battle to disengage from Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-1  BATTLEFIELD VIETNAM  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-2  War on the DMZ  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-3  In early 1968, United States Marines fought the North Vietnamese Army...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-4  in one of the most bitterly contested battles of the Vietnam War.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-5  For 77 days 20,000 NVA troops laid siege...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-6  ...to the Marine combat base at Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-7  At stake was the control of the gateway to South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-8  The siege of Khe Sanh was the longest single battle of the Vietnam War.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-9  It was also one of the most violent.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-10  There were savage artillery duels  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-11  mass infantry assaults and fierce hand to hand combat.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-12  Khe Sanh also saw the most concentrated tactical bombing campaign in history  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-13  as the Americans used massed air power to try and break the siege.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-14  The North Vietnamese meant their attack on Khe Sanh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-15  ...to deliver an historic victory that would destroy...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-16  ...the will of the United States to carry on the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-17  In fact, in spite of immense sacrifice  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-18  ...the North Vietnamese Army would fail.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-19  After Khe Sanh the NVA would never again...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-20  ...take on the Americans in a set piece battle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-21  PRELUDE TO THE BATTLE  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-22  In March 19653,500 U.S. Marines...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-23  ...had been the first American combat troops sent to South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-24  Their orders were to defend an airbase at Da Nang  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-25  but their mission didn't stay defensive for long.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-26  In spite of years of U.S. backing, South Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-27  ...was close to losing its war against communist Vietcong guerrillas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-28  By July 1965 Washington had decided to commit 200,000 US troops to the fight...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-29  and the Marines had gone on the offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-30  American commanders saw their role as taking on...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-31  ...the Vietcong's big units: the battalions and regiments.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-32  The units were well trained...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-33  ...and had been armed with modern weapons by North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-34  Increasingly the NLF's war was controlled from the North  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-35  and North Vietnam had already begun to send its own troops  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-36  ...to fight alongside the guerrillas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-37  The first big battle between the Americans and the Vietcong...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-38  ...was in August 1965.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-39  In operation Starlite the Marines smashed a Vietcong regiment.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-40  In November in the Ia Drang valley, the 1st Air Cavalry Division...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-41  ...battled almost 6,000 North Vietnamese Army troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-42  According to General Westmoreland  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-43  the Americans killed more than 1,200 in a storm of heavy fire.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-44  American commanders were buoyed up...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-45  ...by their apparent success on the battlefield.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-46  More such victories would quickly force the Vietcong to give up their campaign.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-47  The optimism did not last long.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-48  By the close of 1965 the Americans were finding it impossible...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-49  ...to make the Vietcong fight pitch battles.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-50  Meantime U.S. casualties were rising fast...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-51  from ambushes, booby traps and surprise attacks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-52  By the start of 1966, Military Assistance Command, known as MACV  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-53  the main American headquarters in South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-54  deployed 184,000 U.S. troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-55  Army units were concentrated in the Saigon area  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-56  in a strip along the central coast and in the Central Highlands.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-57  The Marines of the III Marine Amphibious Force were further North  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-58  in the area known as I Corps.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-59  I Corps bordered the Demilitarized Zone...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-60  ...separating North and South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-61  The Marines now had three main bases in I Corps  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-62  at Da Nang, Chu Lai and Phu Bai  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-63  while the South Vietnamese Army had headquarters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-64  ...at Hue and Quang Ngai.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-65  The threat came from NLF battalions in the countryside and the border areas  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-66  the North Vietnamese Army on the Demilitarized Zone...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-67  and from tens of thousands of local NLF...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-68  ...inside the heavily populated coastal belt.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-69  To the NLF the coastal villages were a priceless asset.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-70  They produced vast quantities of rice...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-71  ...which could feed the big guerrilla units in the remote interior.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-72  They also produced large numbers of recruits.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-73  Over the years the NLF had gained control of thousands of villages.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-74  They had created their own local administration and village guerrilla forces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-75  The villages also played host to the big units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-76  ...as they passed through on operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-77  All the areas in which the American Marines had built their bases...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-78  ...were surrounded by NLF controlled villages.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-79  Marine sweeps through the settlements rarely managed to find them.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-80  Vietcong tactics were to pull out the main guerrilla forces and officials...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-81  leaving only snipers and booby traps behind.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-82  After the Marines had moved on the fighters would quickly return.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-83  For the Americans it was deeply frustrating.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-84  The Marines were forced to think again about how...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-85  ...they could fight this new and unsettling kind of war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-86  The answer the Marines came up with was a pacification program.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-87  The idea was to fight the NLF for control of the villages...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-88  ...and to do it around the clock.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-89  Squad and company sized units patrolled vigorously...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-90  ...and mounted constant ambushes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-91  The rice harvest was protected to keep it out of Vietcong hands.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-92  In areas that stayed hostile...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-93  ...whole villages were moved by force to districts already pacified.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-94  The Marines' aggressive military tactics were combined with persuasion.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-95  In civic action projects, widely known as the 'Hearts and Minds' program  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-96  villagers were given medical aid and help with economic development.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-97  The Marines claimed the policy was highly successful...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-98  ...and helped bring more than a million people under government control  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-99  however, in reality it was just an illusion and the NLF still managed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-100  ...to infiltrate these areas which continued to abound with sympathizers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-101  The change came in mid 1966.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-102  General Westmoreland, the commander of US forces in South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-103  had never agreed with the Marines' methods.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-104  He believed that controlling villages was a waste...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-105  ...of highly trained and heavily armed troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-106  Westmoreland argued that the Marines should instead...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-107  ...be used to pursue the enemy's big units in the remote interior.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-108  In fact events would soon force the Marines...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-109  ...to reduce their whole pacification effort.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-110  Civil unrest erupted between...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-111  ...South Vietnamese factions right across the country.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-112  The North saw its opportunity and assembled thousands of troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-113  ...poised to cross into the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-114  It was a threat the Marines could not ignore.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-115  The North Vietnamese Army's 324B Division crossed the Demilitarized Zone...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-116  ...in late May 1966 and encountered a Marine battalion.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-117  The NVA held their ground and the largest battle of the war to date...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-118  ...broke out near Dong Ha.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-119  General Walt moved most of the 3rd Marine division North  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-120  5,000 men in five battalions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-121  In Operation Hastings, the Marines backed by South Vietnamese Army troops  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-122  the heavy guns of US warships  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-123  and the Marines' own artillery and air power...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-124  drove the NVA back over the Demilitarized Zone...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-125  ...in just over three weeks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-126  Because the Marines were forbidden...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-127  to cross the Demilitarized Zone into North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-128  the 324B division, along with elements of two more divisions  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-129  were able to regroup and return to the South almost at once.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-130  The Marines were forced to mount Operation Prairie which tied up 11 battalions  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-131  ...nearly 10,000 troops for a full ten months.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-132  To support the operations they and Special Forces' units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-133  ...built a string of combat bases stretching from Gio Linh in the East...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-134  ...to Khe Sanh in the West.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-135  Casualties on both sides were heavy in Operations Hastings and Prairie.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-136  Although over 300 Americans were dead and nearly 1,500 wounded  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-137  it was a victory for the Americans.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-138  However, the NVA divisions had not been beaten.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-139  They simply slipped back across the Demilitarized Zone...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-140  ...from where they could return at any time.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-141  The Marines now had little choice...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-142  ...but to keep strong forces in the area.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-143  As the Americans had expected, in the first months of 1967  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-144  North Vietnamese Army units once more began infiltrating into the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-145  The Marines' reaction was to mount big operations...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-146  ...to find them and cut them off.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-147  Both sides were determined to control the hill tops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-148  ...dominating the valley trails.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-149  The bloodiest battles of all were those fought for the hills...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-150  ...surrounding the Marine combat base at Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-151  These were 881 North and South and hill 861  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-152  thus named for their height in feet.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-153  American bases below the Demilitarized Zone were strung out...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-154  ...along route 1 and route 9.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-155  The command center was Dong Ha while Camp Carrol and The Rockpile...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-156  ...were artillery bases with long range heavy guns.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-157  On the Western end of route 9 Lang Vei, a Special Forces camp...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-158  ...and the Marine base at Khe Sanh were particularly important.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-159  They dominated North Vietnamese infiltration routes into the South...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-160  ...from the Demilitarized Zone and from Laos.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-161  Khe Sanh combat base sat astride the valley of the Rao Quang river  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-162  ...with Dong Tri mountain to the North...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-163  ...and a series of smaller numbered hills to the North West.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-164  In April 1967, elements of the NVA 325C Division...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-165  ...moved onto hills 881 North and South and hill 861  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-166  ...and stormed the signal relay station atop hill 950.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-167  They built fortifications and placed artillery...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-168  ...to support the main effort, an infantry assault...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-169  ...by all three of the division's regiments, more than 5,000 men.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-170  The base at Khe Sanh had been defended by only a single company of Marines  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-171  but now American strength was raised to two battalions with more artillery.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-172  By May 5th, after violent battles  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-173  ...the Marines had seized all three key hills.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-174  The battered North Vietnamese division pulled back...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-175  ...over the Demilitarized Zone and across the Laotian border.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-176  After the hill fights at Khe Sanh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-177  ...the war on the Demilitarized Zone shifted to the Eastern sector.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-178  North Vietnamese Artillery hidden inside the zone...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-179  ...hammered Marine bases causing heavy casualties.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-180  30,000 NVA troops tried to infiltrate past the American outposts.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-181  In July 1967, there was heavy fighting near Conh Tien...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-182  ...killing 1,300 NVA troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-183  During the last months of 1967  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-184  the Marines launched one operation after another...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-185  ...to try and intercept infiltrating NVA forces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-186  It was no easy task.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-187  The terrain was rough  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-188  there were never enough helicopters  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-189  and poor weather often shut down air operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-190  Meanwhile, powerful NVA units were once again massing...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-191  ...in the hills and forests around the Khe Sanh combat base.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-192  THE LEADERS – North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-193  Since the start of the conflict, North Vietnamese leaders  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-194  had been arguing bitterly about how best to win the war in the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-195  The president, Ho Chi Minh was by now aging and in poor health  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-196  ...but he still had enormous influence.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-197  Ho was revered by millions of Vietnamese North and South  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-198  and any big decisions had to be approved by him.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-199  For the last two years Ho had supported a cautious approach...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-200  ...to fighting the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-201  But in mid 1967, he backed a new strategy...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-202  ...pushed by powerful figures within the politburo including Le Duan  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-203  ...the General Secretary of the communist party.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-204  The plan was to mount an all out offensive...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-205  ...against the cities and towns of the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-206  The NLF guerrillas inside South Vietnam would launch most of the attacks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-207  But General Giap North Vietnam's defense minister  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-208  planned to add a distinctive touch of his own.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-209  He meant to pit North Vietnamese Army troops directly  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-210  against the Americans at Khe Sanh in a major set piece battle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-211  He would even direct the attacking forces himself.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-212  THE LEADERS – United States  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-213  Throughout 1967 the U.S. President, Lyndon Johnson  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-214  had been under pressure from his military advisors...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-215  ...to intensify the war in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-216  The Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted the president to ease...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-217  ...the many restrictions on the bombing campaign against the North.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-218  They also wanted ground attacks against the enemy sanctuaries...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-219  ...in Laos and Cambodia perhaps even into North Vietnam itself.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-220  Without such measures, they could see no prospect of victory soon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-221  President Johnson's fear was that expanding the ground campaign...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-222  ...might draw China or the Soviet Union into the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-223  He also faced problems at home.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-224  The Anti-War movement was already growing, and a wider conflict  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-225  might turn the American people completely against the whole effort.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-226  The last thing the president wanted to hear...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-227  ...was that the communists were preparing for a major offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-228  But General Westmoreland the commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-229  was warning that a large scale attack might be on the way.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-230  Westmoreland believed that the North Vietnamese Army...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-231  ...was preparing a big push into the South  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-232  and that its first target might be the Marine combat base at Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-233  Although the president and his advisors were deeply worried by the news  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-234  Westmoreland himself was optimistic.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-235  He believed he had the forces to deal with any threat  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-236  and a massive enemy offensive might be the opportunity he'd been waiting for.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-237  If the North Vietnamese Army came out into the open to fight pitch battles  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-238  there was a real chance of a decisive American victory.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-239  STRATEGY – North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-240  For the North Vietnamese Army and its commander General Giap  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-241  attacking the Americans at Khe Sanh promised a whole series of benefits.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-242  The build up would draw American attention...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-243  ...away from the Southern cities the main targets of the Tet offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-244  A successful attack would also open a clear route into South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-245  A victory at Khe Sanh might also bring another even more valuable price:  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-246  The U.S. Marines defending the base were an elite force  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-247  ...and crushing them might damage American morale beyond repair.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-248  In 1954, 13 years previously, General Giap had inflicted...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-249  just such a defeat on French colonial forces at Dien Bien Phu.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-250  In selecting Khe Sanh as the site for a set piece battle with the Americans  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-251  General Giap had chosen carefully.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-252  The jungle covered hills and low cloud combined with heavy fog...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-253  ...would work against American air power  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-254  And while his own troops were close to supplies and reinforcements  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-255  the Americans could be cut off from any outside help.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-256  The weakened garrison would then be overrun.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-257  From March 1967, the Americans had succeeded in sending...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-258  ...heavily armed convoys down route 9 to Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-259  However, in July, an attempt to get long range artillery to the combat base...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-260  ...was blocked by North Vietnamese Ambushes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-261  Soon the NVA had closed the road completely...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-262  ...and the first phase of the campaign against Khe Sanh was completed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-263  The next stage in the North Vietnamese plan...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-264  ...was to deploy infantry North and West of Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-265  The units to the North would capture the hills overlooking the base...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-266  and place artillery to bombard the Americans and destroy their airfield.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-267  They would also mount ground attacks to create a diversion.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-268  The Western units would capture Lang Vei Special Forces camp...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-269  ...and Khe Sanh village and then mount a massive assault...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-270  ...to take the Marine combat base from the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-271  A vital ingredient of General Giap's plan was to soften up Khe Sanh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-272  ...and its surrounding hill outposts with massive artillery bombardments.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-273  It was vital to prevent American aircraft from finding and destroying...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-274  ...the guns, mortars and rocket batteries before the attack.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-275  The troops made enormous efforts to protect the artillery...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-276  by hiding it in caves or specially dug pits.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-277  They sited huge numbers of anti aircraft guns to drive away...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-278  ...inquisitive reconnaissance planes...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-279  ...while everything was hidden by elaborate camouflage  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-280  STRATEGY – United States  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-281  From the start of the war in Vietnam, U.S. Military commanders...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-282  ...had believed that the best form of defense was to attack in strength.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-283  When reconnaissance detected a large enemy force  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-284  U.S. troops would be helicoptered in to surround and destroy it.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-285  Although often they flew straight into an ambush  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-286  in the main, the strategy worked.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-287  The problem with the American tactics was that they needed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-288  ever increasing numbers of troops and helicopters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-289  In Washington, Robert McNamara, the secretary of defense  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-290  worried that the constant demand for more men...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-291  ...would eventually destroy public support for the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-292  Throughout 1967 McNamara had pushed for a strategy...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-293  ...that would reduce the need for manpower.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-294  One proposal in particular McNamara adopted enthusiastically.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-295  The idea was to clear a line along the Demilitarized Zone...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-296  and build an electronic barrier to stop enemy infiltration from North to South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-297  The plan, called the “Strong Point Obstacle System”  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-298  was expected to cost a billion dollars.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-299  To U.S. troops on the ground, it made no sense.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-300  They christened it McNamara's Line.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-301  Because the Eastern part of the Demilitarized Zone was flat ground  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-302  the area was given the first priority for defense.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-303  The plan was for nine strong points including Con Thien and Gio Linh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-304  ...linked by fencing, mine fields and electronic detectors.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-305  West to Khe Sanh, U.S. Bases would act as anchors for short strips of line  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-306  ...blocking all the likely approaches.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-307  Artillery would cover the whole area.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-308  By the end of 1967, the Eastern part of the Strong Point Obstacle System...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-309  ...was almost complete.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-310  American planners hoped the new defense would at least channel...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-311  ...the North Vietnamese into the more difficult hilly terrain...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-312  ...guarded by the Rockpile and Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-313  In the future, when those bases too were part of the system  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-314  military commanders saw them playing a particularly important role:  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-315  If full scale ground operations were ever launched into Laos  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-316  the barrier would protect Americans from flank attacks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-317  The Strong Point Obstacle System was deeply unwelcome to U.S. commanders in the area.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-318  Building just the Eastern part imposed a heavy burden on the Marines.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-319  The line was soaking up vast amounts of material and manpower  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-320  ...restricting offensive operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-321  Worst of all, the construction work and the transport supplying it...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-322  ...were sitting targets for North Vietnamese gunners.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-323  THE OPPOSING FORCES – North Vietnamese Army  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-324  Altogether the North Vietnamese Army numbered just under 470,000 troops  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-325  in 12 divisions and 100 independent regiments.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-326  There was also a small navy for coastal patrol, and an air force...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-327  to defend against American bombing raids  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-328  together with an air defense missile force.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-329  China had also committed 50,000 advisors and engineers to repair damage...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-330  ...done by American bombing and so free North Vietnamese troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-331  ...for combat operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-332  By now, the NVA had taken over all military activity...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-333  ...in the northernmost parts of South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-334  ...and 102,000 NVA troops were available to fight in the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-335  All the same, the planned Tet offensive was not meant...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-336  ...to depend heavily on the Northern Army.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-337  The Southern guerrillas, the Vietcong would do most of the fighting.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-338  And just over a quarter of NVA units in the South...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-339  ...were to be committed to Tet  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-340  the rest would either be held back as a reserve...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-341  ...or thrown into the battle against the Americans at Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-342  By the start of 1968 the North Vietnamese Army...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-343  ...had more than 40,000 men positioned near the border with South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-344  One division was to launch attacks down the East coast...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-345  ...to take Da Nang and other important centers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-346  Four divisions and two regiments were massed for the assault on Khe Sanh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-347  ...and for follow up operations to seize the northern provinces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-348  North of Khe Sanh was the 325C division with three regiments and a battalion.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-349  The elite 304th Division was South of the base.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-350  The besieging forces were supported by three artillery formations...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-351  and anti aircraft units while a regiment handled resupply from the North.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-352  Further East another division was placed to threaten...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-353  the American artillery base at the Rockpile  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-354  to keep route 9 cut and to act as reinforcements.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-355  A small number of tanks were also positioned west of Lang Vei.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-356  If the battle for Khe Sanh was to end in victory  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-357  General Giap and his planners knew...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-358  ...that an uninterrupted flow of supplies would be the key.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-359  The experience in 1954 of fighting the French at Dien Bien Phu  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-360  ...had taught him the value of ensuring continuous supply...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-361  ...long before the final storming of the enemy base.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-362  He was determined to repeat his achievement at Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-363  To get ammunition, food and materials to the forces attacking Khe Sanh  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-364  Giap ordered the building of two new roads.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-365  They were soon detected by the Americans who named them “The Santa Fe trail”.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-366  U.S. fighter bombers made furious attacks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-367  but the roads were impossible to destroy or even damage seriously.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-368  The Santa Fe trail was heavily camouflaged and fully equipped...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-369  ...with bunkers, storage depots and way-stations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-370  The roads were protected by heavy anti aircraft cover.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-371  Already supplies had been built up near Khe Sanh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-372  ...for between 60 and 90 days of sustained combat.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-373  WEAPONS – North Vietnamese Army  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-374  For more than a decade the North Vietnamese Army...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-375  ...had been getting military equipment from China and the Soviet Union.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-376  The best NVA divisions were extremely well armed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-377  The rugged and effective AK-47 assault rifle was perfect...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-378  ...for the harsh battlefield conditions of Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-379  Infantry units had large numbers of machine guns...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-380  ...and RPG-7 anti tank grenade launchers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-381  The main defense against American air power for the troops around Khe Sanh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-382  ...was the Soviet K-38 heavy machine gun.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-383  Near special installations the NVA anti aircraft units were armed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-384  ...with 37 mm anti aircraft cannons...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-385  ...a menace even to the fastest American jets.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-386  The heavy artillery which NVA gunners would use to try and overwhelm...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-387  ...the defenses of the Khe Sanh base was also Soviet and Chinese.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-388  The 130 mm field gun had a range of 19 miles  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-389  ...further than any comparable American gun.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-390  U.S. troops rated it the best all-round artillery piece on the Vietnam battlefield.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-391  The guns would be reinforced by huge numbers of rockets and heavy mortars.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-392  THE TROOPS - North Vietnamese Army  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-393  The troops of the North Vietnamese Army were recognized...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-394  ...even by their American enemies as first class soldiers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-395  They were extremely well trained and disciplined.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-396  They were skilled in tactics and their morale and determination...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-397  ...often seemed to the Americans to border on the fanatical.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-398  In fact, during 1967, as losses soared  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-399  North Vietnamese Army morale had slumped badly.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-400  Desertion threatened to become a real problem.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-401  The grueling track from home bases to distant Khe Sanh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-402  ...had also taken its toll.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-403  American bombing was a constant danger, and diseases  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-404  ...particularly malaria, were rife.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-405  Most of the NVA soldiers who were massing to attack Khe Sanh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-406  ...were from the coastal lowlands of North Vietnam and found life a misery...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-407  in the sodden, insect infested jungles, as did their enemy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-408  In preparation for the Khe Sanh battle...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-409  NVA commanders went to enormous lengths to restore their troops' morale.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-410  Cultural groups were sent on the long and arduous journey...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-411  ...to the front to entertain the troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-412  The message was simple  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-413  and was reinforced at every opportunity by political officers:  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-414  The coming campaign would deliver the victory...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-415  ...they had hoped for for so many years.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-416  The propaganda effort worked well.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-417  In the final weeks before the offensive...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-418  ...desertions from the North Vietnamese Army fell dramatically.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-419  THE OPPOSING FORCES – United States  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-420  In late 1967, 73,000 of the almost half a million American troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-421  ...in South Vietnam were United States Marines.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-422  They were under the command of the U.S. Navy Pacific Fleet Headquarters in Honolulu  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-423  but operational control was with General Westmoreland's...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-424  ...Military Assistance Command in Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-425  From the start, the independent status of the Marines had led to friction.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-426  Often they were accused by the Army and the Air Force...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-427  ...of fighting their own private war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-428  Since Lieutenant General Robert Cushman had taken over...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-429  ...as Marine commander in June 1967  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-430  he and Westmoreland had argued continuously...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-431  ...over how the Marines should best be used.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-432  The latest issue was the McNamara Line.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-433  The idea was strongly opposed by the Marines  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-434  ...but Westmoreland had become a strong supporter.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-435  There was also a major disagreement brewing over...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-436  ...who should control Marine air power.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-437  On the eve of a major battle...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-438  inter-service rivalry was threatening to grow into a serious problem.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-439  All American units in I Corps were commanded by the III Marine Amphibious Force...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-440  ...with its headquarters at Da Nang.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-441  The force controlled the 1st and 3rd Marine Divisions  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-442  and elements of the 5th along with the 23rd Army division  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-443  two army brigades and a squadron of Armored Cavalry.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-444  The South Vietnamese Army deployed two divisions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-445  ...and an infantry regiment in I Corps  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-446  and there was also a brigade of Korean Marines.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-447  Air support for operations in I Corps was provided...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-448  ...by a U.S. Air Force tactical fighter wing  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-449  the 1st Marine air wing  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-450  and a South Vietnamese Air Force squadron.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-451  U.S. Navy aircraft were stationed on the carriers of Task Force 77  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-452  while three wings of B-52 bombers were also on call...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-453  ...from Thailand and Guam in the Pacific Ocean.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-454  Air Supply was carried out by Marine and Air Force...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-455  ...transport and helicopter squadrons.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-456  As more than a 100,000 men, half of all US combat units in South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-457  ...had been concentrated in I Corps  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-458  ...the supply system had been strained to the limit.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-459  On the DMZ alone ammunition consumption was running...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-460  ...at 25,000 artillery shells a month.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-461  The Marine's supply line stretched from the United States...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-462  ...to Okinawa in the Pacific and on into Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-463  The U.S. Forces required 21,000 tons of food  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-464  ...ammunition, fuel and general supplies daily.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-465  As a result there was a constant stream of ships...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-466  ...and air freight into Da Nang.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-467  Getting the supplies to where they were needed was a massive job.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-468  Vietnam was the first war to see computers used to control supplies.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-469  The requisitioning system handled over 80,000 different items...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-470  ...from boots for the men to spares for helicopters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-471  WEAPONS – U.S. Marines  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-472  Just like their North Vietnamese enemies...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-473  ...the Marine infantry would depend in the coming battles on supporting firepower.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-474  They had large numbers of medium and heavy mortars.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-475  The Marines would also make good use of 106 mm recoilless rifles.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-476  The M-40 had been designed as an anti tank weapon  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-477  but it was also highly effective against bunkers and trenches.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-478  Marine bases always had their own standard 105 mm artillery pieces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-479  The guns had a range of 7 miles.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-480  Some bases, including Khe Sanh also had powerful 155 mm Howitzers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-481  They could lob a heavy shell over 9 miles at a rate of 4 rounds a minute.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-482  The base could also call in supporting fire...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-483  ...from the Army's huge 175mm self propelled guns.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-484  These weapons could fire a 170 pound shell 23 miles  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-485  just enough to reach the Khe Sanh area from the Rockpile or Camp Carroll.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-486  Support from aircraft was much less reliable than artillery.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-487  Air operations could be shut down completely by bad weather.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-488  But in the right conditions fighter bombers could bring...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-489  ...devastating fire power to the battlefield.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-490  A-4 SkyHawks operating from carriers in the Tonkin gulf...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-491  ...or from Marine airfields could be over the Khe Sanh area...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-492  ...in less than 30 minutes with a ton and a half of bombs.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-493  Navy, Marine and Air Force Phantoms were also on call.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-494  Although designed as an interceptor, the F-4 was a powerful bomber.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-495  It could carry 18 750 pound bombs...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-496  or 11 canisters of the devastating flammable gel NAPALM.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-497  THE TROOPS – U.S. Marines  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-498  As an elite formation which could attract recruits of the highest quality  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-499  the United States Marines had for years been an all volunteer force.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-500  Vietnam had forced to change.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-501  Restricting tours of duty to 13 months and a steady accumulation of casualties  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-502  meant the Marine corps had to take in draftees.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-503  Around 20,000 men had been drafted in by the end of 1967.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-504  Basic training had been cut too, down from 12 to 8 weeks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-505  There was also a severe shortage of skilled personnel...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-506  ...particularly helicopter pilots.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-507  In spite of the sometimes appalling conditions of cold, wet and dirt  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-508  in which the Marines in Vietnam had to live and fight  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-509  the morale had stood up well.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-510  Marine discipline and the sense of being part of an elite helped.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-511  So did the knowledge that support from artillery  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-512  helicopter gunship or strike aircraft was not far away.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-513  But nothing helped the morale of the men...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-514  as much as the superb medical evacuation and treatment system.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-515  After emergency treatment by a medic on the spot  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-516  a wounded man could expect to be picked up by a med-evac helicopter  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-517  ...in less than half an hour.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-518  The crews of evacuation helicopters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-519  ...were among the most admired troops serving in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-520  The pilots would go to extraordinary lengths to get wounded men away...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-521  ...even under heavy fire.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-522  In I Corps evacuation was to one of three field hospitals...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-523  ...or to the main hospital at Da Nang.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-524  There were also two fully equipped Navy hospital ships...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-525  ...each with more than 500 beds.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-526  So effective was the Marine med-evac system...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-527  that 99% of evacuated Marines survived their wounds.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-528  EVE OF BATTLE  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-529  As evidence had mounted that the North Vietnamese...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-530  ...were going to attack Khe Sanh  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-531  the Americans took a quick decision to reinforce the base.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-532  By the close of 1967 the third battalion of the 26th Marines  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-533  ...had arrived to boost the garrison.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-534  New bunkers, quarters, and perimeter defenses had to be built fast.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-535  Building materials that were meant for the McNamara Line...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-536  ...were quickly diverted to Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-537  Only days after the new Marine unit had arrived to Khe Sanh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-538  it launched a major Search and Destroy operation towards the border with Laos.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-539  The Marines discovered North Vietnamese weapons caches and fresh trails  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-540  but not a single enemy soldier opened fire.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-541  Unknown to the Americans the 30,000 NVA troops all around...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-542  ...were under strict orders to avoid all contact.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-543  Christmas 1967 came and went on the Demilitarized Zone  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-544  but the North Vietnamese stayed uncannily quiet.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-545  However, there were signs of intense NVA reconnaissance around Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-546  Most Marines now believed the question was not...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN07-547  ...whether the North Vietnamese meant to storm Khe Sanh but when.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-1  BATTLEFIELD VIETNAM  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-2  War on the DMZ  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-3  In early 1968, United States Marines fought the North Vietnamese Army...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-4  in one of the most bitterly contested battles of the Vietnam War.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-5  For 77 days 20,000 NVA troops laid siege...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-6  ...to the Marine combat base at Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-7  At stake was the control of the gateway to South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-8  The siege of Khe Sanh was the longest single battle of the Vietnam War.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-9  It was also one of the most violent.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-10  There were savage artillery duels  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-11  mass infantry assaults and fierce hand to hand combat.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-12  Khe Sanh also saw the most concentrated tactical bombing campaign in history  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-13  as the Americans used massed air power to try and break the siege.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-14  The North Vietnamese meant their attack on Khe Sanh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-15  ...to deliver an historic victory that would destroy...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-16  ...the will of the United States to carry on the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-17  In fact, in spite of immense sacrifice  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-18  ...the North Vietnamese Army would fail.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-19  After Khe Sanh the NVA would never again...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-20  ...take on the Americans in a set piece battle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-21  PRELUDE TO THE BATTLE  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-22  In March 19653,500 U.S. Marines...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-23  ...had been the first American combat troops sent to South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-24  Their orders were to defend an airbase at Da Nang  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-25  but their mission didn't stay defensive for long.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-26  In spite of years of U.S. backing, South Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-27  ...was close to losing its war against communist Vietcong guerrillas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-28  By July 1965 Washington had decided to commit 200,000 US troops to the fight...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-29  and the Marines had gone on the offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-30  American commanders saw their role as taking on...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-31  ...the Vietcong's big units: the battalions and regiments.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-32  The units were well trained...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-33  ...and had been armed with modern weapons by North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-34  Increasingly the NLF's war was controlled from the North  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-35  and North Vietnam had already begun to send its own troops  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-36  ...to fight alongside the guerrillas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-37  The first big battle between the Americans and the Vietcong...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-38  ...was in August 1965.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-39  In operation Starlite the Marines smashed a Vietcong regiment.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-40  In November in the Ia Drang valley, the 1st Air Cavalry Division...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-41  ...battled almost 6,000 North Vietnamese Army troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-42  According to General Westmoreland  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-43  the Americans killed more than 1,200 in a storm of heavy fire.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-44  American commanders were buoyed up...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-45  ...by their apparent success on the battlefield.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-46  More such victories would quickly force the Vietcong to give up their campaign.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-47  The optimism did not last long.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-48  By the close of 1965 the Americans were finding it impossible...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-49  ...to make the Vietcong fight pitch battles.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-50  Meantime U.S. casualties were rising fast...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-51  from ambushes, booby traps and surprise attacks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-52  By the start of 1966, Military Assistance Command, known as MACV  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-53  the main American headquarters in South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-54  deployed 184,000 U.S. troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-55  Army units were concentrated in the Saigon area  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-56  in a strip along the central coast and in the Central Highlands.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-57  The Marines of the III Marine Amphibious Force were further North  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-58  in the area known as I Corps.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-59  I Corps bordered the Demilitarized Zone...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-60  ...separating North and South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-61  The Marines now had three main bases in I Corps  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-62  at Da Nang, Chu Lai and Phu Bai  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-63  while the South Vietnamese Army had headquarters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-64  ...at Hue and Quang Ngai.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-65  The threat came from NLF battalions in the countryside and the border areas  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-66  the North Vietnamese Army on the Demilitarized Zone...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-67  and from tens of thousands of local NLF...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-68  ...inside the heavily populated coastal belt.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-69  To the NLF the coastal villages were a priceless asset.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-70  They produced vast quantities of rice...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-71  ...which could feed the big guerrilla units in the remote interior.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-72  They also produced large numbers of recruits.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-73  Over the years the NLF had gained control of thousands of villages.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-74  They had created their own local administration and village guerrilla forces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-75  The villages also played host to the big units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-76  ...as they passed through on operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-77  All the areas in which the American Marines had built their bases...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-78  ...were surrounded by NLF controlled villages.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-79  Marine sweeps through the settlements rarely managed to find them.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-80  Vietcong tactics were to pull out the main guerrilla forces and officials...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-81  leaving only snipers and booby traps behind.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-82  After the Marines had moved on the fighters would quickly return.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-83  For the Americans it was deeply frustrating.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-84  The Marines were forced to think again about how...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-85  ...they could fight this new and unsettling kind of war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-86  The answer the Marines came up with was a pacification program.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-87  The idea was to fight the NLF for control of the villages...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-88  ...and to do it around the clock.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-89  Squad and company sized units patrolled vigorously...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-90  ...and mounted constant ambushes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-91  The rice harvest was protected to keep it out of Vietcong hands.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-92  In areas that stayed hostile...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-93  ...whole villages were moved by force to districts already pacified.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-94  The Marines' aggressive military tactics were combined with persuasion.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-95  In civic action projects, widely known as the 'Hearts and Minds' program  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-96  villagers were given medical aid and help with economic development.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-97  The Marines claimed the policy was highly successful...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-98  ...and helped bring more than a million people under government control  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-99  however, in reality it was just an illusion and the NLF still managed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-100  ...to infiltrate these areas which continued to abound with sympathizers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-101  The change came in mid 1966.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-102  General Westmoreland, the commander of US forces in South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-103  had never agreed with the Marines' methods.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-104  He believed that controlling villages was a waste...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-105  ...of highly trained and heavily armed troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-106  Westmoreland argued that the Marines should instead...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-107  ...be used to pursue the enemy's big units in the remote interior.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-108  In fact events would soon force the Marines...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-109  ...to reduce their whole pacification effort.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-110  Civil unrest erupted between...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-111  ...South Vietnamese factions right across the country.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-112  The North saw its opportunity and assembled thousands of troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-113  ...poised to cross into the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-114  It was a threat the Marines could not ignore.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-115  The North Vietnamese Army's 324B Division crossed the Demilitarized Zone...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-116  ...in late May 1966 and encountered a Marine battalion.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-117  The NVA held their ground and the largest battle of the war to date...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-118  ...broke out near Dong Ha.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-119  General Walt moved most of the 3rd Marine division North  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-120  5,000 men in five battalions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-121  In Operation Hastings, the Marines backed by South Vietnamese Army troops  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-122  the heavy guns of US warships  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-123  and the Marines' own artillery and air power...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-124  drove the NVA back over the Demilitarized Zone...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-125  ...in just over three weeks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-126  Because the Marines were forbidden...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-127  to cross the Demilitarized Zone into North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-128  the 324B division, along with elements of two more divisions  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-129  were able to regroup and return to the South almost at once.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-130  The Marines were forced to mount Operation Prairie which tied up 11 battalions  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-131  ...nearly 10,000 troops for a full ten months.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-132  To support the operations they and Special Forces' units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-133  ...built a string of combat bases stretching from Gio Linh in the East...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-134  ...to Khe Sanh in the West.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-135  Casualties on both sides were heavy in Operations Hastings and Prairie.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-136  Although over 300 Americans were dead and nearly 1,500 wounded  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-137  it was a victory for the Americans.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-138  However, the NVA divisions had not been beaten.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-139  They simply slipped back across the Demilitarized Zone...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-140  ...from where they could return at any time.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-141  The Marines now had little choice...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-142  ...but to keep strong forces in the area.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-143  As the Americans had expected, in the first months of 1967  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-144  North Vietnamese Army units once more began infiltrating into the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-145  The Marines' reaction was to mount big operations...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-146  ...to find them and cut them off.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-147  Both sides were determined to control the hill tops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-148  ...dominating the valley trails.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-149  The bloodiest battles of all were those fought for the hills...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-150  ...surrounding the Marine combat base at Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-151  These were 881 North and South and hill 861  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-152  thus named for their height in feet.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-153  American bases below the Demilitarized Zone were strung out...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-154  ...along route 1 and route 9.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-155  The command center was Dong Ha while Camp Carrol and The Rockpile...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-156  ...were artillery bases with long range heavy guns.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-157  On the Western end of route 9 Lang Vei, a Special Forces camp...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-158  ...and the Marine base at Khe Sanh were particularly important.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-159  They dominated North Vietnamese infiltration routes into the South...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-160  ...from the Demilitarized Zone and from Laos.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-161  Khe Sanh combat base sat astride the valley of the Rao Quang river  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-162  ...with Dong Tri mountain to the North...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-163  ...and a series of smaller numbered hills to the North West.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-164  In April 1967, elements of the NVA 325C Division...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-165  ...moved onto hills 881 North and South and hill 861  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-166  ...and stormed the signal relay station atop hill 950.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-167  They built fortifications and placed artillery...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-168  ...to support the main effort, an infantry assault...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-169  ...by all three of the division's regiments, more than 5,000 men.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-170  The base at Khe Sanh had been defended by only a single company of Marines  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-171  but now American strength was raised to two battalions with more artillery.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-172  By May 5th, after violent battles  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-173  ...the Marines had seized all three key hills.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-174  The battered North Vietnamese division pulled back...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-175  ...over the Demilitarized Zone and across the Laotian border.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-176  After the hill fights at Khe Sanh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-177  ...the war on the Demilitarized Zone shifted to the Eastern sector.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-178  North Vietnamese Artillery hidden inside the zone...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-179  ...hammered Marine bases causing heavy casualties.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-180  30,000 NVA troops tried to infiltrate past the American outposts.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-181  In July 1967, there was heavy fighting near Conh Tien...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-182  ...killing 1,300 NVA troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-183  During the last months of 1967  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-184  the Marines launched one operation after another...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-185  ...to try and intercept infiltrating NVA forces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-186  It was no easy task.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-187  The terrain was rough  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-188  there were never enough helicopters  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-189  and poor weather often shut down air operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-190  Meanwhile, powerful NVA units were once again massing...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-191  ...in the hills and forests around the Khe Sanh combat base.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-192  THE LEADERS – North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-193  Since the start of the conflict, North Vietnamese leaders  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-194  had been arguing bitterly about how best to win the war in the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-195  The president, Ho Chi Minh was by now aging and in poor health  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-196  ...but he still had enormous influence.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-197  Ho was revered by millions of Vietnamese North and South  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-198  and any big decisions had to be approved by him.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-199  For the last two years Ho had supported a cautious approach...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-200  ...to fighting the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-201  But in mid 1967, he backed a new strategy...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-202  ...pushed by powerful figures within the politburo including Le Duan  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-203  ...the General Secretary of the communist party.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-204  The plan was to mount an all out offensive...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-205  ...against the cities and towns of the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-206  The NLF guerrillas inside South Vietnam would launch most of the attacks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-207  But General Giap North Vietnam's defense minister  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-208  planned to add a distinctive touch of his own.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-209  He meant to pit North Vietnamese Army troops directly  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-210  against the Americans at Khe Sanh in a major set piece battle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-211  He would even direct the attacking forces himself.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-212  THE LEADERS – United States  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-213  Throughout 1967 the U.S. President, Lyndon Johnson  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-214  had been under pressure from his military advisors...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-215  ...to intensify the war in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-216  The Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted the president to ease...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-217  ...the many restrictions on the bombing campaign against the North.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-218  They also wanted ground attacks against the enemy sanctuaries...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-219  ...in Laos and Cambodia perhaps even into North Vietnam itself.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-220  Without such measures, they could see no prospect of victory soon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-221  President Johnson's fear was that expanding the ground campaign...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-222  ...might draw China or the Soviet Union into the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-223  He also faced problems at home.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-224  The Anti-War movement was already growing, and a wider conflict  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-225  might turn the American people completely against the whole effort.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-226  The last thing the president wanted to hear...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-227  ...was that the communists were preparing for a major offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-228  But General Westmoreland the commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-229  was warning that a large scale attack might be on the way.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-230  Westmoreland believed that the North Vietnamese Army...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-231  ...was preparing a big push into the South  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-232  and that its first target might be the Marine combat base at Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-233  Although the president and his advisors were deeply worried by the news  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-234  Westmoreland himself was optimistic.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-235  He believed he had the forces to deal with any threat  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-236  and a massive enemy offensive might be the opportunity he'd been waiting for.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-237  If the North Vietnamese Army came out into the open to fight pitch battles  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-238  there was a real chance of a decisive American victory.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-239  STRATEGY – North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-240  For the North Vietnamese Army and its commander General Giap  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-241  attacking the Americans at Khe Sanh promised a whole series of benefits.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-242  The build up would draw American attention...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-243  ...away from the Southern cities the main targets of the Tet offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-244  A successful attack would also open a clear route into South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-245  A victory at Khe Sanh might also bring another even more valuable price:  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-246  The U.S. Marines defending the base were an elite force  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-247  ...and crushing them might damage American morale beyond repair.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-248  In 1954, 13 years previously, General Giap had inflicted...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-249  just such a defeat on French colonial forces at Dien Bien Phu.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-250  In selecting Khe Sanh as the site for a set piece battle with the Americans  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-251  General Giap had chosen carefully.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-252  The jungle covered hills and low cloud combined with heavy fog...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-253  ...would work against American air power  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-254  And while his own troops were close to supplies and reinforcements  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-255  the Americans could be cut off from any outside help.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-256  The weakened garrison would then be overrun.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-257  From March 1967, the Americans had succeeded in sending...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-258  ...heavily armed convoys down route 9 to Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-259  However, in July, an attempt to get long range artillery to the combat base...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-260  ...was blocked by North Vietnamese Ambushes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-261  Soon the NVA had closed the road completely...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-262  ...and the first phase of the campaign against Khe Sanh was completed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-263  The next stage in the North Vietnamese plan...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-264  ...was to deploy infantry North and West of Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-265  The units to the North would capture the hills overlooking the base...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-266  and place artillery to bombard the Americans and destroy their airfield.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-267  They would also mount ground attacks to create a diversion.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-268  The Western units would capture Lang Vei Special Forces camp...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-269  ...and Khe Sanh village and then mount a massive assault...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-270  ...to take the Marine combat base from the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-271  A vital ingredient of General Giap's plan was to soften up Khe Sanh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-272  ...and its surrounding hill outposts with massive artillery bombardments.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-273  It was vital to prevent American aircraft from finding and destroying...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-274  ...the guns, mortars and rocket batteries before the attack.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-275  The troops made enormous efforts to protect the artillery...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-276  by hiding it in caves or specially dug pits.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-277  They sited huge numbers of anti aircraft guns to drive away...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-278  ...inquisitive reconnaissance planes...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-279  ...while everything was hidden by elaborate camouflage  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-280  STRATEGY – United States  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-281  From the start of the war in Vietnam, U.S. Military commanders...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-282  ...had believed that the best form of defense was to attack in strength.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-283  When reconnaissance detected a large enemy force  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-284  U.S. troops would be helicoptered in to surround and destroy it.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-285  Although often they flew straight into an ambush  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-286  in the main, the strategy worked.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-287  The problem with the American tactics was that they needed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-288  ever increasing numbers of troops and helicopters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-289  In Washington, Robert McNamara, the secretary of defense  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-290  worried that the constant demand for more men...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-291  ...would eventually destroy public support for the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-292  Throughout 1967 McNamara had pushed for a strategy...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-293  ...that would reduce the need for manpower.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-294  One proposal in particular McNamara adopted enthusiastically.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-295  The idea was to clear a line along the Demilitarized Zone...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-296  and build an electronic barrier to stop enemy infiltration from North to South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-297  The plan, called the “Strong Point Obstacle System”  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-298  was expected to cost a billion dollars.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-299  To U.S. troops on the ground, it made no sense.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-300  They christened it McNamara's Line.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-301  Because the Eastern part of the Demilitarized Zone was flat ground  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-302  the area was given the first priority for defense.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-303  The plan was for nine strong points including Con Thien and Gio Linh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-304  ...linked by fencing, mine fields and electronic detectors.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-305  West to Khe Sanh, U.S. Bases would act as anchors for short strips of line  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-306  ...blocking all the likely approaches.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-307  Artillery would cover the whole area.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-308  By the end of 1967, the Eastern part of the Strong Point Obstacle System...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-309  ...was almost complete.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-310  American planners hoped the new defense would at least channel...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-311  ...the North Vietnamese into the more difficult hilly terrain...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-312  ...guarded by the Rockpile and Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-313  In the future, when those bases too were part of the system  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-314  military commanders saw them playing a particularly important role:  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-315  If full scale ground operations were ever launched into Laos  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-316  the barrier would protect Americans from flank attacks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-317  The Strong Point Obstacle System was deeply unwelcome to U.S. commanders in the area.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-318  Building just the Eastern part imposed a heavy burden on the Marines.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-319  The line was soaking up vast amounts of material and manpower  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-320  ...restricting offensive operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-321  Worst of all, the construction work and the transport supplying it...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-322  ...were sitting targets for North Vietnamese gunners.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-323  THE OPPOSING FORCES – North Vietnamese Army  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-324  Altogether the North Vietnamese Army numbered just under 470,000 troops  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-325  in 12 divisions and 100 independent regiments.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-326  There was also a small navy for coastal patrol, and an air force...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-327  to defend against American bombing raids  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-328  together with an air defense missile force.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-329  China had also committed 50,000 advisors and engineers to repair damage...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-330  ...done by American bombing and so free North Vietnamese troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-331  ...for combat operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-332  By now, the NVA had taken over all military activity...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-333  ...in the northernmost parts of South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-334  ...and 102,000 NVA troops were available to fight in the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-335  All the same, the planned Tet offensive was not meant...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-336  ...to depend heavily on the Northern Army.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-337  The Southern guerrillas, the Vietcong would do most of the fighting.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-338  And just over a quarter of NVA units in the South...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-339  ...were to be committed to Tet  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-340  the rest would either be held back as a reserve...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-341  ...or thrown into the battle against the Americans at Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-342  By the start of 1968 the North Vietnamese Army...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-343  ...had more than 40,000 men positioned near the border with South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-344  One division was to launch attacks down the East coast...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-345  ...to take Da Nang and other important centers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-346  Four divisions and two regiments were massed for the assault on Khe Sanh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-347  ...and for follow up operations to seize the northern provinces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-348  North of Khe Sanh was the 325C division with three regiments and a battalion.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-349  The elite 304th Division was South of the base.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-350  The besieging forces were supported by three artillery formations...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-351  and anti aircraft units while a regiment handled resupply from the North.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-352  Further East another division was placed to threaten...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-353  the American artillery base at the Rockpile  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-354  to keep route 9 cut and to act as reinforcements.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-355  A small number of tanks were also positioned west of Lang Vei.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-356  If the battle for Khe Sanh was to end in victory  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-357  General Giap and his planners knew...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-358  ...that an uninterrupted flow of supplies would be the key.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-359  The experience in 1954 of fighting the French at Dien Bien Phu  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-360  ...had taught him the value of ensuring continuous supply...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-361  ...long before the final storming of the enemy base.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-362  He was determined to repeat his achievement at Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-363  To get ammunition, food and materials to the forces attacking Khe Sanh  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-364  Giap ordered the building of two new roads.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-365  They were soon detected by the Americans who named them “The Santa Fe trail”.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-366  U.S. fighter bombers made furious attacks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-367  but the roads were impossible to destroy or even damage seriously.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-368  The Santa Fe trail was heavily camouflaged and fully equipped...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-369  ...with bunkers, storage depots and way-stations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-370  The roads were protected by heavy anti aircraft cover.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-371  Already supplies had been built up near Khe Sanh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-372  ...for between 60 and 90 days of sustained combat.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-373  WEAPONS – North Vietnamese Army  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-374  For more than a decade the North Vietnamese Army...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-375  ...had been getting military equipment from China and the Soviet Union.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-376  The best NVA divisions were extremely well armed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-377  The rugged and effective AK-47 assault rifle was perfect...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-378  ...for the harsh battlefield conditions of Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-379  Infantry units had large numbers of machine guns...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-380  ...and RPG-7 anti tank grenade launchers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-381  The main defense against American air power for the troops around Khe Sanh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-382  ...was the Soviet K-38 heavy machine gun.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-383  Near special installations the NVA anti aircraft units were armed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-384  ...with 37 mm anti aircraft cannons...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-385  ...a menace even to the fastest American jets.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-386  The heavy artillery which NVA gunners would use to try and overwhelm...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-387  ...the defenses of the Khe Sanh base was also Soviet and Chinese.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-388  The 130 mm field gun had a range of 19 miles  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-389  ...further than any comparable American gun.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-390  U.S. troops rated it the best all-round artillery piece on the Vietnam battlefield.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-391  The guns would be reinforced by huge numbers of rockets and heavy mortars.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-392  THE TROOPS - North Vietnamese Army  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-393  The troops of the North Vietnamese Army were recognized...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-394  ...even by their American enemies as first class soldiers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-395  They were extremely well trained and disciplined.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-396  They were skilled in tactics and their morale and determination...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-397  ...often seemed to the Americans to border on the fanatical.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-398  In fact, during 1967, as losses soared  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-399  North Vietnamese Army morale had slumped badly.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-400  Desertion threatened to become a real problem.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-401  The grueling track from home bases to distant Khe Sanh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-402  ...had also taken its toll.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-403  American bombing was a constant danger, and diseases  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-404  ...particularly malaria, were rife.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-405  Most of the NVA soldiers who were massing to attack Khe Sanh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-406  ...were from the coastal lowlands of North Vietnam and found life a misery...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-407  in the sodden, insect infested jungles, as did their enemy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-408  In preparation for the Khe Sanh battle...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-409  NVA commanders went to enormous lengths to restore their troops' morale.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-410  Cultural groups were sent on the long and arduous journey...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-411  ...to the front to entertain the troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-412  The message was simple  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-413  and was reinforced at every opportunity by political officers:  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-414  The coming campaign would deliver the victory...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-415  ...they had hoped for for so many years.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-416  The propaganda effort worked well.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-417  In the final weeks before the offensive...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-418  ...desertions from the North Vietnamese Army fell dramatically.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-419  THE OPPOSING FORCES – United States  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-420  In late 1967, 73,000 of the almost half a million American troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-421  ...in South Vietnam were United States Marines.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-422  They were under the command of the U.S. Navy Pacific Fleet Headquarters in Honolulu  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-423  but operational control was with General Westmoreland's...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-424  ...Military Assistance Command in Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-425  From the start, the independent status of the Marines had led to friction.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-426  Often they were accused by the Army and the Air Force...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-427  ...of fighting their own private war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-428  Since Lieutenant General Robert Cushman had taken over...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-429  ...as Marine commander in June 1967  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-430  he and Westmoreland had argued continuously...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-431  ...over how the Marines should best be used.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-432  The latest issue was the McNamara Line.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-433  The idea was strongly opposed by the Marines  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-434  ...but Westmoreland had become a strong supporter.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-435  There was also a major disagreement brewing over...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-436  ...who should control Marine air power.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-437  On the eve of a major battle...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-438  inter-service rivalry was threatening to grow into a serious problem.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-439  All American units in I Corps were commanded by the III Marine Amphibious Force...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-440  ...with its headquarters at Da Nang.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-441  The force controlled the 1st and 3rd Marine Divisions  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-442  and elements of the 5th along with the 23rd Army division  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-443  two army brigades and a squadron of Armored Cavalry.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-444  The South Vietnamese Army deployed two divisions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-445  ...and an infantry regiment in I Corps  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-446  and there was also a brigade of Korean Marines.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-447  Air support for operations in I Corps was provided...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-448  ...by a U.S. Air Force tactical fighter wing  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-449  the 1st Marine air wing  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-450  and a South Vietnamese Air Force squadron.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-451  U.S. Navy aircraft were stationed on the carriers of Task Force 77  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-452  while three wings of B-52 bombers were also on call...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-453  ...from Thailand and Guam in the Pacific Ocean.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-454  Air Supply was carried out by Marine and Air Force...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-455  ...transport and helicopter squadrons.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-456  As more than a 100,000 men, half of all US combat units in South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-457  ...had been concentrated in I Corps  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-458  ...the supply system had been strained to the limit.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-459  On the DMZ alone ammunition consumption was running...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-460  ...at 25,000 artillery shells a month.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-461  The Marine's supply line stretched from the United States...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-462  ...to Okinawa in the Pacific and on into Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-463  The U.S. Forces required 21,000 tons of food  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-464  ...ammunition, fuel and general supplies daily.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-465  As a result there was a constant stream of ships...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-466  ...and air freight into Da Nang.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-467  Getting the supplies to where they were needed was a massive job.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-468  Vietnam was the first war to see computers used to control supplies.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-469  The requisitioning system handled over 80,000 different items...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-470  ...from boots for the men to spares for helicopters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-471  WEAPONS – U.S. Marines  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-472  Just like their North Vietnamese enemies...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-473  ...the Marine infantry would depend in the coming battles on supporting firepower.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-474  They had large numbers of medium and heavy mortars.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-475  The Marines would also make good use of 106 mm recoilless rifles.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-476  The M-40 had been designed as an anti tank weapon  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-477  but it was also highly effective against bunkers and trenches.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-478  Marine bases always had their own standard 105 mm artillery pieces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-479  The guns had a range of 7 miles.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-480  Some bases, including Khe Sanh also had powerful 155 mm Howitzers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-481  They could lob a heavy shell over 9 miles at a rate of 4 rounds a minute.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-482  The base could also call in supporting fire...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-483  ...from the Army's huge 175mm self propelled guns.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-484  These weapons could fire a 170 pound shell 23 miles  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-485  just enough to reach the Khe Sanh area from the Rockpile or Camp Carroll.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-486  Support from aircraft was much less reliable than artillery.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-487  Air operations could be shut down completely by bad weather.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-488  But in the right conditions fighter bombers could bring...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-489  ...devastating fire power to the battlefield.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-490  A-4 SkyHawks operating from carriers in the Tonkin gulf...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-491  ...or from Marine airfields could be over the Khe Sanh area...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-492  ...in less than 30 minutes with a ton and a half of bombs.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-493  Navy, Marine and Air Force Phantoms were also on call.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-494  Although designed as an interceptor, the F-4 was a powerful bomber.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-495  It could carry 18 750 pound bombs...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-496  or 11 canisters of the devastating flammable gel NAPALM.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-497  THE TROOPS – U.S. Marines  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-498  As an elite formation which could attract recruits of the highest quality  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-499  the United States Marines had for years been an all volunteer force.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-500  Vietnam had forced to change.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-501  Restricting tours of duty to 13 months and a steady accumulation of casualties  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-502  meant the Marine corps had to take in draftees.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-503  Around 20,000 men had been drafted in by the end of 1967.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-504  Basic training had been cut too, down from 12 to 8 weeks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-505  There was also a severe shortage of skilled personnel...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-506  ...particularly helicopter pilots.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-507  In spite of the sometimes appalling conditions of cold, wet and dirt  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-508  in which the Marines in Vietnam had to live and fight  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-509  the morale had stood up well.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-510  Marine discipline and the sense of being part of an elite helped.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-511  So did the knowledge that support from artillery  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-512  helicopter gunship or strike aircraft was not far away.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-513  But nothing helped the morale of the men...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-514  as much as the superb medical evacuation and treatment system.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-515  After emergency treatment by a medic on the spot  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-516  a wounded man could expect to be picked up by a med-evac helicopter  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-517  ...in less than half an hour.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-518  The crews of evacuation helicopters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-519  ...were among the most admired troops serving in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-520  The pilots would go to extraordinary lengths to get wounded men away...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-521  ...even under heavy fire.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-522  In I Corps evacuation was to one of three field hospitals...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-523  ...or to the main hospital at Da Nang.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-524  There were also two fully equipped Navy hospital ships...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-525  ...each with more than 500 beds.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-526  So effective was the Marine med-evac system...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-527  that 99% of evacuated Marines survived their wounds.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-528  EVE OF BATTLE  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-529  As evidence had mounted that the North Vietnamese...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-530  ...were going to attack Khe Sanh  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-531  the Americans took a quick decision to reinforce the base.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-532  By the close of 1967 the third battalion of the 26th Marines  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-533  ...had arrived to boost the garrison.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-534  New bunkers, quarters, and perimeter defenses had to be built fast.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-535  Building materials that were meant for the McNamara Line...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-536  ...were quickly diverted to Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-537  Only days after the new Marine unit had arrived to Khe Sanh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-538  it launched a major Search and Destroy operation towards the border with Laos.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-539  The Marines discovered North Vietnamese weapons caches and fresh trails  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-540  but not a single enemy soldier opened fire.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-541  Unknown to the Americans the 30,000 NVA troops all around...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-542  ...were under strict orders to avoid all contact.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-543  Christmas 1967 came and went on the Demilitarized Zone  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-544  but the North Vietnamese stayed uncannily quiet.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-545  However, there were signs of intense NVA reconnaissance around Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-546  Most Marines now believed the question was not...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN08-547  ...whether the North Vietnamese meant to storm Khe Sanh but when.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-1  BATTLEFIELD VIETNAM  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-2  Air War Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-3  From February 1965 to November 1968 the United States waged...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-4  ...a massive bombing campaign against North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-5  Operation Rolling Thunder sent American warplanes...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-6  ...against heavily defended targets.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-7  It was a destructive and costly battle...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-8  ...as both sides used ever more sophisticated weapons and tactics.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-9  In Rolling Thunder American aircraft dropped...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-10  ...over 650,000 tons of bombs on North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-11  There were also massive operations in South Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-12  ...supporting American ground troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-13  ...and against communist supply lines and bases in Laos and Cambodia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-14  The air war in South East Asia was more than a contest...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-15  ...between United States and North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-16  From the start America's cold war enemies China and the Soviet Union  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-17  were backing the North with weapons advisors and support personnel.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-18  For U.S. leaders, that raised the most difficult question they had ever faced.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-19  Could the air war be won without sparking off a wider...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-20  ...and infinitely more dangerous conflict?  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-21  PRELUDE TO THE BATTLE  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-22  The United States Air Force began its war in South East Asia...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-23  more than three years before American combat troops set foot in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-24  In late 1961 president John F. Kennedy ordered more help...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-25  ...for the South Vietnamese government in its war against the Vietcong guerrillas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-26  U.S. backing included new equipment  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-27  and more than 3,000 military advisors and support personnel.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-28  Soon, U.S. Army and Marine helicopters were flying...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-29  ...South Vietnamese government soldiers and their American advisors...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-30  ...into combat against the Vietcong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-31  U.S. Air Force transport planes helped with troop deployments and supplies.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-32  Meanwhile, reconnaissance aircraft searched for guerrilla units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-33  ...and interceptors defended South Vietnamese air space against North Vietnamese...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-34  ...or even possibly Soviet or Chinese intruders.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-35  Amongst the first U.S. Air Force units sent to Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-36  was a small detachment of helicopters disguised in South Vietnamese markings.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-37  Under special rules of engagement codenamed Farm Gate  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-38  ...the aircraft were flown by U.S. personnel...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-39  ...but had to have a South Vietnamese Air Force officer on board.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-40  Unofficially, they were flying combat missions against the NLF.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-41  In spite of American efforts the NLF inflicted a series of defeats...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-42  ...on the South Vietnamese Army in 1963.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-43  Guerrilla numbers were rising and were better armed and led than ever.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-44  With each month that passed, the NLF was getting more weapons, ammunition...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-45  ...and trained men from North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-46  The main supply route from North Vietnam, the Ho Chi Minh trail  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-47  ran inside Laos and Cambodia to the NLF's base areas in the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-48  The trail was manned by North Vietnamese Army troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-49  ...with the help of Laotian guerrillas who were waging their own war...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-50  ...against the Lao government.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-51  The NLF guerrillas were concentrating in the Mekong delta, around Saigon...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-52  ...and in the Central and Northern parts of Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-53  It was near these areas that the Americans stationed helicopter companies...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-54  ...to carry South Vietnamese troops into battle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-55  The detachment operating under Farm Gate was based at Bien Hoa, near Saigon  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-56  ...and there was another important base at Tan Son Nhut.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-57  Three smaller airfields also supported fixed wing operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-58  By the end of 1963, Farm Gate pilots soon known as Air Commandos  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-59  were flying more than 80 missions a week.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-60  They attacked Vietcong base areas and river traffic...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-61  and were credited with killing hundreds maybe thousands of guerrillas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-62  Operation Ranch Hand flights spraying a deadly herbicide...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-63  to destroy jungle cover were also flown under Farm Gate rules.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-64  The spraying, which began in early 1962 cleared the vegetation alongside highways.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-65  Vietcong ambushes would then be far easier to spot.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-66  Ranch Hand missions were soon extended beyond preventing ambushes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-67  Vast tracts of forest were sprayed with agent orange  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-68  a herbicide containing the deadly chemical dioxin.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-69  Guerrilla trails and base areas were exposed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-70  ...and crops that might feed Vietcong units, were destroyed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-71  By the summer of 1971 operation Ranch Hand had sprayed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-72  11 million gallons of agent orange containing 240 pounds of dioxin...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-73  ...and destroyed 6 million acres of South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-74  1/7 of the country's total area was laid waste.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-75  Herbicides containing dioxin were banned for use in the U.S.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-76  ...by the department of agriculture in 1968.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-77  In Vietnam the spraying continued until 1971.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-78  YANKEE TEAM  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-79  Between April and June 1964 American air power in Southeast Asia...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-80  ...was massively reinforced.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-81  Two aircraft carriers arrived off the Vietnamese coast.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-82  The move was prompted by an NVA offensive in Laos.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-83  To help Laotian government forces, U.S. aircraft mounted...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-84  ...a big reconnaissance effort codenamed Operation Yankee Team.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-85  Soon after Yankee Team began, two navy planes...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-86  ...were lost to anti aircraft fire over Laos.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-87  The air force retaliated by hitting the enemy gun positions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-88  ...in the first jet bombing raids in Southeast Asia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-89  As well as photographing the activities of the Laotian guerrillas  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-90  American aircraft over Laos were monitoring the Ho Chi Minh trail.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-91  It was clear that North Vietnam was sending more men and supplies...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-92  ...to the Southern guerrillas than ever before.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-93  In Washington, the new U.S. president Lyndon Johnson  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-94  ...was being pressed hard by his military commanders to punish the North.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-95  So far Johnson had refused to sanction official direct attacks on North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-96  However, covert attacks were being conducted over Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-97  ...near the Laotian border.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-98  It was an incident in the Tonkin gulf that finally lit the fuse.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-99  In bad weather conditions the captain of an American destroyer...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-100  thought he was fired upon by North Vietnamese patrol boats  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-101  ...an attack that actually never happened.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-102  But on August 5th 1964 the president ordered retaliation.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-103  Operation Pierce Arrow was launched by the carriers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-104  ...Ticonderoga and Constellation.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-105  Aircraft from Constellation bombed North Vietnamese naval facilities...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-106  ...at Hon Gai and Loc Chau  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-107  with the loss of two American aircraft.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-108  Fuel storage tanks and a patrol boat base at Vinh...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-109  ...and another base at Quang Khe were attacked by aircraft from Ticonderoga.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-110  Later, a follow up strike completed the devastation at Vinh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-111  In North Vietnam the American bombing raids immediately triggered a secret plan.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-112  For years, the North had been creating an Air Force with Soviet built jet fighters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-113  The force had been based in China.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-114  The day after the American bombings the fighters were called home.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-115  Even as the North Vietnamese fighters began to patrol out of the new base  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-116  the Americans rushed their own reinforcements to the region.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-117  The Air Force deployed more than 70 planes to Vietnam and Thailand.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-118  The Navy sent two more carriers steaming towards the gulf of Tonkin.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-119  As tension in Southeast Asia rose sharply  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-120  U.S. intelligence learned of an ominous development.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-121  In October 1964, China Vietnam's neighbor and ally  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-122  successfully tested an atomic bomb.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-123  In the closing weeks of 1964, American aircraft...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-124  ...launched a new campaign in Southeast Asia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-125  The aim was to find and destroy North Vietnamese transport...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-126  ...and installations on the Ho Chi Minh trail in Laos.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-127  For the Americans, operation Barrel Roll was the start of an attempt...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-128  ...to cut off supplies to the NLF that would last for a full 8 years.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-129  By February 8th 1965 NLF guerrillas in South Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-130  ...had launched a series of attacks on U.S. installations and personnel.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-131  The United States was determined to hold North Vietnam responsible.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-132  Carrier aircraft had been kept ready to retaliate...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-133  ...if the president gave the order.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-134  On February 7th 1965, they were unleashed against North Vietnamese targets.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-135  Operation Flaming Dart was launched from the carriers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-136  Ranger, Hancock and Coral Sea...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-137  ...and from air fields in South Vietnam by both U.S. and South Vietnamese planes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-138  The targets were North Vietnamese Army barracks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-139  ...and the 325th Infantry Division training base at Dong Hoi.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-140  Because of bad weather only one target was hit in strength...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-141  at the cost of an aircraft shot down.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-142  In the next five days, more retaliation raids again hit army barracks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-143  Three American aircraft were lost.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-144  Up to now the American air strikes on the North...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-145  ...had been in retaliation for particular incidents.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-146  However many in Washington believed that bombing...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-147  ...should have a much bigger role to play.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-148  They argued a sustained campaign of attacks could make North Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-149  ...stop supporting the war in the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-150  Military planners had long ago been given permission...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-151  ...to prepare a major bombing offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-152  It was codenamed Operation Rolling Thunder.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-153  On February 13th 1965 the White House gave the 'go ahead'.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-154  Two weeks later on March 2nd after a series of delays...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-155  ...the Americans launched the first raid of the new campaign.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-156  The initial plan was to launch two or three strikes every week.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-157  But by March 19th, with Rolling Thunder 7  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-158  ...the air strikes became a sustained and regular effort.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-159  Rolling Thunder got off to an uncertain start.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-160  The first mission flown by more than 100 aircraft...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-161  ...hit an ammunition dump in the Quang Khe naval base.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-162  Five U.S. aircraft were lost.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-163  In the following weeks, North Vietnamese Radars, reilway bridges and military bases...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-164  ...were attacked but more American aircraft were shot down.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-165  Already, it looked like an air war over North Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-166  ...might prove far more costly than anyone had expected.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-167  THE LEADERS – United States  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-168  The American President, Lyndon Johnson  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-169  doubted that bombing North Vietnam would be enough to save the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-170  By now, he was resigned to using American troops to fight the guerrillas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-171  The first combat units had already landed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-172  Johnson's biggest worry, shared by his defense secretary Robert McNamara  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-173  was that bombing North Vietnam might spark off a much bigger war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-174  The Soviet Union and China had been supporting the North...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-175  with financial and  military aid for years.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-176  If the American bombing was too fierce...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-177  ...they might be forced to come to its defense.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-178  After that, anything could happen.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-179  Johnson's fears that the war in Vietnam could spiral out of control...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-180  ...were not shared by his military leaders.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-181  The Joint Chiefs of Staff did not believe that the Chinese or the Soviets...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-182  ...would intervene no matter how hard the U.S. hit the North.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-183  What they wanted was a quick and devastating campaign.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-184  Whatever the doubts of his military leaders, Johnson was sure...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-185  ...that massive bombing of North Vietnam would draw in the Chinese.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-186  The only course the president could see...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-187  ...was to keep strict control of the offensive himself.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-188  Each week, the list of targets to be struck  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-189  would have to be approved by him at the White House.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-190  THE LEADERS – North Vietnam / China  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-191  The first American bombing raids had come as a severe shock...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-192  ...to the leaders of North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-193  Neither the president Ho Chi Minh, nor his government...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-194  ...had expected the Americans to go so far  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-195  but there was no question of giving in.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-196  On April 8th 1965, Premier Pham Van Dong  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-197  replied to a peace overture from the American president...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-198  ...with his own list of uncompromising demands.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-199  For ten years Ho Chi Minh's aim had been...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-200  ...to reunite the two halves of Vietnam under communist rule.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-201  Now, the NLF guerrillas in the South were so close to victory...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-202  ...he saw no reason why he should negotiate.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-203  The problem was if the North were bombed into oblivion  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-204  or invaded by American and South Vietnamese forces, all would be lost.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-205  Only with massive help from the Soviet Union and China...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-206  ...could North Vietnam hope to survive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-207  The two superpowers had already given nearly a billion dollars...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-208  ...worth of aid over ten years but Ho was appealing urgently for more.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-209  Ho meant to play on the bitter rivalry between the two powers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-210  ...to get all the help he could.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-211  At first the Soviet Union under premier Alexei Kosygin...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-212  ...had urged Northern leaders to look for a peaceful solution.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-213  But Kosygin was actually in Hanoi in february 1965 when Rolling Thunder began.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-214  The Russian position hardened.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-215  The Soviets now promised sophisticated radar, air defense missiles...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-216  ...and more jet fighters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-217  China under its leader Mao Tse Tung went much further than the Soviet Union.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-218  Mao promised to send combat infantry if the country were invaded.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-219  Meantime, to help the North defend itself against the bombing  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-220  he promised anti aircraft units.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-221  Mao meant to guarantee the survival of his neighbor whatever the risks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-222  STRATEGY – United States  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-223  From the start, the American bombing offensive against North Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-224  ...was meant to meet a whole range of different objectives.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-225  The military chiefs, including Admiral Sharp  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-226  ...the commander of U.S. Pacific forces  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-227  ...wanted to wreck the North's capacity to make war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-228  The U.S. Ambassador in Saigon, Maxwell Taylor  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-229  saw the raids as a morale booster for South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-230  The defense secretary, Robert McNamara meant them to put on pressure...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-231  which could be stepped up gradually until the North agreed to U.S. demands.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-232  The first targets of the Rolling Thunder campaign had been chosen...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-233  ...mainly for their political and psychological impact.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-234  However, to justify the mounting toll of lost pilots and aircraft  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-235  McNamara now wanted more concrete results.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-236  He argued that the campaign against North Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-237  ...should be much more closely linked to the war in the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-238  The new American plan for Operation Rolling Thunder...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-239  focused on the part of North Vietnam between the Demilitarized Zone  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-240  separating North and South, and the 20th parallel.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-241  Inside this area, railway lines, bridges, and a vital railyard at Vinh were all used...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-242  ...to send supplies and reinforcements to guerrilla units in the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-243  These lines of communication were to be cut...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-244  ...in a three week campaign which would steadily move North.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-245  Armed reconnaissance would then destroy the transport...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-246  ...trapped by the broken bridges and rail lines.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-247  To U.S. military leaders the decision to attack North Vietnamese transport...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-248  ...was a move in the right direction  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-249  but it was nowhere near as destructive as the campaign they wanted.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-250  The Joint Chiefs still argued for an all out offensive...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-251  to destroy North Vietnam's military centers air defenses, power stations and ports.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-252  President Johnson and Robert McNamara were adamant...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-253  ...that there would be no all out campaign.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-254  This was to be a limited war to achieve limited objectives.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-255  In any case McNamara and other officials argued  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-256  ...the most valuable targets should be kept as hostages.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-257  To save those, North Vietnam would have to agree to negotiate.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-258  STRATEGY – North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-259  When the Rolling Tunder campaign had begun North Vietnam's leaders had feared...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-260  ...that in a very short time their country could be bombed into rubble.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-261  The air defense system was still primitive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-262  If the Americans meant to launch an all out offensive  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-263  there was little the fledgling North Vietnamese air force could do to stop them.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-264  North Vietnam hoped that open support from its allies...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-265  particularly the Chinese could save it from full scale attack.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-266  There was every sign that Chinese meant what they said  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-267  about coming to the North's aid if necessary.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-268  In fact, China was taking the situation in Vietnam so seriously...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-269  ...it had changed its whole National Defense strategy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-270  Mao Tse Tung had long recognized that by helping North Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-271  ...he was risking a direct clash with the United States.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-272  He was determined to prepare.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-273  Mao ordered a massive defense program to ensure China could withstand...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-274  ...even a nuclear attack by the United States.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-275  He called it 'The Third Front'...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-276  and by March 1965 it was already well underway.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-277  The first stage of the 'Third Front' program had been to take Chinese industries  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-278  mostly concentrated around the big cities  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-279  ...and split them in two.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-280  The duplicates would then move deep into the interior.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-281  Already, fortifications were being built for defense in depth...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-282  ...and every province was creating its own light armaments industry.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-283  Meanwhile, North Vietnam's defenses against American bombing...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-284  were also being reinforced.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-285  China had already moved four full air divisions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-286  ...and an anti aircraft division to its border with Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-287  It built airfields close to the frontier...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-288  ...as sanctuary and repair facilities for North Vietnam's jet fighters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-289  Inside Vietnam, new airfields would be built and old ones repaired.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-290  Chinese logistics teams were already constructing...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-291  ...or upgrading 12 roads North of Hanoi.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-292  In North Vietnam, full scale mobilization...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-293  ...was being carried out at a frantic pace  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-294  many believed that an invasion might follow the air assault.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-295  A million people were organized into repair and construction teams.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-296  In a massive program they dug thousands of miles of trenches  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-297  and millions of single person air raid shelters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-298  Soon, in Hanoi, there would be a shelter on average every 20 feet.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-299  To the leaders of the North building defenses...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-300  ...and acquiring advanced weaponry was only one part of the strategy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-301  There was also the political battle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-302  There would be a major propaganda offensive...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-303  ...to pressure the Americans into restricting...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-304  ...or even stopping their attacks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-305  THE OPPOSING FORCES – United States  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-306  For more than 20 years American military planning...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-307  ...had given the highest priority to strategic bombers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-308  The U.S. had built a huge force of long range aircraft...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-309  ...able to attack targets deep inside the Soviet Union with nuclear weapons.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-310  As the conflict with North Vietnam had intensified...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-311  Strategic Air Command had modified its giant B-52's...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-312  ...to carry conventional bombs.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-313  Although the B-52's had been stationed ready to attack North Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-314  ...in the end they had been kept out of Rolling Thunder.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-315  The White House believed that the massive, high altitude bombers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-316  ...were just too destructive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-317  They could be seen as a massive escalation of the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-318  Instead, the smaller and more accurate tactical bombers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-319  ...would fight the strategic campaign against the North.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-320  They would also carry out their normal role...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-321  ...by supporting ground operations in South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-322  While the Air Force and Marine aircraft would fly most missions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-323  ...inside South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-324  a large part of the strikes against the North would be mounted by the navy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-325  The U.S. Navy had 16 strike carriers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-326  ...and deployed more aircraft than all the world's other navys combined.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-327  By the end of 1965, 10 different carriers would have taken part...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-328  ...in Rolling Thunder operations over North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-329  U.S. naval air power off Vietnam was under the command of Task Force 77.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-330  Its carriers would operate from two areas...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-331  ...codenamed Yankee and Dixie stations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-332  Aircraft from Yankee station would attack targets in North Vietnam and Laos  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-333  ...while planes from Dixie would fly over South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-334  American Air Force units were controlled by the 2nd Air Division.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-335  In 1965, the Division operated from two main air fields in Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-336  ...and five in Thailand.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-337  The 1st Marine Air wing would deploy fighter aircraft...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-338  ...at another two airfields in Northern South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-339  while B-52 wings of Strategic Air Command operated...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-340  ...from Guam, in the Pacific and later from Thailand...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-341  ...with refueling tankers form Okinawa.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-342  U.S. Air commanders had a limited say...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-343  ...in how the battle over North Vietnam was fought.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-344  The White House was not only choosing the targets...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-345  ...but decided on almost every other detail of each attack.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-346  Washington specified the day and often the time of each mission...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-347  ...and sometimes even the type of bombs to be used.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-348  From the approved list American pilots were given a target...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-349  ...and one or two alternatives only those targets could be attacked.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-350  The monsoon weather were still enveloping North Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-351  ...making some targets impossible to hit at the time specified in Washington.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-352  Air commanders had no authority to improvise.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-353  WEAPONS – United States  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-354  The main burden of the U.S. Air Force's war against North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-355  would fall on a single aircraft type.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-356  The F-105 Thunderchief was originally designed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-357  ...as a supersonic long-range nuclear bomber.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-358  The single-seater could carry up to 5 tons of bombs  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-359  ...more than a WWII B-17 flying fortress.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-360  As a fighter escort and for light attack  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-361  ...the Air Force had the F-100 Supersabre.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-362  The F-100 could carry almost 4 tons of bombs.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-363  It was also armed with air to air missiles and four 20mm cannon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-364  For bombing missions the U.S. Navy still relied heavily...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-365  ...on the propeller driven Skyraider.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-366  Although the aircraft had been in service more than 20 years and was very slow  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-367  it could carry a heavy load of bombs and rockets.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-368  It also had astonishing endurance...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-369  ...and was able to stay over a target area for hours at a time.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-370  As Rolling Thunder developed the Skyraider would be gradually replaced...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-371  ...in the Navy's attack squadrons by the A-4 Skyhawk.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-372  The Skyhawk could carry 4 tons of bombs but it was a slow aircraft  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-373  ...able to reach only 670 miles per hour.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-374  Skyhawk raids were usually escorted by Crusader fighters  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-375  ...armed with both cannon and air to air missiles.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-376  By April 1965 the American's most versatile aircraft...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-377  was already deployed in Southeast Asia by Air Force, Navy and Marine units.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-378  The F-4 Phantom was a big aircraft...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-379  ...and was able to fly at more than twice the speed of sound  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-380  1,400 miles per hour.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-381  It could also carry a bomb load of up to 8 tons.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-382  As Phantom units took on a bigger role in the war against North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-383  ...one unforeseen shortcoming would soon emerge.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-384  The F-4 had been designed to depend for self defense on its missiles  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-385  ...it had never been fitted with cannon for close range air combat.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-386  THE MEN – United States  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-387  Every aircraft deployed by an Air Force fighter wing...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-388  ...or a U.S. Navy carrier  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-389  depended on more than 30 men to keep it flying.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-390  A carrier had a crew of around 4,000 crammed into the ship...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-391  ...alongside planes, bombs and stores.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-392  Because the carrier was operating 24 hours a day  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-393  the men worked in shifts up to 16 hours long.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-394  In Thailand and South Vietnam conditions for Air Force personnel...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-395  ...were easier. All the same, heat and humidity...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-396  ...took a heavy toll on men and machines.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-397  To add to the burden higher command often measured...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-398  ...the success of a unit by the sheer number of sorties it could fly.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-399  Whether Navy or Air Force morale was high amongst the air crew...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-400  ...who were going into combat over North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-401  Aircraft and pilots had been lost...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-402  ...and the enemy's air defenses were still being developed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-403  The monsoon weather still enveloping the North...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-404  ...was often a bigger concern than the anti aircraft guns  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-405  so too were the strict rules of engagement that pilots had to memorize.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-406  Washington had ordered that only confirmed military targets could be hit  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-407  ...and then never in civilian areas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-408  Enemy aircraft had to be identified visually before they could be attacked  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-409  ...in case they were Chinese.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-410  And there was a host of other restrictions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-411  Such rules had never been part of the training of U.S. pilots.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-412  But crew were left in no doubt that infringements would lead...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-413  ...to serious disciplinary action.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-414  THE OPPOSING FORCES – North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-415  The North Vietnamese armed forces fielded 400,000 men...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-416  ...in 13 regular divisions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-417  All divisions had their own anti aircraft guns.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-418  So did the units operating in Laos  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-419  ...building and running the Ho Chi Minh trail.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-420  The Navy played a role in air defense too.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-421  Its fleet of East-German gunboats were stationed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-422  ...on the sea and river approaches to important targets.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-423  From its beginnings, the North Vietnamese Air Force was part of the Army.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-424  As well as its planes and a small number of helicopters  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-425  the Air Force controlled the Anti Aircraft Command  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-426  a specialized anti aircraft artillery formation.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-427  It also controlled and increasingly sophisticated...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-428  early warning Radar system supplied by the Soviet Union and China.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-429  North Vietnam's only fighter wing, the 921st  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-430  was based at Noi Bai airfield, 40 Km from Hanoi.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-431  A second wing, the 923rd was planned for the airfield being built at Kep.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-432  There was also a training wing and a wing of Ilyushin bombers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-433  ...at Cat Bi and Phuc Yen.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-434  The anti aircraft gun batteries of the Air Defense Force...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-435  ...were organized into 4 brigades...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-436  concentrated around areas of strategic importance:  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-437  The main road and rail junctions  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-438  the industrial centers around Hanoi and Haiphong  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-439  and the main supply routes to Laos and the South...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-440  were most heavily defended.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-441  Anti aircraft units were also deployed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-442  along the irrigation system of the Red River valley.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-443  Although North Vietnam's air defenses were still weak  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-444  ...they would soon become amongst the most formidable...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-445  ...ever assembled anywhere.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-446  The plan was to coordinate the efforts of radar sites and observation posts  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-447  ...anti aircraft guns and the fighter interceptors.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-448  The planes would try to ambush the enemy...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-449  ...and if they couldn't shoot him down, at least force him...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-450  ...to fly through heavy ground fire.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-451  In the early days of the air battle  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-452  close cooperation between radar, guns and fighters  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-453  ...would not be easy to achieve.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-454  There were too many different anti aircraft commands.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-455  Soon, as Soviet built anti aircraft missiles became operational  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-456  another ingredient would be added to the already complex system.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-457  For a long time to come North Vietnamese pilots...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-458  would run a very high risk of being shot down by friendly fire.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-459  WEAPONS – North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-460  The mainstay of the North Vietnamese Air Force was the Mig-17 jet fighter.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-461  It was an aging design the top speed of only 710 miles an hour  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-462  and was later replaced by the more advanced Mig-21.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-463  Yet the Mig-17 was still a formidable interceptor.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-464  It was one of the most maneuverable jets ever built  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-465  and armed with three cannon it was deadly in a dogfight.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-466  By now, the air defense force had a large number...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-467  ...of Soviet and Chinese anti aircraft guns.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-468  At the start of the battle they were still simple types with optical sights.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-469  The 23 and 37 mm twins could fire 100 rounds a minute from each barrel...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-470  ...but could only reach targets up to 10,000 feet.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-471  The bigger 57mm anti aircraft guns had a ceiling of 18,000 feet.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-472  American pilots could avoid them by flying higher  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-473  but in the last moments of an attack aircraft had to come in low.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-474  It was then that the 57mm was an extremely dangerous weapon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-475  The North Vietnamese regional militia now had half a million members  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-476  and was equipped with large numbers of light machine guns.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-477  Against low flying planes they could be highly effective.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-478  Militia were even taught to use their rifles against enemy raiders  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-479  as even a chance hit by a single bullet...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-480  ...could bring down a million dollar aircraft in flames.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-481  THE MEN – North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-482  The advanced weaponry supplied by the Soviet Union and China...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-483  depended completely on skilled personnel to operate it and maintain it.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-484  North Vietnam was an agricultural country with little industry.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-485  200 North Vietnamese Air Force technicians had been trained in China...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-486  ...but it was barely enough.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-487  There was also a shortage of skilled radar operators.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-488  From the start of the American attacks the pilots of the 921st fighter wing...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-489  ...had been keen to get into combat.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-490  They had been training at a furious pace.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-491  Gunnery was given the highest priority.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-492  Pilots practiced opening fire at ranges down to 150 meters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-493  ...to get a kill on the first pass.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-494  All the time the emphasis was on close in engagements...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-495  to make the most of the Mig-17's agility.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-496  At the same time, the Air Force was training the next batch of pilots...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-497  ...as fast as it possibly could.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-498  Most of the training of pilots radar operators and anti aircraft gunners  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-499  was being carried out by Soviet and Chinese military experts.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-500  Many had already taken part in combat operations...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-501  ...actually directing the defense.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-502  At a higher level, behind the scenes, there were Soviet and Chinese staff officers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-503  ...working to improve the performance...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-504  of every branch of the North Vietnamese armed forces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-505  ESCALATION  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-506  For the Americans the first stage in stepping up...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-507  ...the campaign against North Vietnam was to weaken its defenses.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-508  In the last week of March, 1965  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-509  U.S. attack planes from the carriers Hancock and Coral Sea...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-510  ...hit key North Vietnamese Radar sites.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-511  There was a fierce reaction from Northern Anti aircraft guns...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-512  ...and several U.S. planes were shot down.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-513  As the Rolling Thunder campaign built up...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-514  the attacks did boost the confidence of the South Vietnamese government.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-515  Government forces were doing better on the battlefield too.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-516  Even so, in Washington the mood was bleak.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-517  On March 29th 1965 NLF guerrillas launched...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-518  ...a daring bomb attack on the American embassy in Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-519  Two Americans and 20 South Vietnamese were killed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-520  To many in Washington the attack seemed to underline...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-521  ...the need for much stronger measures to be taken in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-522  By now, President Johnson himself was pushing for vigorous action.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-523  He gave permission for the Marines already in Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-524  ...to be used in combat operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-525  Few doubted that more troop deployments would follow.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-526  Soon U.S. Aircraft would be faced with two missions in Southeast Asia:  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-527  The continuing campaign against North Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN09-528  ...and supporting U.S. troops in a sharply escalating ground war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-1  BATTLEFIELD VIETNAM  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-2  Rolling Thunder  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-3  The American campaign against North Vietnam's transport system...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-4  ...began on April 3rd 1965.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-5  In a month long offensive Navy and Air Force planes...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-6  ...hit bridges, road and rail junctions truck parks and supply depots.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-7  For the Americans one of the most important targets...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-8  ...was the Ham Rung bridge across the Song Ma river.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-9  The bridge was a chokepoint for troops and supplies moving Southwards.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-10  In spite of repeated attempts the Americans failed to destroy the target.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-11  Two U.S. planes were lost to Mig fighters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-12  and more to anti aircraft defenses.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-13  Although the bombing was meant to damage...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-14  the North Vietnamese military transport system  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-15  it also had political aims  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-16  it was supposed to pressure the North to stop supporting...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-17  ...NLF guerrillas fighting in the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-18  In spite of the mounting damage Ho Chi Minh, the Northern president  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-19  ...was defiant.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-20  In South Vietnam the NLF were doing well on the battlefield.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-21  South Vietnamese government forces were on the defensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-22  Ho meant to continue supporting the war as long as his Chinese and Soviet allies...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-23  provided the weapons and financial support to carry on.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-24  North Vietnam's war materials from the Soviet Union and China...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-25  came overland by rail or by sea into the major ports...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-26  ...of Haiphong, Hong Gai and Cam Pha.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-27  Supplies and troops destined for the war in the South were then sent on...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-28  ...to staging areas, especially Dong Hoi.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-29  From there, they traveled into Laos by truck and bicycle...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-30  ...down the Ho Chi Minh trail into South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-31  More troops and supplies went South by sea.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-32  American aircraft had already attacked junctions, bridges, troop staging areas  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-33  and supply depots vital to the North's supply effort.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-34  However, the North East quadrant  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-35  with the population centers of Hanoi and Haiphong  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-36  would be left alone for the time being, at least.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-37  So too would the transport links to China, around which there were now...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-38  ...heavy concentrations of Chinese anti aircraft guns.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-39  As the Rolling Thunder campaign continued, opposition to the bombing...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-40  ...grew in the United States and around the world.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-41  On May, 13th 1965 U.S. President Lyndon Johnson  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-42  agreed to halt the bombing for five days.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-43  As Johnson had expected North Vietnam firmly rejected his overture.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-44  In the months that followed the bombing pause  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-45  Rolling Thunder attacks were steadily intensified.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-46  Transportation was still the top priority  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-47  but the list of targets approved by the White House was steadily broadened.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-48  The planes also began to range further North than before.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-49  Soon U.S. fighters had shot down their first Migs of the air war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-50  SAMS  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-51  By July 1965 a ring of Soviet supplied surface to air missile batteries...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-52  ...surrounded key sites in North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-53  The SAM was 35 feet long and radar guided.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-54  It could hit a target 20 miles away...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-55  and it was one of the most advanced anti aircraft weapons in the world.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-56  If the SAM's warhead detonated anywhere within 200 feet of an aircraft...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-57  ...it would almost certainly bring it down in flames.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-58  The missile defenses destroyed the first U.S. aircraft...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-59  ...in late July 1965.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-60  In the coming months, one in every 20 SAMs fired would hit its target.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-61  By the end of 1965 they had lost 171 planes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-62  For American air commanders the SAMs were a nightmare.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-63  The only solution was to try and stay outside their range...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-64  ...for as long as possible.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-65  American aircraft were now attacking some carefully selected targets  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-66  ...inside the Northeastern quadrant of North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-67  However they had orders to avoid prohibited zones...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-68  ...of ten miles around the capital Hanoi  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-69  ...and four miles around the port of Haiphong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-70  In bigger zones around both cities attacks were severely restricted  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-71  and the aircraft also had to stay out of the buffer zone...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-72  ...along the border with China.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-73  It was in the Northeastern quadrant that the North Vietnamese had built up...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-74  the heaviest concentrations of fighters and anti aircraft missiles.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-75  The Americans knew the operating ranges of the Mig's and the SAMs  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-76  Attacking aircraft took elaborate measures to avoid them...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-77  ...until the last possible moment.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-78  SAM missile sites were hard to find and even harder to destroy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-79  To make the problem worse those inside the prohibited zones...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-80  ...around Hanoi and Haiphong could not be attacked at all.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-81  It would be months before the restriction was lifted.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-82  Avoiding SAMs posed some dangers to American pilots.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-83  The missiles were most dangerous to planes flying at 20,000 feet or above.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-84  A low flying aircraft was less at risk  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-85  but then it was inside the range of the anti aircraft guns.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-86  MIGS  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-87  By this time North Vietnam's Mig fighters were being sent into battle...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-88  ...whenever the odds seemed in their favor.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-89  Always they fought under strict control from the ground.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-90  Their tactics were to approach from behind and above the Americans...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-91  ...and then mount a sudden ambush.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-92  To the intense frustration of U.S. air commanders, American planes...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-93  ...were strictly forbidden to attack North Vietnamese fighter bases.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-94  The fear in the White House was that Chinese or Soviet advisors...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-95  ...might be killed, provoking retaliation.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-96  An even bigger worry was that if the North's Air Force were destroyed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-97  ...Chinese fighter units might take over the defense themselves.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-98  By September 1965, Migs had destroyed 11 U.S. aircraft in combat  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-99  ...but more than 20 Migs had been shot down by American planes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-100  Nearly 2/3 of the whole North Vietnamese fighter force was gone.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-101  In October 1965, General Giap the North Vietnamese defense chief  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-102  was forced to order the 921st fighter wing to cut back combat operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-103  THE SOUTH  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-104  On December 24th 1965 President Johnson announced...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-105  ...another temporary halt to the bombing of North Vietnam, and offered talks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-106  Meanwhile, the war in the South was gathering pace.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-107  By the start of 1966, 184,000 U.S. troops had arrived in the country.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-108  They were already launching big operations against the NLF guerrillas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-109  Months before, American leaders had decided that the air war in the South...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-110  ...would, if necessary, take priority over operations against the North.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-111  Hundreds of transport aircraft and fighter-bombers supported American troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-112  Strike aircraft could be called in by any combat unit in the field.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-113  Time after time, their bombs, rockets and Napalm saved American units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-114  ...from being overrun by the Vietcong...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-115  ...but they also hit thousands of civilians and their homes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-116  Against Vietcong troops in the open tactical fighter bombers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-117  ...were accurate and destructive weapons.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-118  However, against fortified guerrilla bases spread out under the forest canopy...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-119  ...they were almost useless.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-120  The solution suggested by the U.S. commander in Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-121  General Westmoreland was to carpet-bomb with B-52s.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-122  The B-52 could carry 51 750 and 500 pound bombs  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-123  a 13.5 ton payload.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-124  A modified version, the 'Big Belly'...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-125  ...could carry 108 750 and 500 bombs  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-126  ...a massive 31.75 tons.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-127  A cell of 3 B-52 could obliterate an area three miles long and 2 miles wide.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-128  B-52 raids were codenamed Arc Light.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-129  Each raid had involved a 12 hour round trip from Guam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-130  ...in the Pacific Ocean.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-131  The missions were possible only because for every bomber in the fleet...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-132  ...there was a tanker from Okinawa to refuel it in flight.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-133  The mission of the B-52 force was soon broadened...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-134  ...to include the Ho Chi Minh trail in Laos...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-135  ...and passes feeding the trail just inside North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-136  The bombers were also accurate enough...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-137  ...to support U.S. troops on the ground.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-138  Radar could direct the B-52s to a target day or night...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-139  up to 200 miles away and tell the crew exactly when to drop their bombs.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-140  BUILD UP  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-141  The pause in the bombing that President Johnson had ordered...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-142  ...in December 1965, lasted 37 days.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-143  When the bombing restarted it had coincided with appalling weather.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-144  North Vietnam was given a priceless breathing space...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-145  ...in which to boost its defenses.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-146  The North's most important installations were now defended...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-147  ...by 5,000 anti aircraft guns.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-148  They included new radar guided 85 and 100 mm weapons  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-149  ...able to bring down an aircraft at nearly 20,000 feet.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-150  More SAM missile sites had also been put in place.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-151  By now, 30 new fighter pilots had come back from training...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-152  in the Soviet Union and China along with more aircraft...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-153  ...to rebuild the fighter force.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-154  American aircraft losses were now 20 a month over North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-155  One in 40 planes flying into the heavily defended Northeast quadrant was lost.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-156  Pilot morale was beginning to suffer.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-157  Most were in combat every second day and some even more often.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-158  Realizing that dangerous problems were developing  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-159  the Americans moved to send more carrier pilots to Southeast Asia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-160  They also overhauled the supply system.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-161  At the same time other changes were made...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-162  ...to help reduce American casualties and boost morale.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-163  In April 1966 Yankee station and the carriers of Task Force 77...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-164  ...were moved nearer to North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-165  At the same time, two new Search and Rescue stations were created...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-166  ...called North and South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-167  The stations were placed on the routes most used by U.S. strike aircraft.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-168  Up to now, U.S. Air Force and Navy planes had taken turns...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-169  ...to hit different areas of North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-170  There were always problems of coordination.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-171  Now, the system was improved by allocating route packages.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-172  Route Package 1 was given to Military Assistance Command in the South...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-173  ...as part of the war in the Demilitarized Zone.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-174  The Air Force was assigned route packages 5 and 6A.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-175  The Navy concentrated its efforts on the route packages nearer the coast.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-176  The route package system allowed American pilots...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-177  ...to learn the defenses of their own target areas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-178  Combined with the Area Search and Rescue operations...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-179  ...it did help save pilots lives but did little to reduce aircraft losses.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-180  In May and June 1966 18 planes were shot down.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-181  7 pilots were picked up by the Search and Rescue forces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-182  By now, every American raid included attacks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-183  ...to suppress anti aircraft defenses.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-184  Strikes were also supported by a vast array of sophisticated technology.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-185  Early warning radar aircraft could alert pilots to Migs or SAM launches.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-186  Electronic warfare planes tried to jam anti aircraft radars.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-187  Wild weasel strike aircraft, armed with the new Shrike radar seeking missiles...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-188  ...were deployed to hit the SAM sites.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-189  The Americans also had a new and formidable attack aircraft.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-190  The A-6 Intruder, had the world's most sophisticated...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-191  ...electronic navigation and targeting systems.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-192  It could find and hit targets day or night in any weather...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-193  ...and carried a 6.5 ton bomb load.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-194  In poor conditions, a pair of Intruders could destroy a target...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-195  ...that a normal raid of 100 aircraft might fail to hit.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-196  SURVIVAL  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-197  More than a year after Rolling Thunder had begun...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-198  ...North Vietnam's leaders were gaining confidence.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-199  The bombing had unified the North Vietnamese people.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-200  Damaged railway stock tracks, and industrial equipment...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-201  ...were being replaced by the Soviet Union and China.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-202  Almost every day, a supply ship arrived in Haiphong harbor.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-203  The Soviet Union had also supplied new advanced fighter aircraft  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-204  ...bringing the number of North Vietnamese planes to 70.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-205  The Mig 21, all weather interceptor, was able to fly...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-206  ...at twice the speed of sound and was highly maneuverable.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-207  It was armed with two cannon and two Atoll infrared homing missiles  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-208  ...deadly weapons at medium ranges.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-209  In spite of the American bombing, the North Vietnamese...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-210  ...had actually increased the flow of men and supplies...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-211  ...to the Southern battlefield.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-212  Destroyed bridges were bypassed by pontoons and fords...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-213  ...and trucks moved mostly at night.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-214  POL  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-215  For months the American Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-216  ...had been urging the president to launch an all out campaign...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-217  ...against North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-218  Above all, they wanted to target petroleum and oil storage, the POL system.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-219  U.S. commanders were confident that an offensive against POL targets...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-220  ...would deal a crippling blow to the North Vietnamese war effort.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-221  The offensive was put off again and again.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-222  President Johnson was waiting for an answer to a peace feeler sent out to Hanoi.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-223  When there was no response the president approved the attacks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-224  The first POL raids on North Vietnam's fuel storage system...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-225  ...were launched on June 29th 1966.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-226  North Vietnam had 13 major oil storage facilities.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-227  Two had already been destroyed and another badly damaged.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-228  The new American campaign was launched...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-229  ...by USAF planes flying from Thailand  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-230  ...and by the Navy carriers Ranger, Constellation and Hancock.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-231  In the first strikes, tanks at Hanoi, Haiphong and Don Son were hit.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-232  The following day saw attacks on yet more sites.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-233  The remaining facilities and fuel carrying trains from China were next.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-234  The American attacks were completely devastating.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-235  The North's biggest facility at Haiphong was totally destroyed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-236  Smoke from the burning tanks reached 20,000 feet into the sky.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-237  The POL strikes lasted for several weeks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-238  76% of the designated oil facility targets...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-239  ...in North Vietnam's main storage and pumping facilities were wrecked.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-240  So were half the barges used to ferry oil from tankers offshore.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-241  The reaction from North Vietnam's air defenses was furious.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-242  SAMs and anti aircraft guns were reinforced as the raids went on.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-243  The Migs flying from airfields still off-limits to U.S. bombs...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-244  ...could attack at will.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-245  American losses were heavy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-246  In spite of the massive size of the POL campaign...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-247  ...and the heavy cost in downed aircraft  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-248  ...the American raids had a limited effect.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-249  The big oil tanks had been destroyed, but long before...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-250  ...the North had dispersed the stocks to smaller tanks and bunkers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-251  Some had been hidden in residential districts  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-252  ...places the Americans might avoid attacking.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-253  The Americans launched a massive effort to try and eliminate...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-254  ...the dispersed oil stocks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-255  After heavy losses of planes and men they had destroyed only a fraction.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-256  North Vietnam still had more than enough to supply its own needs...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-257  ...and the needs of the trucks supplying the Southern battlefield.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-258  DIVISION  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-259  In October, 1966 the U.S. defense secretary, Robert McNamara...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-260  paid a visit to the American carrier fleet off the shores of North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-261  With him was General Wheeler the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-262  and Admiral Sharp the Pacific Fleet commander.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-263  Over the past few months McNamara had grown more and more disillusioned...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-264  ...with the Rolling Thunder campaign.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-265  The North Vietnamese still showed no signs of abandoning the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-266  The failure of the POL offensive had been the final straw.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-267  By now, the cost of Rolling Thunder had soared...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-268  ...to 1 billion 247 million dollars...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-269  ...and more aircraft and crew lost every month.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-270  McNamara now favored curtailing the bombing.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-271  He argued that U.S. aircraft should concentrate on attacking...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-272  ...the supply routes from North Vietnam to the South  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-273  ...at a much lower cost in lives and cash.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-274  Military leaders were dismayed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-275  Their argument was that Rolling Thunder had failed because...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-276  ...with all the restrictions, it had never been given a chance to succeed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-277  SEA DRAGON  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-278  During 1966 as operation Rolling Thunder intensified  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-279  American and Australian warships joined...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-280  ...in the campaign against North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-281  Operation Sea Dragon attacked more than 3,500 land targets...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-282  including bridges railroad yards and truck parks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-283  More than 300 coastal defense and radar installations were damaged or destroyed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-284  The attacks were fiercely resisted...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-285  ...by North Vietnamese coastal artillery batteries.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-286  During the two years of Sea Dragon attacks the guns would hit 19 ships  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-287  none were sunk but several suffered serious damage.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-288  In early February 1967, President Johnson declared a six day halt...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-289  ...in attacks on North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-290  The North Vietnamese immediately raced supplies and men to the South...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-291  ...as they had done during every pause before.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-292  Ho Chi Minh replied to Johnson's offer of negotiations...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-293  ...with the demand that the bombing stopped completely.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-294  Ho made no promise that even then he would talk.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-295  Ho's rebuff left Johnson frustrated and angry.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-296  It was now a contest of wills.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-297  To increase the pressure on North Vietnam Johnson sanctioned attacks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-298  ...on a new list of bombing targets.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-299  American planes would attack the North's airfields, power plants and industries...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-300  while the Navy's operation Sea Dragon would be expanded.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-301  It was a major step towards an all out campaign.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-302  The U.S. and Australian warships of Operation Sea Dragon...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-303  ...were allowed to extend operations from 19 to 20 degrees North.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-304  Aircraft were sent to mine river mouths and later inland waterways as well...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-305  ...up to the same line.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-306  Haiphong harbor, however the North's most important port...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-307  would not be mined until 1972 to avoid the risk of sinking Soviet ships.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-308  The New targets for U.S. bombers were the air fields  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-309  ...power plants and industries of the Northeastern quadrant.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-310  Some targets were inside the previously prohibited zones...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-311  ...around Hanoi and Haiphong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-312  The American attacks on North Vietnam's airfields began on April 24th 1967.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-313  By the end of the year, all but one of the North's Mig bases had been hit.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-314  The attacks inflicted heavy damage on runways and installations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-315  There were furious air combats over Hanoi and Haiphong...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-316  ...as every available Mig was thrown into action.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-317  After the air field attacks came the strikes on industrial targets  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-318  ...and power plants.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-319  32% of the North's electrical power generating capacity was cut  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-320  but the remaining plants were adequate to supply...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-321  ...most of the North's small industrial plants.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-322  By now the weather had improved and the bombers now ranged freely...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-323  ...hitting old and new targets again and again.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-324  In May 1967, as desperate battles raged in the skies over Hanoi and Haiphong  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-325  the Americans shot down 26 North Vietnamese fighters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-326  North Vietnam's pilot strength had been halved.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-327  ESCALATION  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-328  While the latest offensive against North Vietnam was still underway  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-329  in Washington a bitter argument was raging about strategy in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-330  President Johnson's civilian and military advisors...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-331  ...were now completely at odds.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-332  The military wanted a major escalation of the ground and air war...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-333  ...in an all out push for victory.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-334  The civilians, especially Robert McNamara  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-335  ...were calling for the war effort to be leveled off.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-336  In August 1967 the pressure on President Johnson...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-337  ...to side with his military commanders sharply increased.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-338  A senate subcommittee was about to call for much heavier bombing of North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-339  To head off criticism, Johnson approved a sharp escalation in Rolling Thunder.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-340  For the defense secretary, Robert McNamara  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-341  the decision to escalate was the end of the road.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-342  His advice had been ignored...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-343  ...and plainly he no longer had the confidence of the President.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-344  McNamara had no option but to resign.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-345  American aircraft now hit a whole list of previously banned targets  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-346  ...including power plants and rail yards inside the Hanoi circle.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-347  The Paul Du Mer bridge linking Hanoi and Haiphong was attacked...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-348  ...and two of its spans dropped into the Red River.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-349  However engineers hastily carried out temporary repairs...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-350  and the bridge continued to carry traffic until it was hit again in October 1967.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-351  Targets inside the Chinese border buffer zone were also hit.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-352  American planes attacked to within 8 miles of the frontier.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-353  Two American aircraft strayed into China and were shot down by Chinese Migs.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-354  The attacks of late 1967 were so intense that, for a time  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-355  the Northern air defenses ran desperately short of SAMs and anti aircraft ammunition.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-356  Almost all important targets except Haiphong port...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-357  ...had been hit repeatedly.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-358  The Americans were now using a new generation of smart bombs...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-359  ...including the Walleye television guided weapon...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-360  ...which had been operational in Vietnam since 1966.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-361  It took many fewer aircraft to destroy a target, which meant in theory...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-362  ...that precision attacks could be made even in densely populated areas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-363  There was little the North Vietnamese air defenses could do to stop the havoc.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-364  However, Northern leaders still had no intention of giving in to U.S. demands.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-365  In their view, the best way of  stopping the bombing...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-366  ...was to win the war in the South in the shortest possible time.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-367  TET  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-368  In January 1968, 84,000 NLF and North Vietnamese Army troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-369  ...launched their long planned Tet offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-370  They attacked towns and cities all over South Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-371  ...and held huge tracts of Saigon, the capital, for weeks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-372  In the end, the Tet offensive was a military disaster for the Vietcong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-373  40,000 were killed in more than a month of savage fighting.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-374  However, in a way that had never been planned  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-375  ...the offensive was a political triumph.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-376  In the United States public opinion had been...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-377  ...turning against the war for months.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-378  The sheer scale of the latest offensive now seemed to confirm...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-379  ...that the U.S. strategy had failed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-380  The pressure on President Johnson to look for a negotiated settlement grew irresistible  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-381  On March 31st 1968 Johnson announced that, as a goodwill gesture  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-382  he was restricting the bombing campaign to the extreme South or North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-383  On April 3rd Hanoi Radio announced that if bombing ceased unconditionally...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-384  ...the talks could begin.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-385  The Paris peace process began on march 10th 1968.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-386  Almost at once they stalled hopelessly.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-387  Meantime U.S. aircraft and warships continued to attack...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-388  ...transportation targets below the 20th parallel.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-389  In October 1968 after several months of wrangling...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-390  ...and on the eve of U.S. presidential elections, there was a breakthrough.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-391  The North Vietnamese agreed that in exchange for a complete halt of the bombing...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-392  ...they for their part would no longer infiltrate troops across the DMZ...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-393  ...or shell major cities in the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-394  Johnson knew that being seen to oppose peace...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-395  ...could damage his party's chances in the coming elections.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-396  Reluctantly, he agreed to stop the bombing.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-397  Operation Rolling Thunder came to an end on November 1st 1968...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-398  ...after three and a half years.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-399  The campaign had cost more than 900 American aircraft.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-400  818 pilots were dead or missing and hundreds were in captivity.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-401  On the Northern side nearly 120 North Vietnamese planes...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-402  ...had been destroyed in air combat in accidents, or by friendly fire.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-403  On the ground according to McNamara's estimates...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-404  182,000 civilians had been killed during operation Rolling Thunder.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-405  20,000 Chinese support personnel had also been casualties of the bombing.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-406  LAOS  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-407  With the end of Rolling Thunder North Vietnam immediately...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-408  ...set about rebuilding its shattered transport system.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-409  In spite of the talks still going on in Paris, the Northern commander  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-410  General Giap, was already planning his next offensive in the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-411  He sharply increased the flow of supplies and men down the Ho Chi Minh trail.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-412  With thousands of U.S. aircraft and pilots...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-413  ...no longer tied up attacking North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-414  U.S. commanders could concentrate massive air power on Laos.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-415  The main aim was to find and destroy the truck convoys moving South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-416  Special forces teams had always scouted into Laos...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-417  ...to guide attack aircraft onto targets.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-418  But by this time the U.S. had also deployed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-419  ...the world's most sophisticated electronic surveillance system.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-420  Between 1966 and 1971 in Operation Igloo White  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-421  American aircraft laid a sophisticated system of electronic sensors...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-422  ...down the Ho Chi Minh trail in Laos.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-423  The targets were the truck convoys streaming South from North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-424  Signals from the sensors were picked up by orbiting aircraft...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-425  ...and relayed to a listening center in Nakhon Phanom in Thailand.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-426  Other aircraft carried instruments to detect...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-427  ...the electrical activity of truck engines.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-428  When a convoy was detected the Americans would launch a raid...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-429  ...by B-52s or fighter bombers into the target area.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-430  In 1968 alone, U.S. strike aircraft flew 88,000 strikes against targets in Laos.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-431  The planes dropped high explosives cluster bombs and mines.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-432  They were also equipped with new highly accurate laser guided bombs.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-433  In the front line of the war against the trucks  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-434  the formidable gunships known as Spooky played a vital part.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-435  The gunships carried three mini guns each able to fire 6,000 rounds a minute.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-436  Flying in a circular pattern over the target  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-437  the gunship would rain down an awesome weight of fire.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-438  In 1969 the gunships alone claimed more than 10,000 trucks destroyed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-439  However, the North Vietnamese had built 400 miles of new roads in Laos...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-440  ...and not even American electronics and computers could cover it all.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-441  Still, U.S. aircraft would drop three quarters of a million tons of bombs on Laos  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-442  ...10 times the weight dropped on Japan in World War II.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-443  VIETNAMISATION  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-444  In January 1969 Richard Nixon took office...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-445  ...as the new President of the United States.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-446  Nixon had promised to achieve what he called 'Peace with Honor'.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-447  The aim was to negotiate a settlement that would allow...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-448  ...the half million U.S. troops in Vietnam to be withdrawn...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-449  ...while still allowing South Vietnam to survive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-450  The American plan was to prepare the South Vietnamese to take over their own defense.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-451  Officials called it Vietnamisation.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-452  The regular armed forces would be built up to over 420,000 men.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-453  They would get modern weapons including large numbers of tanks, guns and aircraft.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-454  The North's strategy for 1969 was to keep up the pressure on South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-455  While negotiations were going on...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-456  ...they meant to improve their position on the battlefield.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-457  On the 22nd of February 1969 in a major offensive  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-458  assault teams and artillery attacked American bases all over South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-459  ...killing 1,140 Americans.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-460  At the same time in an echo of Tet a year earlier  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-461  ...100 towns and cities were hit.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-462  The American reaction was swift.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-463  Arc Light strikes by B-52s were launched on guerrilla base areas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-464  Armor piercing bombs dropped from 30,000 feet...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-465  ...annihilated bunker and tunnel complexes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-466  On the ground, American units launched spoiling attacks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-467  ...on guerrilla staging areas and captured enormous quantities of supplies.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-468  The heaviest fighting was around the capital Saigon...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-469  ...but fights raged all over South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-470  In the first three weeks of battles the Americans lost 1,100 men.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-471  However, American artillery and air power overwhelmed the Vietcong offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-472  OPERATION MENU  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-473  In the White House there was anger and deep frustration...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-474  ...at the latest campaign against South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-475  President Nixon and his advisors were determined to retaliate...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-476  ...to show that the U.S. was serious about defending its ally.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-477  The problem was that going back to bombing North Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-478  ...would cause an outcry in the United States.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-479  Nixon's plan was to bomb Vietcong staging areas in Cambodia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-480  For years they had been the springboards for attacks against Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-481  These jungle areas held tens of thousands of troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-482  ...and vast stores of supplies and weapons.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-483  But Washington had forbidden U.S. forces to attack the Cambodian bases.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-484  Legally Cambodia was a neutral state and there was a risk...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-485  ...that American action could draw Cambodia into the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-486  However Nixon did not mean to hold back.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-487  Operation Menu, the bombing of Cambodia  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-488  ...was to be kept strictly guarded secret.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-489  It was dubbed Menu because the first attack on base area 354...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-490  ...had been decided at a breakfast briefing at the Pentagon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-491  The operation was to continue for 14 months.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-492  As well as the Ho Chi Minh trail running from North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-493  ...NVA forces were also supplied by North Vietnamese and Soviet Ships...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-494  ...which were allowed to dock at Sihanoukville.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-495  From here they fed war materials to the main base areas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-496  The biggest Vietcong strongholds were West and North of Saigon...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-497  ...in the areas known as Parrot's Beak and the Fish Hook.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-498  The bases were run by North Vietnamese troops and the NLF.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-499  Starting in February 1969 American B-52 bombers from Thailand...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-500  ...launched devastating strikes against each of the base areas in turn.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-501  Operation Menu saw more than 4,000 B-52 missions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-502  ...dropping 120,000 tons of bombs.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-503  In later campaigns B-52s supported...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-504  ...American and South Vietnamese ground incursions into Cambodia  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-505  and backed the Cambodian government forces against the Khmer Rouge guerrillas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-506  Altogether in four years of bombing U.S. aircraft would unload...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-507  ...more than half a million tons of bombs on Cambodia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-508  On orders from the White House extraordinary measures were taken...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-509  ...to keep the Cambodian bombing a secret.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-510  Defense department officials always claimed the raids were over South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-511  Because the planes were guided to their target by radar at the Bien Hoa air bases  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-512  ...and orders to drop the bombs were also issued from there  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-513  often the pilots themselves did not know they were bombing Cambodia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-514  Those that did were ordered to falsify their flight logs...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-515  ...upon returning to base to maintain the secrecy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-516  In spite of the elaborate precautions, in May 1969  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-517  ...reports of the secret bombing were published in the American press.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-518  Nixon was furious.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-519  Only recently, the American public had learned about the My Lai massacre...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-520  ...in which over 200 South Vietnamese villagers had been killed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-521  ...by U.S. troops back in 1968.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-522  Anti war feeling had also been fueled by news...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-523  ...of the bloody battle of Hamburger Hill.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-524  American troops had suffered heavy casualties capturing the hill...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-525  ...only for it to be abandoned later.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-526  THE PULL-OUT  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-527  On June 8th 1969 President Nixon met...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-528  ...with South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-529  ...on Midway island in the Pacific.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-530  Nixon announced that 25,000 U.S. troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-531  ...would be withdrawn from Vietnam immediately.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-532  The 9th Marines would be the first to head for home.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-533  It was the first U.S. troop reduction in the history of the war in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-534  By the fall of 1969 Nixon's initiatives had succeeded...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-535  ...in quietening public opposition to the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-536  To keep up the momentum the President announced...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-537  ...a second batch of troop withdrawals...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-538  ...and promised to reduce the draft call.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-539  In October 1969 an opinion poll gave Nixon an approval rating of 71%  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-540  ...an almost unprecedented figure.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-541  Although Nixon was preparing to pull out American troops  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-542  ...he had no intention of giving up on Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-543  His plan was that even when most American troops had been withdrawn...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-544  ...Americans would continue to supply train and arm the South Vietnamese.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-545  Most important of all, a formidable shield of American air power would remain...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-546  ...to deter communist attacks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-547  As ground combat in South Vietnam fell to its lowest level in six years  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-548  ...the prospects for success looked increasingly good in Washington.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-549  What U.S. officials did not know was that in North Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-550  ...the greatest offensive of the whole war was being prepared.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-551  The plan was to use nearly 200,000 troops and hundreds of tanks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN10-552  ...in a full scale invasion of South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-1  BATTLEFIELD VIETNAM  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-2  Peace with Honor  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-3  Between 1972 and 1975 the armies of North and South Vietnam clashed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-4  ...in some of the greatest battles of the Vietnam war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-5  Twice in three years the government of the North launched...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-6  ...full scale attacks against the American-backed South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-7  What had been a war of hit and run and ambush...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-8  ...became one of huge set piece engagements between conventional armies.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-9  The South Vietnamese Army backed by American air power  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-10  ...repelled the North's first onslaught.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-11  Over North Vietnam the heaviest air strikes of the war...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-12  ...came close to bringing the country to its knees.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-13  But the North's second great offensive proved unstoppable.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-14  The American strategy had been to arm and train the South Vietnamese...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-15  ...to defend themselves.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-16  American combat troops had gone.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-17  For South Vietnam the result was catastrophe.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-18  In a fierce campaign lasting four months  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-19  North Vietnamese tanks smashed their way to the gates of Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-20  PRELUDE TO THE BATTLE  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-21  Hanoi's strategy for 1969 was to keep up the pressure on South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-22  While negotiations were going on in Paris...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-23  ...they meant to improve their position on the battlefield.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-24  Half a million American troops were now deployed in the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-25  In February 1969, in an echo of the Tet offensive the previous year...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-26  ...their bases were the targets of a major Vietcong offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-27  1,140 Americans died.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-28  The newly inaugurated president, Richard Nixon  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-29  and his national security advisor, Henry Kissinger  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-30  ...immediately ordered retaliation.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-31  American B-52 bombers dropped half a million tons of bombs...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-32  ...on Vietcong base areas along the Vietnam Cambodia border...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-33  ...in a secret campaign codenamed “Menu”.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-34  Congress was not informed and the flight logs and target destinations...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-35  ...were falsified to hide the fact that the bombs were falling on Cambodia  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-36  ...a neutral country.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-37  At the same time U.S. and South Vietnamese troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-38  ...began to advance towards the Cambodian border.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-39  The Vietcong offensive of Spring, 1969 had been launched...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-40  ...by four divisions made up mostly of North Vietnamese Army units.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-41  After bitter fighting the NVA battalions pulled back.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-42  Only local NLF battalions were left behind and those were ordered...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-43  ...to break down into smaller groups.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-44  In turn, big American units were also broken down...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-45  ...and spread out over a wider area of countryside.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-46  Increasingly, American forces were paired with the South Vietnamese Army...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-47  ...for operations in the most heavily populated areas of South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-48  In April 1969 a gruesome benchmark was reached...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-49  ...that added to the pressure for Vietnamisation.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-50  U.S. combat deaths surpassed the 33,629 men killed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-51  ...throughout the Korean war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-52  Increasingly the U.S. felt that it had to insure the South Vietnamese Army...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-53  ...would take control of the war for themselves.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-54  The American plan was to help the South Vietnamese government...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-55  ...regain control over vast areas of the countryside.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-56  The populated areas were swamped with patrols...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-57  ...trying to find an increasingly elusive enemy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-58  Often the aim was to draw the Vietcong into attacking a small unit...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-59  ...and then hit back with massive air strikes...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-60  ...and attacks by helicopter gunships.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-61  The new kind of war being fought in and around the villages...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-62  ...was enormously destructive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-63  American firepower caused heavy civilian casualties and widespread damage.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-64  For the NLF guerrillas, the second half of 1969 was a nightmarish ordeal.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-65  In less than two years their casualties had been more than 70% in many areas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-66  Food was desperately short as support from the villages faded away...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-67  ...and American patrols interfered with supplies.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-68  Meanwhile, the Phoenix program, a campaign run by the Central Intelligence Agency...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-69  and staffed by American and South Vietnamese soldiers  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-70  ...killed up to 40,000 people suspected of being NLF sympathizers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-71  Thousands more were tortured and imprisoned.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-72  In that year, desertions from the NLF and NVA were over 28,000  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-73  However, morale in the South Vietnamese Army was no better...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-74  with the number of desertions reaching almost a 100 in 10,000.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-75  While South Vietnamese government forces fought...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-76  ...to rest control of the villages from the NLF  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-77  American planners turned their attention to Cambodia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-78  Already the secret bombing campaign ordered by the American president...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-79  Richard Nixon, was well underway.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-80  Up to now, American ground forces had been banned...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-81  ...from mounting operations into Cambodia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-82  The country was legally neutral and its leader since the 1950's...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-83  ...the flamboyant prince Sihanouk had played both sides.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-84  Sometimes an ally of the Americans, he also allowed the NVA...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-85  ...to route the Southern part of the Ho Chi Minh trail through his kingdom...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-86  ...and maintain their base areas along the heavily jungled...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-87  ...Eastern border with Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-88  Then, in March 1970, there was a CIA backed coup to oust Sihanouk.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-89  The new government led by Lon Nol immediately moved...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-90  to eject all Vietcong and North Vietnamese troops from Cambodian soil.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-91  Operations by the Americans and the South Vietnamese would follow.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-92  The Vietcong base areas inside Cambodia were attacked from the west...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-93  ...by the Royal Cambodian Army.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-94  North Vietnam quickly diverted army units to defend them  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-95  and with the help of the Cambodian guerrillas, the Khmer Rouge  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-96  they halted the Cambodian government advance.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-97  Meanwhile the Americans and the South Vietnamese had deployed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-98  ...powerful forces on their side of the border.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-99  On April 29th 1970, South Vietnamese troops attacked into Cambodia  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-100  pushing towards the Vietcong bases.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-101  Two days later, the U.S. force of 30,000...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-102  ...including elements of three U.S. divisions, mounted a second attack.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-103  The next target was a base area in the Se Sam Valley.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-104  Soon after, more assaults were mounted further South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-105  Operations in Cambodia lasted for 60 days.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-106  American and South Vietnamese troops uncovered vast jungle supply depots...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-107  they captured 28,500 weapons as well as over 16 million rounds...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-108  of small arms ammunition and 14 million pounds of rice.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-109  Although most Vietcong troops had managed to escape across the Mekong  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-110  ...there were over 10,000 NVA and NLF casualties.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-111  However, when the South Vietnamese commander was killed in a helicopter crash  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-112  ...his forces withdrew.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-113  When news of the Cambodian incursion broke in the United States...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-114  ...there was public outcry.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-115  Many believed that in spite of President Nixon's promises to get out of Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-116  ...he meant to expand the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-117  Protests erupted in universities all over the country.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-118  On May 4th 1970 at Kent State University in Ohio  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-119  ...National Guardsmen shot four students dead.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-120  The deep divisions about the U.S. role in Southeast Asia...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-121  ...were having a powerful effect on American troops in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-122  Opinions about the war were divided sometimes bitterly, as they were at home.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-123  Added to the conflict were growing tensions between the races...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-124  ...and between social classes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-125  It was a volatile and sometimes dangerous mix.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-126  By now, there were few career sergeants and officers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-127  ...still to serve their tours in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-128  Much of the burden of maintaining discipline was falling on newly promoted...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-129  ...and often inexperienced leaders.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-130  Between 1969 and 1971 the U.S. army would record...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-131  ...more than 700 attacks by troops on their officers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-132  83 officers were killed and almost 650 were injured.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-133  Many attacks were by fragmentation grenades rolled into the victim's tent  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-134  ...a practice known as 'fragging'.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-135  The whole discipline problem was aggravated by widespread drug abuse.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-136  In 1971 fewer than 5,000 soldiers needed hospital treatment for combat wounds...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-137  ...but more than 20,500 were treated for serious drug abuse.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-138  By this time it was plain to most soldiers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-139  ...that the United States would pull out of Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-140  100,000 troops had been withdrawn and Nixon had promised...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-141  ...another 150,000 would leave within a year.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-142  No one wanted to be the last American soldier to die in Southeast Asia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-143  By the end of 1970, North Vietnam had replaced many of the losses...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-144  ...suffered in the fighting of the previous year.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-145  Their leaders were intent on launching a new campaign...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-146  ...and floods of men and supplies were being sent down the Ho Chi Minh trail...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-147  ...through Laos and Cambodia to South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-148  The build up was soon detected by the Americans.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-149  U.S. commanders begged for permission to attack into Laos...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-150  and once and for all destroy the supply lines down the Ho Chi Minh trail.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-151  Their hopes were quickly dashed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-152  The U.S. congress banned any American ground operations...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-153  ...beyond the borders of South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-154  This time, Saigon's forces would have to go it alone.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-155  If successful, the administration argued, they would gain two years...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-156  ...in which to build the South Vietnamese Army.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-157  The South Vietnamese attack into Laos was codenamed Operation Lam Son 719.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-158  The offensive opened with the U.S. Army 24th corps...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-159  ...clearing route 9 to Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-160  On February 8th 1971, three South Vietnamese Army divisions  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-161  about 17,000 men, supported by armor and a Ranger group...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-162  ...attacked across the border.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-163  However they were advancing into an NVA trap  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-164  ...carefully planned and with well coordinated defenses.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-165  The targets were two major North Vietnamese Army bases  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-166  known as 611 and 604.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-167  They were defended by over 40,000 combat troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-168  The South Vietnamese had established a series of fire bases...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-169  ...to protect their flanks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-170  The NVA launched fierce counterattacks against these bases...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-171  ...and the main advance with T-54 tanks, employed for the first time  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-172  ...and 130mm guns.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-173  Other NVA units moved to cut route 9 trying to encircle the invading column.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-174  Two South Vietnamese battalions were eventually airlifted in to Tchepone.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-175  President Thieu assumed command of what became a disastrous operation  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-176  ...and on March 8th he ordered a retreat.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-177  It became a rout.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-178  More than 9,000 Southern troops were killed or wounded.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-179  They lost 2/3 of their armored vehicles  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-180  and large numbers of helicopters and planes were destroyed or damaged.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-181  A crucial test of the South Vietnamese Army's ability to fight...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-182  ...without American support had ended in humiliation.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-183  Although the North Vietnamese had crushed the Southern offensive  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-184  ...they too had suffered casualties.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-185  Defending their bases in Laos and in Cambodia the year before...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-186  ...had cost thousands of dead and many vehicles and guns destroyed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-187  Vietcong units were now ordered to avoid major actions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-188  ...while they rebuilt their strength.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-189  THE LEADERS – North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-190  Since the death of Ho Chi Minh in September 1969  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-191  Prime Minister Pham Van Dong...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-192  Le Duan, the communist party leader...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-193  ...and General Giap, the defense minister...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-194  ...were determined not to abandon Ho's legacy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-195  The struggle to reunite North and South Vietnam would go on whatever the cost.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-196  Since the Americans had begun to withdraw troops from the South  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-197  Northern leaders had been faced with a dilemma:  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-198  Should the North wait to mount another major offensive...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-199  ...until after the Americans had gone or should it keep up the momentum?  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-200  In May 1971 the politburo instructed General Giap to prepare a new campaign.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-201  For some time the North's strategy had been to fight...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-202  ...and negotiate at the same time.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-203  Talks with the Americans and the South Vietnamese had been going on in Paris...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-204  ...but there was no progress.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-205  Northern leaders now believed that a victory on the battlefield...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-206  ...might break the stalemate.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-207  At the very least it could prove to the Americans...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-208  ...that their policy of Vietnamisation was not going to save the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-209  THE LEADERS – United States / South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-210  Although the U.S. President Richard Nixon, believed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-211  ...that Vietnam was damaging the United States at home and abroad...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-212  ...he was not prepared to make peace at any price.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-213  Nixon feared a climb down would dangerously weaken...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-214  ...America's credibility as an ally in the eyes of the world.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-215  South Vietnam had to survive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-216  As well as the formal peace negotiations in Paris...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-217  there were also secret meetings between Henry Kissinger...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-218  ...Nixon's national security advisor and the North Vietnamese.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-219  Those talks too had stalled...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-220  ...mainly over the future of the South Vietnamese government.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-221  The North was insisting that president Nguyen Van Thieu be replaced...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-222  ...and that the new government include the NLF.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-223  As for Thieu himself, his great fear was that to end the war...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-224  ...Nixon meant to do a separate deal with Hanoi.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-225  In fact, Nixon and his advisor Henry Kissinger were looking...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-226  ...not to North Vietnam but to Moscow and Beiging.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-227  Nixon's hope was that the Chinese or the Russians...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-228  ...would put pressure on the North Vietnamese to compromise.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-229  In February 1972 he embarked on the first visit...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-230  ...by an American president to communist China.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-231  Now that U.S. troops were withdrawing from Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-232  ...Chinese leader Mao Tse Tung increasingly favored an end to the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-233  He had already pressed Hanoi to step up the search for a solution.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-234  Neither Nixon nor his advisors were aware of it  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-235  but because of centuries of mistrust  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-236  North Vietnam had no intention of listening to the Chinese.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-237  STRATEGY – North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-238  As they planned their most ambitious offensive yet  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-239  North Vietnam's leaders knew they were taking a big gamble.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-240  There would still be U.S. troops in South Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-241  ...which could easily be reinforced.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-242  The question was Would the Americans send major combat units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-243  ...to save their South Vietnamese allies?  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-244  Northern planners decided that, in an American election year, they would not.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-245  The success of the coming campaign would depend...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-246  ...on assembling huge quantities of weapons and supplies.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-247  That meant more aid from both the Soviet Union and China.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-248  Although by now both superpowers were reluctant supporters of the war  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-249  neither was prepared to lose influence to the other.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-250  As a result, the North succeeded in getting increased arms deliveries...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-251  ...from both Moscow and Beijing.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-252  More than any offensive they had launched before  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-253  ...this one would depend on speed and mobility.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-254  For the North it would be a new kind of battle using tanks and artillery...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-255  ...to smash through enemy lines.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-256  The plan foresaw three major armored thrusts...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-257  ...slicing deep into South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-258  The first North Vietnamese attack would cross the Demilitarized Zone...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-259  ...separating North and South and push East from Laos.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-260  Two whole provinces and the cities of Quang Tri, Hue, and Da Nang would be captured.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-261  The second Thrust would attack through the Central Highlands...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-262  ...to the coast of Qui Nhon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-263  The third assault would strike from Cambodia and capture An Loc.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-264  There, a provisional revolutionary government would be established for the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-265  If resistance was still light units would press on...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-266  ...and capture the capital, Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-267  North Vietnamese Commanders knew that attacking the South...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-268  ...in three different places was a risky plan.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-269  In none of the attacks would they have...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-270  ...an overwhelming superiority of troops over the enemy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-271  However, General Giap believed that multiple thrusts...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-272  ...would keep the South guessing about what might come next.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-273  Southern units would be forced to stay on the defensive, isolated and scattered.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-274  Giap could then defeat them division by division.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-275  Northern leaders calculated that even limited success...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-276  ...would leave the NVA in control of large areas of South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-277  The NLF would then be able to reestablish political control over the countryside.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-278  Such gains would be a serious challenge to the Saigon government.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-279  At the same time, the North's bargaining position...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-280  ...in future negotiations would be improved dramatically.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-281  STRATEGY – United States / South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-282  By January 1st 1972 only 133,000 U.S. servicemen...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-283  ...remained in South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-284  2/3 of American troops had gone in two years.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-285  Australian and New Zealand contingents were also about to leave...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-286  ...and South Korean forces had already begun to return home.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-287  The ground war now almost exclusively...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-288  ...the province of the South Vietnamese Army.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-289  As Vietnamisation had gone on U.S. field commanders...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-290  had been under orders from Washington to keep American casualties down.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-291  Most operations were now defensive, designed to protect...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-292  ...U.S. bases from mortar and rocket attacks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-293  American air power was also being used in a different way.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-294  Fighter bombers were still mounting vigorous attacks on the Ho Chi Minh trail in Laos.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-295  More than 70,000 sorties in 1971.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-296  But American air activity in South Vietnam had fallen dramatically.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-297  There, the South Vietnamese Air Force was expected to look after...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-298  ...most ground support operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-299  South Vietnam's strategy for defending against attack...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-300  ...had been devised by President Thieu himself.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-301  Thieu believed that any foothold won by the Vietcong...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-302  would seriously threaten his bargaining position in the Paris peace talks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-303  As a result he was determined to defend all of South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-304  The only orders he issued to the South Vietnamese Army...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-305  ...were to hold on to every scrap of territory.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-306  The front line of the South Vietnamese Army's defense...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-307  ...was a string of forts and outposts along the borders.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-308  Behind the forts were the Army divisions but each was responsible only...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-309  ...for the defense of territory around its own base.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-310  The South's Joint General Staff also had a reserve of airborne and Marine troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-311  ...to act as a fire brigade in the event of an attack.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-312  The defense would be backed up by American strike aircraft  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-313  U.S. carriers in the Gulf of Tonkin  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-314  ...and B-52 bombers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-315  For years, the United States had pressed president Thieu...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-316  to improve the lot of the South Vietnamese people. Only then, the argument went  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-317  ...could support for the NLF in the countryside be undermined.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-318  By early 1972, Thieu had begun to introduce...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-319  ...some of the reforms the Americans had wanted.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-320  Thieu introduced a program to give peasants ownership of the land they tilled.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-321  A school was established to train local headmen...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-322  ...to administer their villages.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-323  Recruitment to local self defense militias was stepped up.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-324  Thieu's hollow boast was that 97% of all hamlets and villages...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-325  ...in the South were under government control.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-326  THE OPPOSING FORCES – North Vietnam / Vietcong  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-327  By the eve of the planned offensive named operation Nguyen Hue...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-328  ...after a eighteenth century national hero  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-329  the North Vietnamese Army had been transformed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-330  It now had fully equipped armored regiments.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-331  Artillery forces had been strengthened.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-332  From weapons to radios all the front line divisions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-333  ...were better equipped than ever before.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-334  The port of Haiphong was still jammed with Soviet shipping...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-335  ...delivering military supplies.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-336  With the American bombing of North Vietnam long over...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-337  trains loaded with troops, tanks and field guns could move with no risk from attack.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-338  The North Vietnamese Air Force had more than 200 jet fighters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-339  which patrolled energetically over Southern North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-340  but they rarely flew over the supply trails in Laos...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-341  ...where American aircraft were most active  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-342  ...nor would they play any direct part in the planned offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-343  Instead, very large numbers of anti aircraft guns had been deployed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-344  ...to cover the supply lines and assembly areas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-345  Above the Demilitarized Zone General Giap deployed two divisions  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-346  including the elite 308th and three independent infantry regiments.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-347  The infantry were backed by tank artillery and sapper regiments.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-348  Another division was poised in Laos opposite the former U.S. base at Khe Sanh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-349  In the early months of 1972 the North Vietnamese infiltrated a division  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-350  supported by independent infantry regiments, into South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-351  Another two divisions were already on the coastal plain.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-352  More divisions were deployed on the western border.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-353  Further South, another formation threatened the Mekong delta.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-354  Until now, North Vietnam had been fighting an infantry war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-355  Its army in the field could maintain its operations...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-356  ...as long as food and ammunition lasted.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-357  The coming offensive would be very different.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-358  A modern, conventional battle of firepower and maneuver...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-359  ...would pose a full range of completely new problems.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-360  125,000 men now massing on South Vietnam's borders would be going into battle...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-361  ...alongside over 600 tanks  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-362  ...a bigger army than General Patton had commanded in WWII.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-363  The tanks would consume huge quantities of fuel and ammunition.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-364  The infantry would have to keep up with the armor...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-365  and that meant large numbers of trucks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-366  The battle would move fast, putting strains on the communication and command systems...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-367  ...unlike anything the army had met before.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-368  WEAPONS – North Vietnam / Vietcong  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-369  The main North Vietnamese Army tanks were the Soviet designed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-370  ...T-54 and T-72 and their Chinese copies.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-371  They were armed with a powerful 100mm gun and were highly robust vehicles  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-372  ...easy to maintain on the battlefield.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-373  Some units were also equipped with the WWII vintage T-34 tank.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-374  The T-34 was armed with an 85mm gun...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-375  ...and was even simpler to operate and look after.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-376  Like the T-55 it could fire either armor piercing or high explosive shells.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-377  The NVA also deployed a light tank, the PT-76.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-378  It was armed with a 76 mm gun and it was amphibious.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-379  The ability to cross rivers and canals would make it...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-380  ...a specially valuable weapon in the lowlands of South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-381  North Vietnamese artillery ranged from the superb Soviet made 130mm field gun...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-382  ...to rockets and mortars of every size.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-383  All infantry units had their own air defense artillery and machine guns.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-384  There were also specialist air defense units.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-385  THE TROOPS – North Vietnam / Vietcong  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-386  In 12 years of war in South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-387  Vietcong forces had suffered appalling losses.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-388  By early 1972, over 600,000 North Vietnamese Army troops and NLF had died.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-389  As well as those killed in battle, many thousand had perished from disease...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-390  ...and American air attacks on the long journey on the Ho Chi Minh trail.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-391  In North Vietnam a severe manpower shortage meant...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-392  ...the gaps in the NVA's ranks were not being filled.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-393  In the three months before the spring offensive  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-394  every male between the ages of 14 to 45 was called up.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-395  For the first time the ranks of draftees even included...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-396  ...the relatives of senior party officials.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-397  The NLF in South Vietnam was also suffering a manpower crisis.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-398  Saigon government troops and officials seemed to be everywhere...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-399  making it difficult for NLF recruiting teams to operate.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-400  Even the ranks of local guerrilla units were being boosted...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-401  ...by North Vietnamese regular troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-402  The Northerners faced a host of problems not least the lack of friends and relatives  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-403  ...to provide information food and a hiding place.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-404  The ever increasing dominance of the North Vietnamese over the NLF...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-405  ...was causing real tensions in Vietcong units.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-406  Many NLF members believed the North no longer saw them as equal partners.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-407  There was a growing fear that once Victory was achieved...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-408  ...Northerners would simply take over the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-409  In every unit political officers worked hard to ease friction...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-410  ...between NVA troops and their Southern comrades.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-411  THE OPPOSING FORCES – United States / South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-412  By January 1972, the armed forces of South Vietnam had grown...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-413  ...to over a million men.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-414  The American's Vietnamisation program was in full swing...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-415  ...with a massive equipment and training effort.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-416  The army's supply and logistics system was also being built up...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-417  ...to cope with a whole new scale of operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-418  Where once the South Vietnamese had been expected to get by on WWII surplus...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-419  ...the Americans were now providing advanced weaponry.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-420  The infantry got nearly a million M-16 rifles...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-421  ...and 20,000 machine guns.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-422  Heavy weapons included 400 new tanks and 200 Howitzers  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-423  while the Air Force was built up to 2,000 planes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-424  It would soon be the fourth largest air force in the world.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-425  Transforming the South Vietnamese Army...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-426  ...into a modern fighting military machine was not proving easy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-427  American tanks, helicopters and aircraft...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-428  ...arrived with their maintenance manuals in English.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-429  South Vietnamese personnel training to be technical specialists...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-430  ...had first to go through Language School.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-431  Most American advisors agreed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-432  ...that building up the South Vietnamese armed forces...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-433  ...into a credible defense was going to take more time than anyone had realized.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-434  South Vietnam was divided into four military regions  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-435  ...each the responsibility of an army Corp.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-436  Altogether the South fielded 11 infantry divisions and an airborne division...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-437  three Marine brigades  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-438  ...ten Ranger groups  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-439  ...and four brigades of tanks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-440  The Air Force deployed nine squadrons of combat aircraft  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-441  fourteen of helicopters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-442  ...and three air transport squadrons.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-443  U.S. Army combat forces were now down to a handful of units at Da Nang  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-444  ...around Saigon  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-445  ...and at Can Tho, in the delta.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-446  The Air Force also had two tactical fighter wings  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-447  ...a reconnaissance wing  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-448  ...and a B-52 wing in Thailand.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-449  The Navy carriers Hancock and Coral Sea...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-450  ...were still in Yankee Station on the gulf of Tonkin.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-451  By early 1972, many of the 133,000 U.S. ground troops in South Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-452  ...were occupied closing up bases and preparing to withdraw  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-453  but aviation units of the Army, Navy and Air Force were still operating  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-454  ...as were logistics and communications specialists.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-455  So were 1,400 Army and Marine advisors attached to South Vietnamese units.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-456  In spite of American protests most of the South Vietnamese Army's Infantry divisions  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-457  ...were static defense forces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-458  Their orders to hold territory at all costs  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-459  meant that they had little incentive to use their new armored vehicles and helicopters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-460  Nor were they developing the skills to fight fast moving offensive battles.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-461  Because the Army's Infantry divisions had their own territory to defend  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-462  ...they had grown increasingly settled.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-463  The divisional bases were soon surrounded by shanty towns...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-464  ...as soldiers' families set up home close by.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-465  Bribery could secure a permanent posting...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-466  ...and soldiers ordered to move sometimes refused.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-467  In 1971 alone over a 140,000 government soldiers deserted.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-468  WEAPONS – United States / South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-469  In the battles ahead Southern forces would be faced...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-470  ...with large North Vietnamese armored formations for the first time in the war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-471  For the infantry the main defense was the LAW or the Light Anti-tank Weapon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-472  It was a one shot disposable launcher...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-473  ...which fired a shaped charged rocket.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-474  It was already highly valued by the troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-475  ...for destroying bunkers and fortified positions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-476  It was the Americans who still had the most mobile and powerful anti tank defense.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-477  The TOW was a wire guided anti tank missile...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-478  ...often mounted on a helicopter gunship.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-479  It had a range of more than 3,000 meters and it was highly accurate.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-480  As long as the gunner kept its sight on the target  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-481  the weapon's computer system would insure a hit.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-482  The most effective helicopter gunship in American service was the Huey Cobra.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-483  It was a revolutionary design.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-484  The gunner sat in front with the pilot above and behind.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-485  The Cobra was fast, able to fly at over 200 miles per hour and highly maneuverable.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-486  It could carry a devastating array of weapons  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-487  many guns, automatic grenade launchers  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-488  a multi barrel 20mm cannon, and 76 rockets.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-489  American gunships and the South Vietnamese Air Forces attack planes...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-490  ...would provide most of the support for ground troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-491  However, vastly more destructive American air power...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-492  ...was always present in the background.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-493  B-52 bombers, some able to carry over 31 tons of bombs  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-494  were still attacking targets in Laos and Cambodia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-495  The Americans also had the most advanced supersonic strike aircraft in the world.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-496  he F-111 had a unique swing wing design.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-497  With the wings extended it could make low speed landings.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-498  In swept back configuration it could fly at 1,600 miles an hour.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-499  The F-111 had advanced computer navigation...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-500  ...and could bomb targets at night and in the worst weather.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-501  THE TROOPS – United States / South Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-502  Most major South Vietnamese Army units still had American military advisors.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-503  They were usually career soldiers  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-504  ...many on their second or even third tour of duty in Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-505  The main role of advisors to infantry units was to coordinate...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-506  ...the vast array of American fire power still on call.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-507  They also offered encouragement and tactical advice.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-508  In some units, the advisor's presence had an unforeseen drawback.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-509  Many South Vietnamese field commanders came to rely heavily...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-510  ...on the American's military skills.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-511  As the months went on and advisors were gradually withdrawn  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-512  large numbers of South Vietnamese officers would find themselves...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-513  ...unable to command on their own.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-514  For years, one of the biggest American complaints about their allies...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-515  ...was the way promotions were awarded in the South Vietnamese Army.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-516  Political patronage was rife.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-517  The social connections of senior officers were far more important...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-518  ...than their professional competence.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-519  There was one unexpected plus...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-520  ...in the way the South Vietnamese Army promotions worked.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-521  Officers lacking political influence could stay in combat units for years  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-522  as a result, by 1972 many of the South Vietnamese Army's front line formations...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-523  ...were led by highly experienced and battle hardened men.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-524  Amongst the many problems besetting the South Vietnamese armed forces  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-525  poor training was one of the worst.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-526  Army culture held training in contempt.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-527  When the military schools requested combat experienced instructors...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-528  ...most front line units unloaded their worst men.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-529  As a result, some training units failed to produce soldiers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-530  ...with even the most basic military skills.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-531  EVE OF BATTLE  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-532  President Nixon meant to follow his triumphant visit to China...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-533  ...by next going to Moscow.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-534  Hopes were high that relations between the world's great powers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-535  ...were entering a new era.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-536  In fact, events in Vietnam were about to threaten the whole plan.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-537  Since the American bombing of North Vietnam had ended in late 1968  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-538  U.S. reconnaissance activity had been intense.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-539  As well as conventional reconnaissance planes  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-540  the Americans deployed the Top Secret Blackbird.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-541  The SR-71 could fly at 2,000 miles an hour and operated 70,000 feet  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-542  ...well above anti aircraft defenses.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-543  By the opening weeks of 1972 reconnaissance pictures of Southern North Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-544  ...as well as the border areas of Laos and Cambodia...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-545  ...had shown a dramatic communist buildup.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-546  They photographed 7 to 8,000 trucks waiting in supply depots ready to go.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-547  The American response was to launch heavy air strikes...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-548  ...against the troop concentrations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-549  U.S. intelligence believed the North Vietnamese blow...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-550  ...would fall before the end of January 1972.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-551  when the month passed without incidents, Saigon relaxed its vigilance.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-552  Senior South Vietnamese officers hoped that the preemptive air strikes...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-553  ...and the increasing strength of the Army had forced the North to think twice.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-554  So confident were the Americans that the U.S. defense secretary  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-555  Melvin Laird, told congress that a major communist offensive...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-556  ...was not a serious possibility.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-557  Only five weeks later he would be proved shockingly wrong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-558  By late March 1972  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-559  in hundreds of North Vietnamese Army command posts and dugouts  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN11-560  ...the countdown had already begun.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-1  BATTLEFIELD VIETNAM  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-2  The Fall of Saigon  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-3  On March 30th 1972 mass North Vietnamese Army artillery...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-4  ...opened up in a shattering barrage.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-5  The targets for the guns and rockets were South Vietnamese positions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-6  ...across the Demilitarized Zone separating North and South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-7  As the guns blasted South Vietnamese defenses  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-8  upwards of 20,000 of Giap's troops and 200 of the 600 tanks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-9  ...waited in their jumping off positions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-10  At noon they searched forward as the South Vietnamese units fled in panic.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-11  Facing the Northern onslaught was a weak South Vietnamese infantry division...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-12  ...and a Marine brigade. Their 1,200 troops were scattered...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-13  ...across 13 combat bases and outposts.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-14  The enemy assault caught the Infantry division just as it was moving...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-15  ...its regiments from one position to another.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-16  The Southern defense was thrown into complete chaos.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-17  Intelligence reports had predicted a Northern attack...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-18  ...but no one had expected it to come on the Demilitarized Zone.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-19  After two days of confused fighting, on April 2nd  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-20  the South Vietnamese began to retreat to a new defensive line.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-21  The Northern offensive across the Demilitarized Zone...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-22  had forced the South Vietnamese to fall back to route 9 and the Cua Viet River.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-23  To the West the line was held by Camp Carroll  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-24  the Rockpile and the Mai Loc combat base.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-25  In two days these bases fell and the NVA pushed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-26  ...to within 10 miles of Quang Tri City.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-27  Further South, the city of Hue was threatened from two directions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-28  Facing the NVA were the South Vietnamese 1st Division, and a division of Marines.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-29  The attack opened on April 1st 1972.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-30  To the West the 324B division pushed Southern forces back in heavy fighting.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-31  For a time the defenders held a line from the My Chanh River...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-32  ...to Fire base Bastogne and old American outpost.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-33  But soon, even that line was being pushed back.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-34  The North Vietnamese attack on Quang Tri City...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-35  ...and the push towards Hue were furious assaults  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-36  ...but on April 9th after a few days of fighting  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-37  ...the NVA were forced to halt their attacks and resupply.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-38  Outside Quang Tri, the North's failure to keep up the pressure...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-39  ...saved the South Vietnamese defense from complete collapse.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-40  For the first few days of the Northern offensive, poor weather had prevented...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-41  ...full scale intervention by American aircraft.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-42  However, as the skies cleared, U.S. fighter bombers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-43  ...and helicopter gunships began pounding NVA positions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-44  They were joined by massive air reinforcements rushed to the region...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-45  ...including B-52's and four more Aircraft carriers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-46  Three days after the first North Vietnamese attack  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-47  in the far South of Vietnam there was another major thrust.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-48  This time, the assault was barely 50 miles from the Southern capital, Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-49  The South Vietnamese forces defending Saigon were the 18th Division  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-50  the 5th Division...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-51  ...and the 25th, along with three Ranger groups.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-52  On the North Vietnamese side, three divisions  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-53  at one time Southern Vietcong but now almost completely Northern...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-54  ...were backed by tanks and two independent infantry regiments.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-55  The North Vietnamese first launched a diversionary attack...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-56  ...towards Tay Ninh city overrunning South Vietnamese garrisons.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-57  In the main blow the 5th Division assaulted Loc Ninh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-58  In spite of intense American air support, the town fell.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-59  Meanwhile, the 7th cut route 13 and the 9th prepared to attack An Loc.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-60  At An Loc more than 12,000 North Vietnamese were besieging...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-61  ...less than 1,500 South Vietnamese Army troops.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-62  The town was surrounded and ripe for an immediate assault.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-63  NVA artillery was pounding the defenders.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-64  The assault of An Loc had been entrusted to the 9th division  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-65  but almost a week passed and the division still hadn't launched its attack.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-66  Supplies of ammunition, fuel and spare parts were arriving far too slowly...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-67  ...and their tanks became bogged down.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-68  During the hold up, American helicopters were ferrying men and supplies...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-69  ...into the threatened city.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-70  B-52 strikes hit the NVA assembly areas with devastating effect.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-71  The NVA finally mounted its assault on An Loc on April 13th 1972.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-72  At once American helicopter gunships pounced on the attackers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-73  In three days of mass infantry assaults spearheaded by tanks  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-74  North Vietnamese troops managed to seize the Northern part of the city  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-75  ...but they failed to break the defense.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-76  The 4,000 strong South Vietnamese force reinforced by elite airborne units...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-77  ...held their positions and launched furious counterattacks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-78  ...accompanied by renewed B-52 strikes.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-79  The carnage would continue until on May 15th, the Vietcong forces withdrew.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-80  In the Central Highlands the targets for two NVA divisions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-81  ...were the provincial capitals of Kontum and Pleiku.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-82  The defenders, the South Vietnamese 22nd division  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-83  fell back in disarray but were instantly reinforced...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-84  ...and they succeeded in holding the town.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-85  Meanwhile, the NVA seized control of most of Binh Dinh province  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-86  ...threatening to cut the country in two.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-87  On April 6th, Nixon ordered the resumption of full scale air strikes over the North...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-88  ...and Naval gun fire to support the beleaguered South Vietnamese.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-89  On April 27th, two weeks after the first North Vietnamese attack...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-90  ...on Quang Tri city the NVA renewed their assault.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-91  Reinforced by the 325th Division, they pushed to within a few miles of the city.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-92  The defenders the South Vietnamese 3rd Division  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-93  which had withstood heavy bombardment for over a month  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-94  panicked and fled down highway 1 along with thousands of civilians.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-95  Meanwhile, the North Vietnamese Army took possession...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-96  of Dong Ha on April 29th and Quang Tri on May 1st.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-97  Abandoned by their officers, the flight of the South Vietnamese Army's 3rd Division...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-98  along with the soldier's families and the inhabitants of Quang Tri, was a rout.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-99  In the confusion, bridges were blown too soon, stranding men and equipment.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-100  The road had been mined, and the North Vietnamese added to the chaos...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-101  ...by shelling the retreating columns with tank and artillery fire.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-102  As many as 20,000 may have been killed or wounded  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-103  ...many of them civilian refugees.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-104  The fear now was that the NVA would follow up their victory...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-105  ...by storming down route 1 to the city of Hue.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-106  There, the South Vietnamese Army 1st Infantry division...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-107  ...and two brigades of Marines were dug in round the city.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-108  In fact, massive American firepower  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-109  including the heavy guns of warships offshore...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-110  ...made certain the Northern Divisions could advance no further.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-111  FREEDOM TRAIN  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-112  American air support for the South Vietnamese Army, codenamed operation Freedom Train  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-113  ...had unleashed tens of thousands of air strikes...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-114  ...against the attacking Northern troops and their supply lines.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-115  Two days after the invasion  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-116  the Americans had also started to bomb North Vietnam  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-117  ...the first big raids in 3 1/2 years.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-118  American bombers, including B-52s were attacking military facilities  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-119  supply depots, rail yards and fuel storage.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-120  North Vietnamese leaders had expected the raids but they were sure...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-121  that pressure from their allies the Soviet Union and China...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-122  ...would stop the Americans from launching an all out air offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-123  The North had miscalculated badly.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-124  Both superpowers were far more interested in good relations with the Americans...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-125  ...than with the fate of Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-126  The American air strikes on both South and North Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-127  ...were launched by Air Force planes from Thailand  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-128  Navy aircraft from carriers in the gulf of Tonkin  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-129  ...and B-52s from Thailand and the Pacific.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-130  By June, 77 aircraft were brought down by NVA gunfire.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-131  The attacks swept Northward and within two weeks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-132  ...were hitting targets around Hanoi and Haiphong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-133  In a second phase codenamed Operation Linebacker  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-134  ...power stations and airfields were hit.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-135  The strategic port of Haiphong and six other harbors were mined...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-136  ...and closed all sea traffic.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-137  Soon after, the rail and road transport links to China...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-138  ...were the targets for heavy raids.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-139  “United States forces have been directed to take appropriate measures... “  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-140  With Operation Linebacker the American president, Richard Nixon  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-141  ...meant to force North Vietnam's leaders to call off their offensive against the South...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-142  ...and negotiate a peace.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-143  It was a ferocious campaign.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-144  The intensity of the bombing shocked North Vietnamese leaders.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-145  Worst of all, their allies did no more than protest.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-146  Even when Soviet ships in Haiphong were damaged...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-147  ...there was no dramatic reaction from the Russians.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-148  On May 20th 1972, to the dismay of the North Vietnamese...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-149  Nixon's planned visit to the Soviet Union went ahead as scheduled.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-150  THE DIPLOMATIC FRONT  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-151  On July 19th the South Vietnamese Army with U.S. air support...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-152  ...began a drive to recapture Binh Dinh province and its cities.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-153  The battles would last until September 15th...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-154  ...by which time Quang Tri was reduced to rubble.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-155  The NVA, however, still held the Northern part of the province.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-156  In five months of battles the attackers reckoned they had killed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-157  100,000 NVA and NLF troops and had captured vast quantities of weaponry.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-158  The offensive was over.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-159  In the United States, the renewed American bombing of North Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-160  ...had triggered widespread anti war protests.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-161  Yet for President Nixon the gamble had been a huge success.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-162  A presidential election was around the corner and his popularity had risen sharply.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-163  Now Nixon wanted an agreement with North Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-164  ...that would free American prisoners of war...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-165  ...and allow the remaining 32,000 U.S. troops in the South to leave.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-166  On and off since 1969, Nixon's national security advisor, Henry Kissinger  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-167  had been flying to Paris for secret behind the scenes meetings...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-168  ...with the North Vietnamese while the main talks went on.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-169  Up to now, the talks had been in stalemate  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-170  ...but suddenly the Northern envoy Le Duc Tho, offered a deal.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-171  Three weeks of intense negotiations produced an outline agreement.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-172  Meanwhile, the Americans restricted the bombing of North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-173  The negotiations in Paris had been carried on...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-174  ...without consulting South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-175  Thieu was outraged at the treaty's terms  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-176  ...especially an agreement that North Vietnamese forces in South Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-177  ...would be allowed to stay in position.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-178  Thieu demanded drastic changes and soon the peace talks were again in deadlock.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-179  On December 13th 1972 the Paris peace talks broke down completely.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-180  Nixon was furious.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-181  He had won a landslide victory in the presidential elections...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-182  ...and with his popularity at its height he was determined...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-183  ...to force a solution.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-184  He ordered his military chiefs to prepare a massive bombing campaign...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-185  ...against North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-186  Publicly, he gave Northern leaders 72 hours...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-187  ...to agree to return to the negotiating table.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-188  LINEBACKER II  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-189  On December 18th 1972 President Nixon ordered...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-190  ...the new bombing campaign to begin.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-191  Soon known as Linebacker II it would last for 12 days...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-192  ...and would include a three day all out effort by up to 120 B-52 bombers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-193  Strategic, surgical strikes were planned on fighter airfields, transport targets...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-194  ...and supply depots in and around Hanoi and Haiphong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-195  This time the majority of the attacks were carried out with deadly precision.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-196  They were mounted by Navy A-6 Intruders and Air Force F-111s.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-197  The B-52 stroke by night.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-198  North Vietnamese anti aircraft defenses reacted furiously.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-199  As the defenses learned the paths taken by the B-52s...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-200  ...to and from their targets, SAM anti-aircraft missiles took a heavy toll.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-201  15 B-52s were shot down.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-202  After the Americans changed to less predictable flight paths...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-203  ...losses fell dramatically.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-204  By the 11th day, when North Vietnam agreed to talk peace  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-205  ...its air defense system had been racked.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-206  The bombers had utterly destroyed the North's industries, power plants...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-207  ...and transport system, and mistakenly hit the city's Bach Mai hospital.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-208  In Linebacker II, U.S. aircraft had dropped more than 20,000 tons of bombs.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-209  26 airplanes had been lost and 93 airmen had been killed  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-210  ...captured or were missing.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-211  Hanoi admitted to between 1,300 and 1,600 North Vietnamese dead.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-212  On January 8th 1973 Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-213  ...restarted their talks in Paris.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-214  In six days they hammered out an agreement.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-215  This time the Americans had told the South Vietnamese...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-216  ...that they would get no more U.S financial aid if they opposed the deal.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-217  On the 27th of January 1973 all the warring parties signed the cease fire.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-218  Within a month of the peace treaty the first of 600 American prisoners of war...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-219  ...were released by North Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-220  By March 1973, the last American combat soldiers had left the South...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-221  ...though military advisors and Marines protecting U.S. installations remained.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-222  For the United States officially, the war was over.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-223  The war in Vietnam had been the longest conflict in American history...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-224  ...costing more than 150 billion dollars.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-225  The U.S. armed forces had been left exhausted...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-226  ...barely able to meet their commitments across the globe.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-227  Of the more than three million Americans who had served  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-228  ...almost 58,000 were dead and over 1000 missing in action.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-229  For every soldier killed, six had been wounded, 150,000 seriously.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-230  BUILD-UP  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-231  Although the Americans had left Vietnam and a peace treaty had been signed  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-232  ...few Vietnamese believed that the war was over for them.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-233  The agreement had left 200,000 Northern troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-234  ...occupying strong positions inside the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-235  At the last minute, the Americans had given South Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-236  ...vast quantities of new weapons and was still giving...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-237  ...large amounts of financial aid.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-238  In the wake of the peace agreements South Vietnam's president Thieu...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-239  ...had been given clear assurances by Nixon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-240  If the North broke the treaty, the United States would retaliate with force.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-241  But by the summer of 1973 in the wake of the revelations...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-242  ...about the secret bombing of Cambodia and other political considerations  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-243  Nixon no longer had the power to fulfill his promise.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-244  The U.S. Senate passed a bill banning combat operations...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-245  ...over Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-246  In Hanoi the North's leaders decided that the first priority now...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-247  ...was to rebuild their battered forces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-248  They would avoid big battles and instead try to regain important ground...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-249  ...with small attacks in areas where the enemy was weakest.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-250  At the same time, they would prepare for a future offensive on a gigantic scale.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-251  North Vietnamese commanders were determined that this campaign...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-252  ...should not suffer the supply holdups that plagued the 1972 invasion.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-253  In Laos, the Ho Chi Minh trail was modernized while engineers...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-254  ...began building a proper two lane inroad just inside South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-255  It would be able to take heavy trucks and tanks from the North...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-256  ...to within 70 miles of Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-257  Engineers also began laying 3,000 miles of fuel pipeline  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-258  ...planned to run from the Demilitarized Zone to the Mekong Delta.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-259  CRISIS  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-260  By the start of 1974 the North Vietnamese had rebuilt...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-261  ...their divisions in the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-262  As yet they were too weak to launch a full scale offensive...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-263  ...but they had won some territory in key areas.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-264  On the South Vietnamese side, government forces seemed to be holding up well...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-265  ...but in the country a crisis was looming.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-266  The withdrawal of American troops had already caused...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-267  ...severe economic problems in South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-268  The economy had relied on U.S. aid...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-269  ...but had been inflated out of all proportion by the American presence.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-270  Millions were unemployed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-271  Then came a world oil crisis that quadrupled the price of fuel.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-272  The cost of living soared and political unrest shook Southern cities.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-273  At the same time, corruption in the government and the army reached new heights  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-274  ...as Thieu cut the defense budget drastically.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-275  The effect on the armed forces was disastrous.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-276  Soldiers could no longer support their families as prices rose...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-277  ...and corrupt officers embezzled funds.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-278  Fuel shortages cut helicopter operations by 70%.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-279  A shortage of spare parts immobilized aircraft and vehicles.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-280  Ammunition was rationed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-281  Steady cuts in American financial aid would add...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-282  ...to the overriding sense of decay.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-283  The American tap was being slowly turned off.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-284  At the same time as the Army's morale began to crumble  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-285  ...political support for president Thieu started to evaporate.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-286  Religious groups ethnic, minorities, the press...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-287  ...and even some senior military officers came out against him.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-288  Then on August 9th 1974 Thieu also lost his most powerful backer.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-289  The Watergate scandal forced Richard Nixon to resign...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-290  ...as the President of the United States.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-291  STRATEGIC RAIDS  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-292  The North Vietnamese Army used the spring and summer of 1974...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-293  ...to improve its position in South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-294  NVA commanders launched a series of strategic raids...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-295  ...to regain the initiative and seize key pieces of territory.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-296  In five months of fighting the North Vietnamese succeeded...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-297  ...in gaining most of the ground they wanted.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-298  Their troops also gained valuable combat experience.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-299  Meanwhile Northern leaders argued about the timetable for the main offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-300  At the 21st plenum held in Hanoi in October 1973 they decided...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-301  ...to give priority to a military rather than a political offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-302  While Giap remained chairman of the military committee  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-303  the day to day running of the army went to Van Thien Dung.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-304  It was Dung who would plan and lead the final assault.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-305  They hoped that this offensive would bring...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-306  ...after 10 years of struggle the final victory.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-307  By December 1974, the North Vietnamese Army's main supply route...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-308  ...from the Demilitarized Zone to Loc Ninh was complete.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-309  The strategic raids had pushed the South Vietnamese Army towards the coast.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-310  Northern artillery now threatened several major cities.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-311  In the Saigon area Northern forces had gained ground...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-312  ...on three sides of the capital.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-313  The New North Vietnamese plan was to try and seize Dong Xoai  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-314  ...a vital road junction controlling access to Saigon from the East.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-315  On December 26th 1974 the 7th NVA division captured Dong Xoai.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-316  Next came diversionary attacks to pin down South Vietnamese forces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-317  Phuoc Long, an important provincian city was now threatened...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-318  by two NVA divisions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-319  ...and two infantry regiments...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-320  ...backed by tanks and artillery.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-321  The North Vietnamese forces encircling Phuoc Long city...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-322  ...were more than 15,000 strong.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-323  Even after reinforcements had been flown into the city  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-324  ...the South Vietnamese defenders could muster only 5,500 men.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-325  The Southern Air Force was short of serviceable planes...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-326  ...and faced by heavy anti aircraft defenses, it achieved almost nothing.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-327  By January 6th 1975 the North Vietnamese had overrun Phuoc Long city...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-328  ...and the surrounding province.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-329  The loss of Phuoc Long was a disaster for the South Vietnamese.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-330  Confidence in President Thieu fell to a new low.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-331  The skill and strength of the North Vietnamese divisions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-332  ...had been a shocking revelation.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-333  Worst of all, the most blatant breach of the Paris treaty yet seen in Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-334  ...had produced no reaction from the United States.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-335  OFFENSIVE  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-336  To North Vietnamese leaders the latest battles were proof...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-337  ...that the Americans would not use their air power to defend South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-338  There was also good news from the Soviet Union:  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-339  The promise of huge quantities of extra weapons and supplies.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-340  The Soviets were keen to increase their influence in the region...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-341  ...and believed they were backing a winner.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-342  Even though North Vietnam now had the support it needed...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-343  ...its leaders still meant to move cautiously.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-344  The General Tran Van Tra, the commander in charge of Southern forces...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-345  ...pushed for decisive action.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-346  Once more, he won agreement for a sizable attack...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-347  ...but not for a full scale campaign.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-348  South Vietnamese generals had long ago been given clear orders...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-349  ...about how they were to react to any Northern offensive.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-350  They were to hold on to every scrap of Southern territory...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-351  ...and its forces had been deployed for a defense on all fronts.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-352  On March 1st 1975 the attack planned by General Tran Van Tra...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-353  ...was unleashed in the central highlands.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-354  As ordered, government forces meant to stand and fight...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-355  but suddenly, President Thieu, the Southern leader, changed the plan completely.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-356  The new South Vietnamese strategy was to hold all of the country...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-357  ...below the town of Tuy Hoa.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-358  Areas previously held by the North Vietnamese would be retaken.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-359  Above Tuy Hoa, a series of defense lines would be created...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-360  North and West of Hue, Da Nang...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-361  ...Quang Ngai and Qui Nonh.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-362  If need be, the lines could be abandoned one after the other...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-363  ...in an orderly withdrawal, until a solid defense could be mounted.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-364  This latest North Vietnamese attack had begun with diversionary actions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-365  ...against the strategic cities of Pleiku and Kontum.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-366  But the real target to capture was Ban Me Thout  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-367  ...and the attack began on March 10th.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-368  The Southern 23rd division mounted a counterattack, but failed hopelessly...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-369  ...when South Vietnamese planes scored a direct hit...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-370  ...on their own divisional operations center, ending any organized defense.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-371  A new plan was then put into effect.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-372  South Vietnamese Army units in Kontum and Pleiku provinces were ordered...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-373  ...to withdraw to the coast and hold Tuy Hoa along route 7B.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-374  President Thieu's order to the South Vietnamese Army...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-375  ...to abandon the Central Highlands did not include...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-376  ...the regional military forces and the militia.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-377  As news leaked out, they and the civilian population panicked.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-378  What was supposed to be an orderly withdrawal...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-379  ...soon descended into complete chaos.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-380  Military units, their families and 400,000 fleeing civilians...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-381  ...jammed the primitive road.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-382  The 120 mile retreat down route 7B was a nightmare.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-383  North Vietnamese artillery shelled the column and NVA infantry blocked the road.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-384  Food and water ran out.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-385  A South Vietnamese Ranger battalion of 700 men...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-386  ...successfully cleared the NVA road blocks but was itself eventually wiped out.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-387  By the time the column reached the coast a third of the 60,000 troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-388  ...that had set out were dead or missing.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-389  Of 400,000 civilians a quarter had disappeared.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-390  Meanwhile the North Vietnamese Army launched a second major attack.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-391  100,000 men converged on the major cities of Quang Tri, Hue and Da Nang.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-392  They were spearheaded by powerful armored forces...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-393  And when news of the debacle in the Central Highlands...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-394  ...reached these cities, panic set in.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-395  Worse still, the South Vietnamese elite airborne division based North of Hue...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-396  ...was ordered to return to Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-397  The North Vietnamese plan was to attack from three directions.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-398  They meant to drag Southern forces back to Da Nang.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-399  There the enemy would be trapped and destroyed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-400  Quang Tri province was quickly captured  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-401  ...followed by the town of Tam Ky to the South.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-402  Refugees searched the long route 1 towards Da Nang  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-403  ...at the same time the NVA advance threatened to cut route 1.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-404  South Vietnamese Army units were now ordered to abandon Hue and Chu Lai...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-405  ...and retreat to Da Nang.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-406  On March 25th 1975, Hue South Vietnam's third largest city  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-407  ...fell to the North Vietnamese Army.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-408  The mass of refugees were by now converging on Da Nang.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-409  Over two million had already crammed into the city...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-410  ...including tens of thousands of armed deserters.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-411  North Vietnamese rocket and artillery fire was slamming...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-412  ...into the built up areas and the docks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-413  Fleets of ships and small boats crammed the harbor...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-414  ...and there was a frantic scramble for places.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-415  Thousands drowned or were crushed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-416  Many were shot by troops or armed civilians in the desperate competition to escape.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-417  As 30,000 North Vietnamese troops advanced South to Da Nang  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-418  the South Vietnamese command ordered all its troops to be evacuated by sea.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-419  In the chaos few succeeded in escaping.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-420  The scenes of panic and mayhem at the docks were repeated at Da Nang's airport.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-421  Over the next few days the NVA just rolled into town after town without a fight.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-422  Towns abandoned by the South Vietnamese forces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-423  On March 30th 1975, the North Vietnamese Army took Da Nang.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-424  It was just over 10 years since the first U.S. Marines...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-425  ...had stormed the shore there.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-426  For the South it was a shattering blow, yet its leaders did little  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-427  clinging to the hope that American air power would finally intervene to save the day.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-428  SAIGON  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-429  By early 1975 five weeks into its campaign  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-430  ...the North Vietnamese Army had made stunning gains.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-431  12 provinces and more than 8 million people were under their control.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-432  The South Vietnamese Army had lost its best units  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-433  ...over a third of its men and almost half its weapons.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-434  Northern leaders were astonished by their own success.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-435  The question now was could they press ahead...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-436  ...and take the capital Saigon in a war winning blow?  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-437  Originally they had not planned to get this far until 1976  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-438  but now, it would have to be done within three weeks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-439  ...before the rainy season disrupted operations.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-440  The job of commanding the offensive was that of General Van Thien Dung.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-441  His deputy was General Tran Van Tra the man whose aggressive strategy...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-442  ...had opened the way to Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-443  Le Duc Tho, Henry Kissinger's adversary in the Paris peace talks  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-444  ...now one of the most powerful men in the Northern politburo  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-445  ...would oversee the whole effort accompanied by General Giap.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-446  The final offensive was named the Ho Chi Minh campaign.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-447  For the assault, the NVA deployed a quarter of a million men...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-448  ...and hundreds of tanks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-449  The troops were superbly equipped and supported by a massed artillery.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-450  And as they advanced South they made use...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-451  of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment abandoned by the South Vietnamese.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-452  Behind them was a vast and sophisticated supply system.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-453  North Vietnamese transport aircraft and ships were now ferrying men and materials...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-454  ...into captured airfields and ports in South Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-455  North Vietnamese forces around Saigon were organized into four army corps.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-456  Each was made up into three or four divisions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-457  ...and was given a line of approach to the city.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-458  Facing them were four South Vietnamese divisions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-459  ...along with remnants of an airborne division  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-460  ...an armored brigade  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-461  ...and units of rangers.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-462  As the Northern attack rolled inexorably on they had to cut route 4  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-463  ...isolating Saigon from its forces in the Mekong Delta.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-464  Xuan Loc, a key road junction covering the air bases at Bien Hoa and Tan Son Nhut...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-465  ...would be seized, opening up a route to the capital from the East.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-466  The first attacks of the Ho Chi Minh campaign opened on April 9th 1975.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-467  The only effective resistance to the advance took place at Xuan Loc  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-468  ...where, for almost two weeks Southern forces...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-469  ...made a desperate and die hard stand.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-470  The North Vietnamese threw more than 30,000 men at Xuan Loc...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-471  ...backed by powerful tank and artillery forces.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-472  Against all the odds, the 6,000 men of the South Vietnamese 18th Division  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-473  ...refused to crack.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-474  In two weeks of bitter fighting, the North Vietnamese...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-475  ...hit the defenders of Xuan Loc with 20,000 shells and rockets.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-476  Still, Southern forces drove back mass infantry attacks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-477  They killed over 5,000 NVA troops and destroyed dozens of tanks.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-478  It was to prove the last big battle of the Vietnam war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-479  In the end, the defenders were forced to pull back.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-480  One in three of the South Vietnamese 18th Division were dead.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-481  The fall of Xuan Loc meant the road to Bien Hoa and Saigon itself was wide open.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-482  With a direct threat to the capital, on April 21st  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-483  ...president Thieu resigned and fled to Taiwan.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-484  Members of the Provisional Revolutionary Government in Paris...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-485  ...had earlier indicated they'd be prepared to negotiate...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-486  ...with General Duong Van Minh a trusted intermediary.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-487  However, for the moment, the Southern government was paralyzed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-488  A mass exodus of foreigners, government officials...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-489  ...and the remaining Americans was already underway.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-490  Saigon docks were crammed with boats as thousands tried to escape by sea.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-491  The Northern plan was to encircle and destroy the remaining defenders...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-492  ...outside the capital, that way the NVA might avoid costly street fighting...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-493  ...and the destruction of the city.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-494  On April 25th 1975 they launched their final assault.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-495  One by one the defending South Vietnamese divisions...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-496  ...were cut off and overwhelmed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-497  On April 28th as NVA forces pressed in on the city  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-498  ...General Minh was sworn in as president.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-499  Attacks on Tan Son Nhut airport closed its runways.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-500  Only helicopters now offered a way out.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-501  Starting on April 29th 1975 U.S. Marine and Air Force helicopters...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-502  ...flying from carriers off shore began a massive airlift.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-503  In 18 hours over 1,000 American civilians...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-504  ...and almost 7,000 South Vietnamese refugees were flown out of Saigon.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-505  The helicopters were leaving from Tan Son Nhut Airport...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-506  ...now besieged by refugees desperate to escape.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-507  The scenes of panic and chaos were repeated at the U.S. embassy.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-508  ...where helicopters were landing and taking off from inside the grounds.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-509  U.S. Marines flown in to protect the evacuation  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-510  ...struggled to control the thousands of terrified civilians fighting for a place.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-511  At 4:03am on April 30th two U.S. Marines were caught...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-512  ...on a Vietcong rocket attack on the airport.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-513  They were the last Americans to die in the Vietnam war.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-514  A constant streaming of American helicopters shuttled between...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-515  ...embattled Saigon and the rescue fleet off the coast.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-516  At the same time South Vietnamese military pilots...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-517  ...were using their own or commandeered aircraft to escape.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-518  The decks of some American ships became so crowded...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-519  ...that helicopters had to be pushed overboard.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-520  The last Marines of the U.S. force guarding the evacuation of the embassy...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-521  ...left Saigon at dawn on April 30th 1975.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-522  As their helicopter took off from the Embassy roof  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-523  ...looters were already ransacking the lower stories of the building.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-524  Five hours after the last Americans had gone, North Vietnamese tanks...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-525  ...rolled through the streets of the South Vietnamese capital.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-526  The government had ordered the Army to lay down its weapons...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-527  ...and there was almost no resistance.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-528  Shortly before noon T-54 tanks of the NVA second corps...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-529  ...rolled through the gates of the presidential palace.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-530  AFTER THE BATTLE  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-531  The bitter war which ended on April 30th 1975...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-532  ...had claimed the lives of huge numbers of Vietnamese.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-533  In 15 years, nearly a million NVA and NLF troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-534  ...and a quarter of a million South Vietnamese Army soldiers had died.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-535  Hundreds of thousands of civilians had been killed.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-536  After the victory, Northern officials moved quickly to take control...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-537  ...of every aspect of Southern life.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-538  Even the NLF had little say as Hanoi tightened its grip.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-539  Soon hundreds of thousands of people, officers and men...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-540  ...from the South Vietnamese Army, and those believed tainted by the old regime  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-541  ...would be sent to reeducation camps.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-542  Some years later starting in 1978, half a million more...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-543  ...would risk death fleeing in small boats across the open sea.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-544  Although the war was over peace in Indochina did not last long.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-545  Within 5 days of the fall of Saigon, Khmer Rouge troops...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-546  ...who had taken power in Cambodia carried out the first of many border attacks  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-547  ...killing more than 30,000 Vietnamese.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-548  On December 25th 1978 Vietnam invaded Cambodia...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-549  ...to liberate the population from the genocidal rule of Pol Pot.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-550  China, Pol Pot's ally retaliated by attacking Vietnam.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-551  This conflict would cost another 100,000 lives.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-552  For the United States the Vietnam War left a painful legacy of bitterness and division.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-553  As the nation tried to forget a humiliating and frustrating episode in its history  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-554  ...those who had served were ignored or greeted with outright hostility.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-555  It was 1982 before veterans of the conflict were finally recognized...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-556  ...with the building of the Vietnam Memorial.  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-557  For America, only then could the ghost of Vietnam...  ; xxx 
English-BattleFieldVN12-558  ...finally begin to be laid to rest.  ; xxx

 I was with General Sherman on his march south. 
 What we did Evil Unspeakable things. 
 You were a soldier. 
 You were following orders. 
 No. 
 No, not just orders. 
 We opened a dark door, and the devil stepped in. 
 The only way to cast out the devil is to confess to God. 
 No. 
 No, I can't, Father. 
 Tell me about Meridian. 
 How do you know about Meridian? A nation, which nearly destroyed itself by civil war between north and south, can only be healed by the binding together of east and west. 
 Mark my words, gentlemen, it will be built. 
 The only question which remains is which one of you will join me in this mad, noble quest? Who among you will have to say in years hence that he stood idly by as this nation became an empire? And who among you will be able to say he lent a hand in making manifest our destiny as a great nation? Hear, hear. 
 Bravo. 
 It's all horse crap. 
 The faster I shovel, the faster they eat it up. 
 But it was a truly inspirational speech. 
 Twattle and shite, I say. 
 Then why am I here? You are here to play your part.

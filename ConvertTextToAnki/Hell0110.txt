Mary! I asked you here today to acknowledge the exceptional work you've done.
We could not have come this far without you.
Now tonight at the 40-mile celebration, we shall have the pleasure of entertaining senators, investors and sundry other dignitaries.
And since we are in such short supply of ladies of repute, you will all be invited to the dance.
Ooh.
All right.
But you will have to make yourselves presentable and behave like the proper ladies I know you can pretend to be.
But I warn you, pick pockets, blushingtons, bug hunters will be severely dealt with.
Now, go clean yourselves up.
Boys? How we doing? Getting ready for the dance.
Listen.
Y'all been tailing Swede like I told you? We have.
But to no avail.
He's a slippery bastard, that one.
He rode out of town last night.
You know where he went? No.
But he bought two bottles of whiskey at the Starlight before he left.
Must be going on a bender.
Swede don't drink.
Then I guess he's meeting someone who does.
I wasn't there that night.
Check the date on my discharge.
I was wounded at Starkville two weeks before Meridian.
Then how could you know what happened that night.
I stayed in touch with Johnson and the boys after the war.
They told me all about it.
And you can still testify as to why Bohannon had motive to kill Johnson and this other man.
You think I'm crazy? He already tried to kill me once.
He'll finish the job if I go back there.
This man, he's not going to give up.
And you can keep running, but one day he just gonna show up on your doorstep and kill you dead.
Now, let's finish this thing, huh? Now.
Hey.
- That whiskey goes in the dance tent.
- Yes, sir.
Not in your tent.
I'm going to check 'em later, make sure they ain't light one or two bottles.
LILY: Damn it all! Right.
You having trouble with your floorboards, ma'am? Well, you're very perceptive, aren't you? I'm afraid I'm not much of a carpenter.
No, ma'am, you ain't.
Could you possibly help me? That is, if you're not busy killing anyone.
Well, sure as heck can't do any worse.
Great.
You're quite handy with a hammer and a nail.
Were you really a farmer before the war? Is that so hard to believe? Yes, actually.
I find it hard to imagine you in a domestic setting.
I couldn't either.
I always had one eye on the door.
So you were married.
Was.
Had a son, too.
War come along and jumped at the chance.
Mary didn't want me to go but She didn't stand in my way, either.
Now I'd give anything to be home and just So you lost them both? Your wife and your son.
I'm so sorry.
It's all right.
That about does it here.
Wait.
Please, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.
Please, don't Whatever happened to your wife and son, please don't let it kill the man they loved.
Sorry, Mrs Bell.
It's too late for that.
Mr Durant.
I thought you'd be well on your way by now.
Decided to stay.
Is that wise? I ain't never been accused of being wise, sir.
So we'll see you at the dance tonight? You will if I'm there.
Special ordered from New York.
Oh, Thomas.
I cannot accept this.
Oh, it's not a gift.
Think of it as payment.
For what? I've invited many potential investors to the celebration this evening.
What does that have to do with me? It's become clear to me that this railroad could do with a face, other than my own, associated with it.
You're thinking of the fair-haired maiden of the west.
Yes.
You think she'll lure the investors.
Like moths to a flame, my dear.
I'll consider it.
On one condition.
Why is nothing ever elemental with you? I want to be a part of it.
Part of what? The building of this road.
I want to see it through to the end.
Do we have a deal? Your condition is accepted, madam.
Sorry.
I don't I don't mean to disturb your prayers, preacher.
How can I help you, son? Well, I'm on a dark path, sir.
Been on it for a while now.
Where does the dark path lead? More blood.
More hatred.
I met somebody who reached out to me and asked me to turn away from the darkness.
Been wanting to preach to me, so here's your chance.
Well, there is a God.
Of that I have no doubt.
But there's a There's a devil, too.
And you know what that old devil did? You want me to tell you about that? Yeah.
Yeah? Well, that devil, he cut off God's arms.
And he hacked off God's legs.
And he gouged out his eyes, ripped out his tongue, and left him lying there in a bloody heap on the floor.
But he left God's ears so he could hear us down here when we're wailing and thrashing and praying for his help.
But, brother, there ain't a damn thing God can do to help us.
What are you saying, preacher? Just choose hate.
It's so much easier.
Brother! Choose hate.
I thought everybody was supposed to have the day off.
Everybody but us.
We had no say in it, neither.
Want me to talk to Durant about it? You shittin' in some mighty high cotton ain't you, boy? Watch yourself, Psalms.
I'm still your boss.
Who do you think you is in these fancy clothes, huh? Who cocked your hat, boy? You did.
Ain't supposed to be our boss.
You're supposed to be our leader.
Thinking you looking out for us.
Turn out you just looking out for your own damn self.
Ain't nobody else gonna do it.
I ain't your master.
You need to look you for your own self, huh? Carlton.
Cullen.
Mr Bohannon.
Been looking everywhere for you.
What's going on, Sean? I'm just making plans for The Swede.
He's just rolled back in, and he wasn't alone.
Oh, yeah? Who'she with? Well, I didn't hear any names.
But he had a on a Union jacket with sergeant stripes.
Sergeant's jacket, huh? Yeah, I think so.
Look, I know we've had our difference You sure you saw sergeant stripes? Yes! Where they at? Where they at? Where they at? Swede's caboose.
Will this make us even for the fight? Bohannon.
A couple of federal marshals are coming to arrest me tonight.
For what? Murder.
So why ain't you just up and left? Sergeant's here.
Swede tracked him down.
I reckon he talked him into testifying against me.
How you know Harper will be the man you're looking for? - He has to be.
- You don't know that.
What the hell is your stake in all this? I ain't got none.
Why do you even care? You told me something once.
It was the only thing that ever set me free.
Yeah, what's that? You got to let go of the past.
You will be the king of the ball.
Unfortunately with no queen by my side.
- Oh, you refer to Mrs Lily Bell? - Mmm.
Sir, shall we take a walk? Mr Gundersen, have you ever had your heart ripped out by a woman? I was married once, sir, but she ran off with a gypsy.
My heart was not ripped out, but she did steal my cuckoo clock.
Well, my gypsy is Bohannon.
Loki, yeah.
- What? - So he and Mrs Lily Bell.
I gave him a chance to run, but he wouldn't take it.
Run? But why? Mr Gundersen, I told him about the federal marshals.
He knows you're up to something.
Oh! Why did you tell him? I wanted to get rid of him.
The fool wouldn't leave.
Why are you telling me this now? Because I want you to succeed in your plan, Mr Gundersen.
Mmm.
You need to get out of here.
- Now.
- Why? He's coming.
- Find a place to hide.
- Where? - I don't want to know.
- Why not? So Bohannon can't get it out of me.
Now, listen, no matter what, you must meet that train.
And when it arrive, the marshals will protect you.
Where is he? Where is who? In the myths of my homeland, there is a God who go by the name of Loki.
This Loki is the God of Chaos.
He cause nothing but trouble everywhere he go.
No matter how hard the other gods try to catch him, the slippery little devil always manages to escape.
You have three seconds to tell me where he is.
I honestly do not know.
If I did, I would not tell you.
Go ahead, kill me.
I go to my grave happy knowing that I'm the one who'll bring you down.
Just as I thought.
Killing me does not equate in your moral mathematics.
Eva! Hooee! Darling.
If you ain't slicker than a fine gentleman's snot rag.
You ain't looking too shabby your own self, gal.
Thank you.
Where'd you get that pretty thing? Mrs Bell gave it to me.
What you doing out here? They're building a town.
A real town.
I've been on the move for as long as I can remember.
Since before them injuns took me.
I was thinking it might be nice for us to, you know, settle down.
What you mean? Well, we're getting hitched, so why not settle down like a proper man and wife - And raise a family.
- Getting hitched? Like we talked about.
I ain't never said nothing about getting hitched.
But I I thought the other day you said that you wanted me to be yours.
I do.
Well, I thought that meant I just ain't thought things out that far.
And I sure as hell ain't staying in no podunk railroad town.
Look at me.
When they freed me, I ain't have a penny to my name, Eva.
And now I work for Mr Thomas Durant hisself.
Oh! I see.
For the first time in my life, I got money in my pocket.
My money in my pocket.
Might be looking at some kind of real future.
- Without me? - No.
I want it with you.
What, as your private whore? You're here.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Imagine it.
A journey that now takes six months will be cut to seven days.
Seven days.
It boggles the mind.
You will be able to spend Christmas in New York and And New Year's in San Francisco.
Gentlemen, I give you Mrs Lily Bell.
- Ma'am.
- Mrs Bell.
Is there room on your dance card? Evening, Miss Eva.
Mr Toole.
Are you not waiting for Mr Ferguson? No, I am not.
Ma'am, if I'm not overstepping me bounds, would you do me the honor of dancing with me? I'm sorry, Mr Toole.
I don't much feel like dancing right now.
I understand.
Thank you, ma'am.
Mr Toole.
There was a time out in the frontier with Robert when I wondered if this beautiful landscape might not be better unspoilt.
Part of me still wonders that.
But after seeing all these people working so hard to build this road, after understanding the sheer audacity of this American endeavor, well, I see now there truly is greatness in it.
To Lily Bell, the fair-haired maiden of the west.
- Cheers.
- Hear, hear.
You following me? Oh, no.
No, sir.
Just taking the evening air.
What is this? It's about a payment.
No, not now.
Hey! Hey! Get your bloody rope off me! Son of a bitch! Get your bloody hands off me! Your bloody hands off me! We're here to collect a debt, Mr Swede.
You be careful, Irish boy, what you choose to do now, son of a bitch.
Bloody How do you like that? Bust his head! Bastard! Get your hand off me, bloody Irish.
Bloody! Would you like to dance, sir? I'm sure some of these other fellows are much better dancers than me.
But I don't want these other fellows.
You'll see a lot of perks working for me, Mr Ferguson.
Is that right? Mmm-hmm.
Excuse me a second.
Ah Elam! What the hell are you doing with my woman? - Hey, now, Ferguson.
- Stop it, Elam.
Let him go.
Come on, Elam.
I ain't your woman.
You made that pretty clear.
I didn't make nothing clear.
You're still mine.
What, like your property? I'm staying behind, Elam.
It seems like Mr Toole has got the same idea.
You and him? No, there ain't no me and him.
We're just two people who don't want to be vagabonds no more.
I love you, Elam, but I'm tired of being a tramp.
Excuse me.
Sorry, I'm afraid I need to cut in.
Damn it.
You don't have to do this.
I wasn't there, Mr Bohannon.
You're a liar.
Johnson said the sergeant strangled my wife.
And I saw the picture.
- You was the platoon sergeant.
- Not then, I wasn't.
You raped and murdered my wife.
I wasn't there.
- Just admit it.
- I can prove it.
No.
You have to be him.
I can prove it.
Hey.
I've been looking for you.
I seen the marshals back there.
Hmm.
You killed him? Yeah.
But he wasn't there.
I killed the wrong man.

# Cold is the water # It freezes your already cold mind # Already cold, cold mind # And death is at your doorstep # And it will steal your innocence # But it will not steal your substance # But you are not alone in this # And you are not alone in this # As brothers we will stand # And we'll hold your hand # Hold your hand # And you are the mother # The mother of your baby child # The one to whom you gave life # And you have your choices # And these are what make man great # His ladder to the stars # But you are not alone in this # And you are not alone in this # As brothers we will stand # And we'll hold your hand # Hold your hand # But you are not alone in this # And you are not alone in this # As brothers we will stand # And we'll hold your hand # Hold your hand # But I will tell the night # And whisper,  Lose your sight  # But I can't move the mountains # For you # Yes, I know this area quite well.
As I remember, Robert warned you about laying track here because this area was prone to washouts.
Robert was right.
I was wrong.
Is that what you need to hear? Well, I've said it.
Now, this section needs to be re-surveyed and re-built.
Can you do it? Yes.
But it'll have to be re-routed south as Robert intended.
Do you see this ridge? This is solid bedrock.
Yes, but that'll take longer.
You'll have to have your men work faster, Doc.
You get paid to build 40 miles of useable road.
If you build here again, it will get washed out again.
- Well, it may not rain again for months or - Those are my terms.
Of course, you could always find another surveyor Somewhere.
Excuse me.
GRIGGS: Black Moon, you're gonna answer for this, you know that.
I should have let my brother kill you.
- You should try right now.
Hey! We've had enough killing for one day.
I don't suppose either of you are keen on joining me? To do what? What I came for.
You'll never find them.
We'll see about that.
They know that you're following them.
They'll kill the both of you.
Yeah, we'll see about that, too.
Last chance, Bohannon.
I figured.
What about you? You don't need his permission.
He's nobody's master anymore.
Go if you're going.
Mr Bohannon, you have to finish this.
What are you talking about? This.
What you came to do.
We came to kill the bastards who derailed the train.
We got 'em.
No one's gonna believe you unless you have proof.
You mean scalps? They're just gonna have to take my word for it.
I ain't bringing back proof.
Not even for $20 a head? Seems a shame leaving all this money lying around here for the buzzards, don't you think? My brother belongs to me.
Don't look at me.
I'm a sinner, Ruth.
You know that better than anyone, don't you? - Father? - No.
You let me finish.
I've been wrasslin' with God, Ruth.
And I honestly believe that I was chosen for a great mission.
And that's why I left.
But you failed.
No, I'd like to think that my work with John Brown may have helped in some small way to free the slaves.
I didn't say John Brown failed.
I said you failed.
One drop of love That's all we needed.
One drop of love would have sustained us.
Now, Ruth, I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.
Don't you walk away from me! Praise his name, sister.
Praise his name.
Praise! The McGinnes Brothers Magic Lantern Show.
Back in business! You know what we forgot, Seano? We forgot to get a new sign.
There's no more drama, comedy, history, is there? As usual, Brother, I am three steps ahead of you.
Painter's due in an hour.
- Have the new sign by nightfall.
Nell! Nell! A word! Now that is a fine door-ful of a woman.
Nell, you know we have an agreement.
Nobody's working, Swede.
When nobody works, nobody gets paid.
If nobody gets paid, then nobody comes to see my Son of a bitch.
Now, we have an agreement.
There's a better way, Brother.
Straight and steady, please, sir.
Yes, ma'am.
Mrs Bell, somebody's coming.
Mrs Bell.
Mr Bohannon.
- What you doing out here? - Surveying.
I'm helping Durant complete his 40 miles.
We killed the dog soldiers that murdered your husband.
I thought you should know.
So Robert's death has been avenged.
I'd hoped it would close the hole I feel in my heart.
Ain't nothing gonna close that, ma'am.
- Very impressive, Mr - Ferguson.
Elam Ferguson.
I suppose Mr Bohannon sent you to collect the bounty.
Bohannon ain't take them scalps.
I did.
Well I guess I owe you some money, then.
Uh Ten dollars a scalp, if I remember correctly.
Twenty.
And if you don't mind, I prefer them gold eagles to paper.
Would you like a drink? I ain't too much of a drinking man.
Well, a cigar, perhaps? Thank you.
Well, please sit.
You strike me as a capable man.
I know which end is up.
Well, that is good to know.
Because I am always on the lookout for a man willing to get his hands dirty from time to time.
A man who's willing to do things off the books, as it were.
Mmm.
I'm looking for a man who wants to be feared and respected.
A man trying to improve his station in life.
Oh, you slay me, honey.
You really do.
How's about you stay home tonight? Whatcha mean? I means, why not take a night off? Maybe take more than a night off.
Are you saying I want you to be mine.
None other.
Ferguson, you in there? Elam Ferguson, come on out here.
- You.
You son of a bitch.
- Mercy.
On the immaculate heart of the sweet virgin herself, I pray for mercy.
And I beg you to hear me out.
You shot me straight in me gob, Mr Ferguson.
A shot that would have sent any man to his grave.
But praise the mother's son, at the last second an angel reached out and she flicked the bullet out of me neck.
I tell you true.
It's the reason I kneel before you now.
Let me show you.
Let me show you the hole.
Please, Mr Ferguson.
Bear witness to a miracle.
As I wandered in the wilderness, like our Lord himself, I came face to face with me ignorance and cruelty towards you.
And I swore to God almighty that if I survived, I would come to you on bended knee and beg for your forgiveness.
Not me.
Her.
Come on out here.
Tell her you're sorry.
I'm sorry, lass.
Sorry as the sorriest sinner.
I should not have harmed you such.
All right, then.
Go on and git.
Black Moon.
Come down.
It's your father.
Father, you're safe.
I come looking for Pawnee Killer.
Instead, I find a burial.
Have you nothing to tell me? I came to do it myself.
Go.
Climb up.
Let's complete this ceremony.
Step right this way, lads, and get an eyeful.
See the loveliest creatures from the bluest streets of Paris, français.
- See soiled doves bare all.
- You been gone.
Took the train to Chicago.
Whew, what a town.
Jeez.
Looks like you brought a bit of Chicago back with you.
Indeed.
Do you want to take a peek? On the house, of course.
Anything for Mr Bohannon.
Nah.
Thanks.
Hold on.
Sean would like a word with you.
Looks like you been doing some business, huh? Aye, we're packing 'em in like sardines.
How'd you pay for the extra slides? You win money in a fight or something? Yeah.
'Course, the The Swede will want his pound of flesh.
- He takes a cut? - And then some.
What you want me to do about it, Sean? Here's the thing.
We're not the only ones being preyed upon.
All the merchants of Hell on Wheels are paying him off.
So? So We took up a collection.
Everybody pitched in.
There's $100 in here For you.
What the hell for? For killing The Swede.
I ain't no gun for hire.
All right, I tell you what.
I happen to know The Swede's been stealing from Durant.
Dig you up some dirt on him, and Durant will ride him out of town on a rail.
For free.
Ask me to sit down.
Go on, ask me.
Have a seat.
Now, pour me a drink.
Another glass.
Your health.
Tastes like shit.
You ain't much of a drinking man, is you? Gave it up.
Why is that? Last time I got drunk, I got into something bad.
Listen, I need to ask you something.
You know that bidness we had to attend to? You good with that? I'm better than good.
'Bout time I be the one who gets to do the hurting.
Besides, seem Mr Durant done took a liking to my work.
He say he might just call on me when need be.
Durant? Better watch yourself.
That's a slick slope you're heading down.
Hmm.
Slick with blood.
Somebody else's, for a change.
For somebody who don't drink, you're putting that down pretty good.
Ladies and gentlemen, take your glasses in hand for a toast to the great Indian killers who have made our home a safe place to work and drink! Shut up! Listen up.
I want y'all to get a good night's sleep.
Tomorrow, we hit that 40-mile marker, and I'm gonna work y'all like mongrel dogs.
It's gonna get built, gentlemen.
And we're just the bastards to build it.
Senator.
I'm glad you are here to witness such a momentous feat.
No, you're not.
You're only interested in our quid pro quo.
If you insist.
I had the Pinkertons track down the Illinois man you were looking for.
Whereabouts of Sergeant Frank Harper.
Seems he's holed up at a trading post near Council Bluffs.
Your brother was the runt of the litter.
Smaller than all the other boys.
They picked on him and teased him.
He was always in a fight, but he never backed down.
It made him strong.
It made him a great warrior.
But not a great man.
He never learned, as you did, that sometimes it's better not to fight, and other times, you must fight the ones you love.
When I saw what you were wearing, when I saw what you had prepared for your brother, I hoped that you would return to me.
But now, I see in your eyes you are becoming your own man.
And so today, I mourn for one son, Pawnee Killer.
And I mourn the loss of my other son, Black Moon, which hurts me so much more.
That's it, boys, almost there! This is it right here! This is your marker! We're gonna make it.
Now put your backs into it.
Pick it up, boys! I want them next two rails laid in the next five minutes.
Pick up the pace.
We run out of flanges again, I'll skin the runner alive! MICKEY: Hold the spike, would you.
Hold the spike.
Well, jeez! Three, two, one.
That's it, boys, almost there.
Break time's over.
Back to work.
Don't bloody look at it, sink! Nail crew, just get 'em nailed in! Clean-up crew, finish it.
That's it.
Back into it.
Almost there! You embarrass me now, boys, and I'll skin the lot of ya.
Let's go! Hold! Down.
Last one, boys! Last one.
Mr Bohannon! May I? Hmm.
Congratulations.
Congratulations, lieutenant governor.
Congratulations.
Ruth? I'm sorry.
You were waiting for me? Every night.
Joseph, are you hurt? No.
I killed him, Ruth.
I killed my own brother.
Thanks.
Excuse me, sir? Yeah? Oh.
Pardon me, ma'am.
What will you be having? Well, champagne, perhaps? What? Um How about a glass of sherry? - I love a good sherry.
Ah! Brandy.
LILY: Fine.
Brandy would be fine.
It's on me.
May I? By all means.
Thank you.
Not good? I've had better.
Yeah.
Well, you did it, 40 miles.
You said you would, and you did.
First time in my life.
Failed as a tobacco farmer, lost a war, now I'm a railroad man.
Maybe third time's the charm, huh? Maybe.
That first night we met, you told me I had no idea who you was or what you was capable of, and you was right.
I thought you were some spoiled limey brat.
Yeah, I guess I got you wrong, huh? Well, what do you think of me now, Mr Bohannon? Mrs Bell! Mr Bohannon! Doing a little celebrating? Well, you both deserve it.
What you did today was historic.
Thank you, Thomas.
Will you join us? I would love to, but there are a few issues outstanding that I need to discuss with my foreman.
Excuse me.
Black Moon.
You in here? Black Moon? You made me a pledge.
You told me you would win this war called the Union Pacific.
Today, you won a major battle.
You're a man of your word.
Thank you, sir.
I wanted to both congratulate you and offer you a bonus.
Oh! I don't need any more money, sir.
It's not that kind of bonus, Mr Bohannon.
It's much more valuable than money.
Information.
You You're Lieutenant Griggs, from the cavalry.
- I heard about you.
- Yeah? Well, I heard Black Moon was living in here.
You feel that Joseph led you astray? He needs to be made accountable.
You know, The Swede has been, shall we say, focused on you for some time.
- Like a hound got the scent.
- Mmm.
He just sent a wire to the federal marshals in Washington, D.
C.
Claims he has evidence linking you to several murders back east.
You a family man, Lieutenant? Do you have a wife and children? I mean, what if someone killed your son and scalped your daughter and raped your wife? Would you stand idly by? They'll be coming to arrest you.
You telling me all this 'cause you want me to run, Mr Durant? I'm giving you a chance to save yourself, Bohannon.
I don't know, could you Could you find it in your heart to forgive him? Is he here? Not now.
Sure, I'll forgive him.
Right after I kill him.
We're We're all held accountable, you know, one way or another.

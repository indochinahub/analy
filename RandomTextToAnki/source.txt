Unburden yourself, my son.
I was with General Sherman on his march south.
What we did Evil Unspeakable things.
You were a soldier.
You were following orders.
No.
No, not just orders.
We opened a dark door, and the devil stepped in.
The only way to cast out the devil is to confess to God.
No.
No, I can't, Father.
Tell me about Meridian.
How do you know about Meridian? A nation, which nearly destroyed itself by civil war between north and south, can only be healed by the binding together of east and west.
Mark my words, gentlemen, it will be built.
The only question which remains is which one of you will join me in this mad, noble quest? Who among you will have to say in years hence that he stood idly by as this nation became an empire? And who among you will be able to say he lent a hand in making manifest our destiny as a great nation? Hear, hear.
Bravo.
It's all horse crap.
The faster I shovel, the faster they eat it up.
But it was a truly inspirational speech.
Twattle and shite, I say.
Then why am I here? You are here to play your part.
Crédit Mobilier.
Crédit Mobilier will be awarded all major construction contracts on the Union Pacific Railroad.
I own it.
I'm giving you the chance to get in on the ground floor.
So, you'll be paying yourself to build a railroad with Government subsidies.
Now that, my friend, is inspirational.
Yes, it is, but I can't afford these on a senator's salary.
As head of the Congressional Oversight Committee on Railroads, I'm sure you will find a way to pay for them over and over and over again.
Might I ask how many shares are here? Two hundred.
I think you'll find that's fair.
Four hundred sounds fairer.
Are you trying to renegotiate a bribe? No.
Bribe  is such a dirty word.
Hmm? Why don't you think on it, Doc, hmm? We've got a vote before the committee next Tuesday.
Good luck with your land speculation in Nebraska.
Fifty thousand acres, bought on the cheap, hmm? What would happen to the value of that land if I decided to route the railroad around it? Take the stocks, Jordan.
But I've decided to renegotiate.
One hundred shares.
MICKEY:  He was gun Gunned down  While he   Prayed.
I was getting it.
Prayed  In the   Conference.
Prayed in the conference?  Confessional.
Someone killed the poor bugger whilst he was confessing? What is the world coming to? Well, I suppose the only consolation is that he got to heaven that much faster.
How did you come by that conclusion? Well, he confessed his sins.
He died in grace.
So God just up and punches his ticket to heaven, huh? Well, yeah.
If that's how God goes about his business, you can keep him.
Keep God? Do you not believe in a higher power? Yes, sir, I wear it on my hip.
Are you a gunslinger then? No.
I was just heading out west, looking for work on the railroad.
Yeah, so are we.
To seek our fortune, as it were.
I'm Mickey and this here's Sean.
Cullen Bohannon.
:: Mickey has twelve toes.
:: And Sean but eight.
Individually, we're freaks.
But together, we're whole.
# There's a bullet in my pocket burning a hole # It's so far from your weapon, the place you were born # There's a bullet in my pocket burning a hole # You're so far from your weapon and you wanna go home # I tried to give you whiskey but it never did work # Suddenly you're begging me to do so much work # Right away from the get go, the bullet was cursed # Ever since I had you, every little thing hurts # You wanna get up, let go, I said no # You wanna get up, let go # Next.
Name? Cullen Bohannon.
Railroad experience? None.
Why should I hire you? I'm willing to do just about anything.
Uh-huh.
You and a thousand others.
I ain't got no place else to go, sir.
Save it.
Will you work the cut crew? - Yeah.
- Yeah? What's the cut crew? Oh, it's brutal work.
It is not for the faint of heart.
It gets hotter than a whore house on nickel night out there.
I ain't afraid of hard work.
You're a Johnny Reb, aren't you? Yes, sir.
I could tell by that Griswold you're carrying.
It was a Griswold like that that took off my hand.
Well, we all paid a price, Mr Bohannon, and I imagine you bear your own scars.
I was a Copperhead before the war.
So, I bear no hard feelings towards you graybacks.
You did what you had to do.
It's the darkies I blame.
The way I see it, they owe me far more than just a hand.
Say, did you own slaves, Mr Bohannon? I did.
Well, then I imagine you know your way around a nigger.
This is Mr Bohannon, your walking boss.
You can address him as Boss or Boss Man or Walking Boss.
Mr Bohannon is a former master of slaves.
Some things don't never change.
So he's up to your tricks.
He's going to work the blue out of your gums, boys.
Any coffee boilers or otherwise slack work ethic will be dealt with severely.
Now, dig me a cut.
# Pass me not, O gentle savior Jesus Christ, accept this humble servant into your heart.
# Hear my humble cry # While on others Thou art calling Be reborn in the glory of Jesus.
# Do not pass me by # Savior Brother Joseph Your sins are washed away.
# Hear my humble cry # # Oh, what a beautiful city # Oh, what a beautiful city # Oh, what a beautiful city # Twelve gates to the city Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, whoa.
Easy, easy, boy.
# There's three gates in the east # There's three gates in the west # Right here.
Unload the tent.
Raise the church.
In this den of thieves, I shall build a house of the Lord.
You putting up a church here? What better place to convert the wicked, sister? You better keep an eye on your flock, Reverend.
We do our own share of convertin' around here.
Why have you made my roads so straight? Are we not in a race with the Central Pacific? The Central Pacific? Those imbeciles will never make it out of Sacramento.
They're so desperate, I hear they're hiring chinks.
What I was thinking was something more like this.
But we're building over flat land, why wouldn't we make it straight?  Why wouldn't we make it straight?  he asks.
Take a closer look.
Let me elucidate.
In case you haven't heard, this undertaking is being subsidized by the enormous teat of the Federal Government.
This never-ending, money-gushing nipple pays me $16,000, per mile, yet you build my road straight! You're fired.
Get out.
I said, get out.
You look like a bright, young man.
This land It's bewitching.
It hasn't changed since Lewis and Clark first saw it 60 years ago.
Do you ever wonder if our work here will be the ruin of all of this? Progress comes with a cost, Lily.
I just think it's so much more beautiful without people.
Don't fool yourself.
There are plenty of people here.
We're entering Cheyenne territory.
You do remember our agreement? You mean our agreement regarding my not leaving your side while you're ill? No.
I mean, our agreement that you should go back to Chicago once we entered hostile Indian territory.
Yes, my dear, but it was before you took ill.
Yeah.
I believe our second agreement supersedes our first.
Oh, dear God, now you sound like a lawyer.
If you want me to go to Chicago, lead the way.
I'm not leaving without you, Robert.
Don't tempt me, Lily.
I might just do it.
You play me for dumb.
You've worked at this for too long to go back now.
We've worked at this.
This This would mean nothing to me if you weren't here to share it.
Robert Bell, are you hiding something in your trousers? It must be all this fresh air.
Breathe deeply.
So, uh So how many slaves did you own? Five in all.
I had me a small tobacco farm.
Any women? Two.
You ever sample the goods? Uh-uh.
It wasn't like that.
Call.
You bitter that you had to give up your slaves? I gave them their freedom a year before the war started.
Are you serious? I kept them on at wages.
You are an odd duck, Bohannon.
I married a northerner.
She convinced me of the evils of slavery.
So, you You released your slaves, yet you still fought in the war.
Why? Honor.
The southerner and his honor.
Where is your wife now? She's dead.
Did the war take her? Something like that.
Think they heard us? Who cares? I don't want to torment the poor bastards out here alone in the middle of nowhere.
They have their hands.
Ohh.
I feel this cough is going to be the death of me.
Nonsense.
:: Nonsense.
- Lily If I were to die Robert Please Please don't talk like that.
Don't talk like that.
The maps.
We have to save the work.
Run for the trees.
Don't look back.
Shh.
No, please, no.
Robert! Rise and shine, Bohannon.
It's another beautiful day on the railroad.
Get up! Get up! Come on! My horse.
My horse.
My kingdom for a horse.
Hoe that line.
Half-hour to lunch! Half-hour! Peckerwood.
He ain't so bad.
Shut your dumb black ass up.
- I don't need no slave boss motivatin' me.
:: Mmm-hmm.
Come on! Help me out here.
# All them pretty gals gonna be there # Shuck that corn before you eat Come on! Come on! I say # All them pretty gals gonna be there # Shuck that corn before you eat # They gonna fix it for us rare # Shuck that corn before you eat # I know that supper gonna be big # Shuck that corn before you eat # I think I smell a fire roast pig # Shuck that corn before you eat Keep it going.
# I hope they got some whiskey there # You might want to take a look at this, sir.
:: Put it in the pile.
:: No, sir.
You really need to look at this.
Dear God.
Robert Bell is dead.
:: Is this the entire message? - Yes, sir.
Nothing about - Maps being found? - No, sir.
One last telegram.
To the Union Pacific Board of Directors,  change of plans.
Stop.
Heading for Hell on Wheels immediately.
Stop.
Send it.
You need some water.
No, it ain't break time yet.
Come on, you need some water.
Come on.
Come on.
I thought I told you to dump that dirt on the other side.
:: Hey.
:: Shut your mouth.
I told him to do it.
We fixing to fill in that dip over yonder next.
I figured we might just as well have some fill dirt nearby.
You talk to me before any decisions are made, all right? Yes, sir, master.
What did you say? Bohannon, what the hell is going on here? You drink when I tell you to drink! Get up! Willy! Willy! Willy! Willy! This is what happens when you break my rules.
Now, what you planning on doing with that Arkansas Toothpick, huh? Don't do it.
We ain't on no plantation no more, walking boss.
Ain't nothing good gonna come from this.
Yeah, well, ain't nothing good coming from this either.
That dumb nigger actually thought this was gonna change things.
Look where that got him.
Might just as well wipe my ass with it.
You kill him, you will hang.
How they gonna hang me if there ain't no witnesses? You come at me with a knife, son, you better be ready to use it.
Yeah.
You got to let go of the past.
Have you let it go? You're doing quite a trade here.
Not bad for a couple of Irish bumpkins.
Where's Mickey? He's preparing for the grand finale.
# When you're far away # Far from the land you'll be Do you not pine for your own homeland, Mr Bohannon? No.
And why is that? It's gone.
# Bright and fair # And rich in its treasures # Muldoon # # Won't you come back soon # Love you # So, tell me, Bohannon, did you see the elephant during the war? Yes, I saw my share of action, yeah.
Where? Yeah.
I don't like to talk about it.
I loved the war.
I loved the war! The best thing that ever happened to me.
I thought you said you were against it? Oh, yeah, I was.
But that doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy myself once pressed into service.
Hey! Oh, hey, I'm skint.
No, this one's on me.
Well, thank you.
Most men shrink when they see the elephant up close.
Oh, yeah? - But I blossomed.
:: Mmm-hmm.
Thank you.
Though I I must admit that there were certain lines that I crossed, lines of morality that I didn't think myself capable of crossing.
But that's what men do in war.
Moral men don't.
So, you did nothing that you were ashamed of? I did plenty I was ashamed of.
You ever been to Meridian, Mississippi, Mr Johnson? That is my Remington pointed at your gut.
So, let's take a walk out back.
I know about the two men you killed in Maryland.
I read in the paper about Prescott getting killed in that church by a Griswold.
But I'll be damned if you didn't show up a few days later with a Griswold strapped to your hip, as plain as day.
And then you ask me about Meridian? That cinched it.
I am not proud of what happened to your wife, Bohannon.
It didn't happen to her.
You did it to her.
Yes.
Yes, we did it to her.
I did it to her.
Your wife was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I want you to know, it wasn't my idea to kill her.
She hung herself.
No, she didn't.
The sergeant strangled her and strung her up.
Sergeant? What sergeant? Oh, he's out here, too.
I figured you were saving him for last.
Oh, you didn't know about him? You tell me who he is.
Well, it hardly matters now.
No! Tell me his name.
Tell me his name.
Is it a villain you want? I'll play the part.
After all, what is a drama without a villain? What is the building of this grand road if not a drama? This business is not for the weak of heart.
It is a thorny, brutal affair that rewards the lion for his ferocity.
What of the zebra? What of the poor zebra? Well, the zebra is eaten as the zebra should be.
Make no mistake.
Blood will be spilled.
Lives will be lost.
Fortunes will be made.
Men will be ruined.
There will be betrayal and scandal.
And perfidy of epic proportions.
But the lion shall prevail.
You see, the secret I know is this.
All of history is driven by the lion.
We drag the poor zebra, kicking and braying, staining the earth with his cheap blood.
History doesn't remember us fondly, but then history is written by the zebra for the zebra.
One hundred years hence, when this railroad spans the continent and America rises to be the greatest power the world has seen, I will be remembered as a caitiff, malefactor, who only operated out of greed for personal gain.
All true.
All true.
But remember this, without me, and men like me, your glorious railroad would never have been built.
It's Durant.
What the hell is he doing here? - Are you the Chicago Tribune reporter? - Yes.
Did you photograph this body? Yes, sir, Mr Durant.
But just the one body.
What is wrong with you, man? - I'm sorry.
I thought - Just the one won't do.
Get those bodies back off the wagons.
Come on, snap to, boys.
I want this scene photographed exactly as you found it.
I want an unblinking look at the horror perpetrated here.
More arrows.
We need more arrows.
He can't feel anything.
He's dead, for God's sake.
The maps.
:: Did you find them? - No, sir.
Nothing anywhere.
Keep looking.
Mr Durant, over here.
Robert.
Pack up everything.
Bring it all back to Hell on Wheels.
They found Johnson's body.
Everybody back at the camp talking about it.
Get the hell back on that cut.
Cullen Bohannon? Did you hear about Daniel Johnson's murder? Who wants to know? Why you so spooked, son? I guess I still ain't quite cottoned to the sight of Union blue riding up on me.
Well, you ought to be happy to see us.
Yeah, why is that? The boss wants to talk to you about taking Johnson's job.
Come on.
Here you go, Mickey.
:: Thanks.
:: Yeah.
I thank thee, Lord, for this bounty you have placed before me.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Horse thief.
Thor Gundersen.
Head of security for Mr Thomas Durant.
They call me The Swede.
I'm Norwegian.
But no matter.
We are all Americans now.
Hmm? Even you rebels, yes? Daniel Johnson told me that the two of you was cut from the same cloth.
Yeah, I don't think so.
Why is that? Did you not like him? He's my boss.
That's about all there was to it.
And drinking companion, yes? We tore it up some.
I understand the two of you was tearing it up some on the night he was murdered.
In fact, you were seen leaving the saloon with him.
Hmm? Yeah.
I'm not here to talk about Johnson's job, am I? Is that what they told you? You a law man, Mr Swede? Hmm? Because I don't see no badge.
No.
There's no official law out here yet.
Then what authority you got to be interrogating me? Mr Durant has appointed me to bring some order to the chaos out here.
When was the last time you took a look outside, Mr Swede? Looks to me like chaos is winning.
Well, when harlots and dipsomaniacs are killed, I lose not a minute's sleep.
But Daniel Johnson was a valuable asset to Mr Durant.
Daniel Johnson was hated by just about every man who worked for him.
Any with a reason to kill him? Perhaps one of the Negroes? I heard he had some trouble with them.
I don't know nothing about that.
Hmm Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, that leaves only you then.
You know what? I'm done here.
This ain't no court.
This here's Beauty.
She's an old piece, but she still shoots true.
I'm gonna give you a chance to confess to this crime.
Where is she? Hello, little brother.
What are you doing way out here? Where's the woman? I don't have her.
Yet.
You kill white men, it's one thing.
But you take one of their women, you'll have every damn one of them hunting you down.
I'll count coup and get more scalps.
I hope it was worth it.
What about the scalps you took? You act so pure now, but I remember there was a time when you loved the taste of blood.
Jesus has forgiven me for that.
Jesus may have forgiven you, but do you think your white friends would? You better find her before I do.
Hey.
Hey! You'd be surprised how fast you get used to the feel of them things.
What the hell are you doing here? Want to know if you fixing to be testifying on me.
I don't know, ain't decided yet.
I know about that sergeant.
Heard Johnson say some other things, too.
Things about men getting killed in churches and such.
Yeah, what's your point? Point is, if I be hanging for Johnson, you gonna drop down right beside me for them folks you done killed.
Tell you what.
You tell your story, and then I'll tell mine.
We'll see who they believe.
Yeah.
Who would believe some nigger slave over a white man? Relax, son.
Ain't nobody hanging nobody.
I ain't your damn son.
Well, I'll be out of here by tomorrow.
I imagine that's what that horse thief done said.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Thanks so much.
See you again.
:: Good luck.
:: Cheers.
Good luck.
Did you enjoy the show, sir? Very moving images of home, boys.
But you don't sound Irish.
I ain't, but my heart was moved nonetheless.
We're all yearning for our homeland out here in this strange place.
Excuse me, sir, have we met? We have not.
Folks around here call me The Swede.
You got yourself a prime location here, boys.
Yes, sirree.
Right between the whores and the liquor.
Picked it out meself.
What is it you want, Mr Swede? I like that, right to the point.
And the point is, a nice location like this got a nice price attached to it.
I should have realized there was a reason this spot wasn't taken.
:: I should have seen this coming.
- I take it, then, you're the smart one.
:: Aye.
:: Aye.
So, how much do you want, Mr Swede? Once again, right to the point.
Two dollars a week.
The first payment due this Friday.
But that's half our flipping take.
Now, for this two dollars, you shall have my protection against all the villains that surround you in this wicked place.
And what if we don't pay? Well, you can always move down to the slaughterhouse.
And what if we refuse to move? And I thought you was the smart one.
I used to be a bookkeeper.
:: you look like a bookkeeper.
:: Mmm.
I was always more comfortable around numbers than people.
I could control numbers.
The war put a stop to that, didn't it? You're suffering from the soldier's heart, Mr Swede.
Yeah, I can see it in your eyes.
You're still fighting them battles.
I saw no battles.
I was a quartermaster.
More numbers.
I never even saw the enemy until our supply train was captured and I become prisoner of war.
Andersonville? That's right.
Way down in the great state of Georgia.
Total chaos ruled.
I weighed 200 pounds when I went in and 86 when I come out.
I just couldn't make them numbers add up.
I woke one night to one of my own men trying to eat the flesh from my arm.
He thought I was dead.
I realized that night I had to control people like I control numbers, and I learned to practice a sort of immoral mathematics.
And I did some Not so good things in Andersonville, Mr Bohannon.
In the end, I found I was able to make them numbers add up.
So, have you thought about that confession? Well, I figure, by your math, you're gonna hang me either way.
Yeah.
You know why that man didn't finish eating your sorry ass? Hmm? 'Cause you Yankees all taste like shit.
Ah! Get right with your maker, Mr Bohannon.
Soon as we cut down the horse thief, you're gonna hang.
Write this down.
Outnumbered 5-to-1, eight white Christian souls were brutally slaughtered by the marauding, bloodthirsty war party of merciless savages.
Outnumbered 5-to-1 ? Make it 10-to-1.
Amongst the murdered were Robert Bell, visionary surveyor of the Union Pacific Railroad.
His beautiful wife Lily, the Fair-Haired Maiden of the West, was sullied by the savage pack, then carried off into slavery in their filthy camp What does  sullied  mean again? It will mean whatever the reader wants it to mean.
My road will bring civilization to these untamed western lands.
And the Fair-Haired Maiden of the West represents nothing less than civilization itself.
You see this as sort of a rallying cry? Yes.
Now you're getting it.
Save her at all costs.
Well, yes, of course, save her.
But I also want the federal troops brought in here to clear every single last savage from the path of my road.
Welcome, brother.
You must be that fellow they're looking to hang.
You know, Saint Peter himself was chained like this and condemned to die.
And he was freed by an angel.
I ain't no Saint Peter, sir.
Yeah, and I ain't no angel.
Peace be with you, sir.
And with you, Reverend.
And with you.
I hear your prisoner escaped.
We'll find him.
It's just a matter of time.
I'll be sure to keep an eye out for him.
You be careful.
He's a dangerous man.
Brother, we need to talk.
I thought you were gonna turn me in.
No.
The Lord instructs me to give sanctuary even to the condemned.
Yeah? What does he say about cutting off a pair of cuffs, huh? You're on your own there.
You know, you'd best set things straight in your heart before you go a-swinging, son.
They ain't gonna hang me.
Well, nevertheless, one day your name will be called.
And on that day, you must answer.
I know it.
Yeah? What are you gonna say? I did the best I could in a bad time.
Now, see, I understand that better than you know, but it won't be good enough for him.
So, all you got to do is get down on your knees Yeah.
I seen plenty of men get down on their knees and call out his name in terrible times.
I seen their prayers answered with a bullet more often than not.
It's hard to comprehend, I Son, I know.
It's impossible sometimes, but But he is here, and his mercy knows no bounds.
So just bend them knees and ask for forgiveness.
No, sir.
I won't do it.
Because the war took your faith? Because I don't deserve forgiveness.
Oi! We can't use that.
Ma would understand.
And what about next week and the week after? This ain't gonna stop.
There's nothing we can do about this bastard.
That's what you said in Boston.
I thought you said we were never to speak of that.
I got us out of that, I'll get us out of this.
But how? I don't know yet.
We'll figure something.
One day we'll send this to Ma and it'll be as thick as a brick.
My hand to God.
I had some jackrabbit in me, too.
Master gave me a nice pair of bracelets to sleep in.
Somebody put you in chains, the natural thing to do is try to escape.
Ain't I right? Ain't I right? Yeah.
You're right.
Let's go.
They're coming.
You gonna make a run for it? I ain't leaving.
They'll find you.
Not where I'm going.
So, it's true.
Mmm-hmm.
All of them? Everyone but the woman.
Them Injuns get her? I don't know.
Put the word out, $100 reward for anyone who finds her.
But not a word about the maps.
Yeah.
Mr Durant.
Who the hell are you? Cullen Bohannon, the man they're looking to hang.
For killing Johnson? I suppose you're here to tell me you're innocent? No, sir.
I'm here to ask for his job.
How do you put your trousers on, son? Sir? Over those big balls of yours? Two minutes.
That's all I ask.
Two minutes.
Did you fight in the war, Mr Durant? I served my country in other ways.
Well, building this railroad ain't much different than the war.
You got an army out there, and they need a leader.
I take it you fought for the South, Mr Bohannon.
Yes, sir.
And that's exactly why you need to hire me.
You're going to have to explain that to me.
I can't remember a time I wasn't outgunned, outmanned, or out-supplied fighting you Yankees, but I damn sure whooped your asses more often than not.
:: Is that so? - Yes, sir.
My men rode to hell and back for me, Mr Durant.
That's why you need me out here.
What do you know about building railroads? Well, I had to learn how they was built so I could figure out best how to blow them up.
You remember the Baltimore and Ohio Bridge over the Monocacy River? I built that bridge before the war.
I blew the whole thing up using half a keg of black powder.
But I'm done destroying things, Mr Durant.
I want to help you build this railroad.
Why should I trust my railroad to a grayback? You didn't have too much trouble trusting graybacks when you was smuggling cotton out of Mississippi during the war, now did you? You walk a fine line, son.
Forty miles, Mr Durant.
Ain't no secret you got to lay 40 miles of usable track before your government money kicks in.
Now, you and I both know that you ain't gonna get there going at this rate.
You don't get that $16,000 a mile, this whole thing goes belly up.
You're fighting a war, Mr Durant.
No doubt about it.
You need me to help you win it.
Son of a bitch.
What the hell are you doing, man? He's the son of a bitch who killed Johnson.
We gonna hang him.
Nonsense.
This is my new foreman.
Find me someone else to hang.
You're the new foreman? Yeah.
Johnson's things still in there? Yeah.
You want me to clear it out? Leave it.
Yes, sir.
Good morning, sinners.
I can say that because I'm a sinner, too.
I know the dark path of drink and debauchery.
I traveled it well.
Yeah, but now I'm on the path to God's light.
And I invite every last one of you to come along.
All are welcome.
Black, white, sinner or saint.
Even you papists.
All are welcome in God's house.
Thank you, Father.
I mean, Reverend.
I'm glad our dear, sweet mother wasn't here to see that.
What? Just being polite.
Why you always on me ass? The house was half full last night.
Be half again tomorrow.
What do you want me to do about it? Worry about it.
Like I do.
The Swede will come calling, you know, sooner rather than later.
That must be the new girl.
The savage one.
- What do you mean? - Haven't you heard? Mr Toole told me the whole story.
She was but a girl, white as we, taken captive years ago.
Sold to the highest heathen bidder, she was.
Some say she was a slave.
Others claim she be an Indian princess.
Will you stop with your tall tales? She's just a whore, Mick.
Well, then go talk to her, you bastard.
Make me a liar.
Go on.
Good morning to ya.
He buy the man a drink first, that's what I hear.
He buy the man a drink, take him out and goes savage as a meat axe on him, you hear me? He didn't kill Johnson.
They was gonna hang him.
They didn't.
Yet.
Good day, Mr Bohannon, sir.
A fine day, is it not? Fine or not.
Guess we got a good day's work ahead of us.
Mr Kretschmar.
I need that rail end leveled down to the next marker.
Mr Toole, I need you and your men down at the end of the iron.
Looks like the train's bringing down that load of ties, all right? Yes, sir, Mr Bohannon, sir.
Elam, - I need you and your men - It's Mr Ferguson.
Elam.
You and your men get down in the cut.
I need men.
Men not afraid of the heathens, men not afraid of making some money.
What is this about? The fair-haired maiden of the west.
Mrs Lily Bell, she has been taken captive by the Cheyenne dog soldiers.
A Mr Durant has promised a bounty to the men who rescue her.
Ain't nobody going nowheres.
Or there won't be a job waiting for you when you get back.
Dix will take a party north, Bolan, south.
You.
:: You.
:: Yeah.
:: You.
:: I told You.
I can't spare these men.
Mr Durant wants her found.
Mr Durant wants a railroad built.
You and you.
No, this ain't happening.
Boss man, let 'em go.
We can do their work and our work.
You get your men and you get the hell out of here.
One more thing.
I'm looking for a man named Harper, Frank Harper.
He's a friend of Johnson's.
I got something for him.
I believe he's out with the logging crew.
Where's that? Well, it must be 15, 20 miles west of the cut by now.
Is that a bullet? What? What you got for Sergeant Harper? Ain't you got some work to do? Yours and theirs? Get to it.
The people, they are scared.
The Indian massacre.
They seen the bodies, heard the stories.
Your stories.
I need troops.
Seven men we lost last night.
Left the employ of the Union Pacific, some on the train, others just ran off.
More tonight, I expect.
Seems the men prefer to keep their scalps on their heads.
Are you afraid? - No, sir, Mr - What about you? - Well, as a matter of fact, I - Enough.
Now, why do you wanna shit on my railroad? Well, under our current pace, we won't make the 40-mile mark.
So, what I would propose is we straighten the route.
The route remains the same.
But, Mr Durant, as I understand it, the deadline has been pushed up.
And in light of Central Pacific's recent advances Keep to the plan.
I'll make it a reality.
Yes, sir, Mr Durant.
You're amused? No, sir.
I'm just looking forward to watching, yet again, as you smite the forces agin you.
The search continues? For the maps? Yeah.
For the woman, Lily Bell.
I've got my men out despite Mr Bohannon.
Still more concerned about your killer than my railroad? No, sir.
But whoever cut Daniel Johnson's throat is an ongoing concern.
More importantly, is my new foreman building my railroad? He is.
Yet there is something about the man that does not quite add up.
To, Jordan Crane, Washington, DC.
Stop.
Honorable Senator, work continues at a fever pace.
Stop.
However, hostile Native action threatens progress.
Stop.
The march of civilization in jeopardy.
Stop.
To heal the nation, we must displace the savage.
Stop.
Otherwise, the savage will displace us.
Mrs Bell? Mrs Bell? Whoa, boy.
You speak English? Yes, sir.
Move.
Who are you? Joseph Black Moon.
You Cheyenne? Christian.
Whoa, whoa.
Hold steady.
I'm unarmed, sir.
What did you do to her? - I I didn't do - Hey.
Hey.
What did you do to her? I saved her.
From the Indians? Yes, sir.
She took an arrow to the shoulder.
I'm trying to take her to the railroad to see the doctor.
When this happen? Two, maybe three days ago.
All right.
My horse, there's a field kit in the saddle bag.
Here.
Hold her down.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hold her down.
Hey, stop! Stop it! Hold on.
Now, the man say we gotta do our work and theirs.
But I ask ya, why ain't that Negro ass down here with us? Y'all know who he is, that's all I'm saying.
Back in the day Them days was bad.
Don't get me wrong.
Massah drove me hard.
Nearly drove me to the grave.
You hear me? Some things was better back then.
:: At least you knew your place.
:: Psalms!Less talk, more work.
Bust me some stone, Negro.
How 'bout I bust me your head? You got something to say to me? Yes, I do.
What would that be? How come we got to do the white man work, huh? Oh, that's right, 'cause you think you is the white man, not the high yeller house nigger you is.
We got to do their work and our work.
But this ain't for them.
This is for us.
White man ain't gonna give you nothing, because they want us to fall.
They all want us to fall.
Hey.
Sir? Are you leaving? Yeah.
Somewheres I gotta be.
Thank you for helping her.
Yep.
Whoa.
Damn it.
You ain't thought this thing through, have you? What do you mean? Indian brings that woman back to town, Indian don't get out alive.
But I live there, at the church.
You don't get it, do ya, boy? They brought them back in yesterday on a buckboard.
Everybody's seen what they did to them bodies.
Why cut 'em up? Huh? What do you people get out of it? Your people have done much worse.
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe.
But that ain't gonna keep 'em from skinning your ass alive, you bring that white woman back to town.
I'll have to take her.
Explain to me how I work harder than them, and they go to bed with three more dollars in their pocket than I do.
That don't make a lick of sense.
Well, it don't.
We work as hard as them, right? Damn right.
Then why don't we get the same reward? You crazy.
We deserve a taste, too.
Huh? We can't go in there.
You ain't one of them nancy boys, is you, Psalms? Now, I know you get horny, I hear you back behind that tent every night.
Damn, boy, you gonna go blind.
Lookee here.
You go in there, you coming out on the bad end of a rope.
You ain't scared, is ya? You're damn right I'm scared.
Well, I ain't.
She had a face like a hatchet and an ass like a Venus, I tell you.
Just what do you want, you mule-colored bastard? Spend some hard-earned money, same as you.
Same as me, he says.
Have you looked in the mirror lately, Mr Ferguson? You think we the same, well, then, you got a big surprise coming, I tell you.
Face like a coal scuttle, he has.
Why don't you just mind your damn business? You the man to make me? Well, if it ain't Mr Toole.
Watch out, ladies, he's back.
We call him  The Blade,  for he'll gut you like a trout.
And who would you be? Your next customer.
Look at him, can't even land a cheap-ass whore been plowed by every heathen buck in the territory.
Is this what you're looking for? My shoulder's feeling much better.
Where's Joseph? He took off.
Why? Ma'am, it is way too late and way too wet to be trying to figure out some Indian, all right? I regret we haven't been properly introduced.
Cullen Bohannon.
I work for the railroad.
Have I done something? It ain't what you done.
It's who you are.
What do you mean? You ain't whore nor squaw.
You shouldn't be out here.
You don't know who I am, or what I'm capable of.
No, I don't, and I sure as hell don't care.
Request for military support to be taken under advisement.
Very concerned regarding lack of progress.
Need to understand impact of surveyor loss.
The Honorable Senator is very concerned.
If he were in my shoes, he'd be downright suicidal.
Ah! Damn.
Henri? Your look of disdain reminds me of my dear wife back in New York.
What Hannah failed to grasp is that where most men seek the warm glow that only whiskey can provide, I imbibe to fuel a conflagration.
There's a fire in my belly which must be fed.
Otherwise, we'll never see the Pacific.
And did your wife accept this excuse, Monsieur Durant? As a matter of fact, she didn't.
Sorry, mate.
You missed the last show, I'm afraid.
Oh! Very well.
I see.
Mr Durant, sir, an honor and a pleasure.
This is quite an establishment you've got here.
I'm only sorry you're closed for the night.
Next show begins at dusk tomorrow.
Quiet, you daft bastard.
This is Thomas  Doc  Durant.
A private view he'll be having.
Thank you.
:: How much? - that will be five Dollars.
The going rate for a private show.
Mickey, show time! I have followed your exploits and investments since I got off the boat.
How you rose up from nothing, pulled yourself up by your bootstraps.
You're a gentleman and a true capitalist.
Thank you.
Hmm.
I assume you two are immigrants from this beautiful country? Aye.
From County Wicklow, to be exact.
We left our sweet mother and four brothers and set out for the new world to seek our fortune.
You left a beautiful life to come and wallow in this filth and squalor and muck.
Well, it beats starving to death.
No, but you could have remained in New York or Boston or Chicago.
There's plenty of work to be had.
Yet you chose to come here.
Makes me wonder why.
I'm not quite sure what you mean, sir.
Well, you and thousands like you have followed me out here and I'm genuinely curious.
Why? Well, sir It seemed a proper investment of our time and efforts.
MICKEY: That's not it at all.
I remember it well.
Like it was yesterday.
What are you talking about? What is it you remember? We were just lads, me and Sean, never been much further afield than the bit of land our father worked, God rest him.
And one day, we heard the whistle, and it was the Dublin special on its daily run.
Well, we jumped the steaming bastard.
It took us all the way to the city.
Yes, I remember.
I never felt so free.
The railroad gave you freedom.
Aye.
And our father gave us the whipping of a lifetime.
I prayed you'd stay away, my son.
This is my home.
Not a very safe one right now for one born out of the grace of God.
But I'm baptized, Father.
Yeah, well, that does not always sway the cruel prejudice of others.
It's not your fault.
But it is.
They were from my band.
Our dog soldiers, they're the ones that did this.
Your family had nothing to do with this.
I recognized the arrows, Father.
It was my brother.
You must tell no one.
Never speak of this again.
But it's the truth.
Never.
Well, there you are, kitty cat.
What do you want? We want you.
We've been searching over hill and dale for the fair-haired maiden of the west.
We've come to rescue ya.
Thank you, no.
I'm quite all right.
No, you ain't.
You barely escaped massacre.
You've been held captive.
You've been sullied by the heathen.
You're out of order, sir.
Listen, you ain't come with us, we ain't get compensated.
Yeah, there's a bounty on your head now, Go ahead.
Easy now, girl.
:: you just take it easy.
:: Stay back.
:: Easy now.
- Stay back! Now, you're making this a lot more unpleasant than it has to be.
Miss Bell! Damn it.
Come on! My ear! My ear! My ear! Where is it? Whoa.
Whoa, hold up there.
Death's no stranger to this godforsaken place.
Death abides in the hard labor of a rail gang, or the searing heat of a prairie fire.
Death abides at the bottom of a whiskey bottle or the smoking end of a gun.
There's death by famine, flood or pestilence and a thousand other ways.
But, yes, brothers, death abides and he will reap his dark harvest.
But must we be death's accomplice? Must we do his bidding? I know that your hearts seek vengeance for the deaths of those men, I know that, but haven't we had our fill of war? Our fill of killing? Shedding of blood?  And they will hammer their swords into plowshares.
And their spears into pruning hooks.
Nations will not lift up swords against nation.
And never again will they learn war.
Never again.
It's Isaiah 2:4.
Wake up the mighty men,  let all the men of war draw near.
Hammer your plowshares into swords.
And your pruning hooks into spears.
Joel 3: 10.
I, too, am sick of war, Reverend.
But we must consistently ask ourselves,  What is worth fighting for?  What is worth laying our lives on the line for? Robert Bell gave his life for this undertaking, this grand idea, and I assure you, he did not give his life in vain.
For he knew what this railroad would mean to us as a nation.
He knew this railroad is a new birth of freedom.
Not just the freedom of long-distance travel, but the freedom to choose your fate, the freedom to make your fortunes in this untamed land.
And we cannot let that freedom be threatened by ragtag bands of marauding Stone Age primitives.
But that is not to say that there is not a peaceful solution.
If they will put down their sticks and stones and come into the fold, like this young man here, then we will talk peace.
Now, look at him, wearing our clothes, speaking our language, washed in the blood of our savior.
If these violent nomads roaming the plains are willing to do as he has done, then there is very real hope that our mission might be accomplished peacefully.
If not, then they are the authors of their own destruction.
LILY: It's been months since I've seen such a Shit hole? Whoa.
Will you be all right from here? You're not taking me in? There's a church and the doctor straight on up ahead.
Wait.
What about the bounty? I told ya, I got business to attend to, Cheyenne territory.
About four hours of daylight left, gotta move.
Mr Bohannon?
Anybody there? Drop the rifle.
Turn around.
:: you Harper? - No, sir.
Where is he? Who wants to know? I'm your new foreman.
Why should I believe you? I guess Mr Durant didn't have time to come out and tell you his self.
Durant? - Yeah, he told me to come look for Harper.
- Why? That's his business.
Where is he? Harper hightailed it.
:: When? - a few hours ago.
:: Which way? - North.
Towards the ridge.
- Is it true about Johnson? - Yeah, it's true.
What's the world coming to, sir? The world ain't coming to nothing, son.
Same as it ever was.
Harper! Harper! Is that you? Whoa! Shit.
Mrs Bell? Mrs Bell, it's me, Thomas Durant.
They said you were up here.
I know who you are, Mr Durant.
The whole world's been looking for you and here you are.
And here I am.
You must excuse my appearance.
We need to get you some medical attention.
Please, allow me to escort you.
You You won't need this anymore.
Your ordeal is over.
My deepest condolences on your loss, Mrs Bell.
Thank you.
How in God's name did you make your way back here? Oh.
Can't remember his name A Southerner, I think.
:: Bohannon? - Yes, I believe so.
Did I tell ya about me rendezvous with the tattooed harlot? The scarlet whore of Babylon had nothing on this lass, I tell ya.
Give us the particulars, man.
I have never seen nothing like it in all me life, boys.
She used her organ like a velvet hand on me tallywhacker.
And to hear her tell it, she's practiced these dark arts of love on all manner of beasts and men.
Chinks, monkeys and horses have all known the pleasure of her touch.
In fact, there is but one creature in all the world with whom she refuses to copulate.
And what would that be? Well, the common American nigger, of course.
- Damn it, I've heard enough - Hey, hey, hey, hey! All right.
Never thought I'd see you again.
You kill him? Where you going? Sooner or later, you gotta give us some orders, boss man.
The demise of Head Surveyor Robert Bell and party a great loss to railroad.
Stop.
Bell's work must continue.
Stop.
Send funds for new surveyors at once.
Stop.
What news? Payroll is late.
Work disorganized and slow.
This new foreman of yours just up and leave yesterday.
Nobody seen him since.
He rode out to rendezvous with a tree-cutting party.
He informed me yesterday at our morning briefing.
There is something about this man.
He's up to something.
:: He crossed paths with Mrs Bell.
:: Bohannon? He brought her in.
- Did she have the maps? - Shh! She's right next door.
She didn't have them.
How do we reach the Pacific without them? You let me worry about that.
Oh! There's a supply train arriving tomorrow morning with a shipment of black powder.
My men will meet the train and guard it all morning.
New telegram, to my damn stock broker.
Invest $147,000 in R&R Railroad stock as discussed.
Stop.
Mrs Bell? Are you all right in there? Yes, thank you, Mr Durant.
I I brought out my Personal chef from Delmonico's in New York City.
I wondered if you would like to join me for dinner this evening? Yes, that would be wonderful.
Is there anything else I can get for you? Actually, has the reward been given to anyone? I believe it belongs to Mr Bohannon.
I don't think he's claimed it.
:: Would you like me to see that He gets it? - No.
There's someone else who deserves it.
Stay off my corner, sweetheart.
Unless she wants her own crib, right, ladies? You leave her alone.
What do you say, blondie? Them Injuns teach you anything? Mind that mouth! Hey, I'm sorry, ma'am.
These dirty whores don't know a lady when they see one.
Where there is hatred, let me show love.
Where there is injury, pardon.
Where there is doubt, faith.
Amen.
:: Joseph? - Mrs Bell.
You look like you're feeling much better.
It's amazing what a little soap and water can do.
I didn't mean to leave that night.
:: but that man - No.
There's no need to explain.
- You've cut your hair.
- Yes, ma'am.
:: Did you come to pray? - No, I came to give you this.
It's the reward money.
No, please, take it.
I can't.
There'll be no trouble, nobody knows it was you.
No, that's not it.
I'm not a bounty hunter.
- It's my duty to help.
:: Joseph, that money will buy a lot of Bibles.
Mrs Bell, Reverend Cole.
:: Reverend.
:: your donations are always welcome.
Please.
Thank you.
So, this is the fair-haired maiden of the West? I beg your pardon?  Robert Bell fought valiantly to save the virtue of his beautiful wife,  killing a savage with his final breath.
:: Is that not How it happened? - Yes.
My husband saved my life.
Well, what about the rest of it? Outnumbered 10-to-one? - Sullied by the savages? - I didn't write it.
:: Right, but Is this true? - of course not.
Well, Indians will die as a result of this.
The Indians attacked us.
If they die, they will be to blame, not me.
Maybe you've heard of the Sand Creek Massacre? I didn't come here to speak of this.
You know, the Cheyenne were flying the American flag over their camp and it didn't stop the U.
S.
Calvary from killing 100 innocent women and children.
It's a terrible thing that happened.
I wasn't a part of it.
No, no, please, I'm just saying, try to see the bigger picture.
My husband was slaughtered right in front of me.
It's a little difficult to see the bigger picture.
Good day.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey! That sumbitch got away because of you.
Cause of me? How you figure that? You killed Johnson before he could give me Harper's name.
:: What? - I killed Johnson before He killed You.
No.
And I would have got a name out of him.
And he would have blowed your brains out.
And then I could have killed Harper before he had a chance to run.
You're either drunk or crazy or both.
You have any idea what they took from me? They ain't took nothing from you that ain't been took from me.
Fly away home, just a nickel a show.
Feel the mist against your cheeks.
Give it a rest, Mick.
They're sick and bloody tired of the mighty Shannon and the Blarney Stone.
The bloody Irish bog.
:: Well, then we need new slides.
:: new slides cost money.
You've got some copper squirreled away, Brother, now's the time to tell me.
Maybe we should relocate.
The rent is low down by the slaughterhouse, right? The rent was low in Wicklow, too, Mick.
Ah! We're done with that shite.
Twas a high-rent dream that brought us out here.
I'm not going to let that big Swedish bastard kill our dream.
Am I right? Mick? MICKEY: Hold on now.
I just had a grand idea.
:: Oh, No.
- It's a business idea.
Ideas ain't your strong suit, Mick.
This one's golden.
I'll prove it to ya.
I've taken the liberty of telegraphing your family in England.
:: I just wanted them to know you were well.
:: Thank you, Mr Durant.
I'm afraid you'll grow weary of my gratitude.
I don't know what news of the attack may have reached them.
I didn't want your father worrying needlessly.
I'm sure my father was happy to hear he was right.
About me coming to America.
He was against it, no doubt? My father had every aspect of my life planned out, including whom I should marry.
Robert interrupted those plans.
I saw him give a lecture at the British Museum of Natural History.
He spoke of the American West.
I fell in love.
With him and with this land.
I, too, came under Robert's spell.
His dream of a transcontinental railroad became my own.
Then it's a shame you two had such a terrible falling out.
Well, Robert and I didn't see eye to eye on everything.
Such as how to squeeze every last dollar out of the railroad.
Mrs Bell, your husband was a starry-eyed dreamer.
I am a realist.
Without me, his dream would have remained just that.
Thank you for your hospitality, Mr Durant.
Mrs Bell, please, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to impugn Robert.
Yes, he needed me, but I needed him also.
Our marriage wasn't perfect, but it worked.
Mrs Bell, there's nowhere for you to go out there.
Please, accept my apology.
Do me the honor of remaining my guest.
Why you following me? You trying to get me killed? Mister, you do that all by yourself busting in on a white cathouse.
What you want then? Huh? You still want to give me a roll? I thought you were mighty clear on where you stood on that.
Honey, I'm already a cut-rate whore on account of my beauty marks.
My white customers know I laid with a colored fella, I starve.
But, if you got a dollar, then maybe we can do one off the books.
Now you trying to get us both killed.
Look at him.
Drop your hanky Madam? Now, now, boys.
I doubt Mr Durant wants his new foreman assassinated.
He shot my dang ear off, Swede.
Too bad it was not your tongue.
Move aside.
Mr Bolan, you need to leave here, right now.
Damn it.
Come on, Tommy, let's go.
Let's go.
Come on.
Magnolias, they grow just outside the gates of the Andersonville.
Some nights, their perfume was almost enough to mask the awful stench.
You're a difficult man to cipher, Mr Bohannon.
Let me buy you a drink.
I won't turn down free liquor.
:: need another glass.
:: Thank You.
No.
I know you killed Johnson.
What I do not know yet is why.
Who are you? Hmm? Ah! I'll figure it out.
You let me know when you do, all right? Oh, by golly, you will be the first to know.
Hmm? But in the meantime, I've got a A business proposition for you.
Now, there is a There is some black powder coming in on the train tomorrow morning.
That is your cut.
And you just look the other way while my boys unload Well, a few barrels.
Is that some of that immoral mathematics, Mr Swede? Huh? All right.
:: you got a deal.
:: Yeah.
For another five.
Hmm.
Oh! Well, well, well.
Look here.
How them Injuns treat you? Well, they were people.
You know what people are like.
Some of them are good and some of them ain't so good.
What about the ones that put that mark on you? Well, this wasn't that bad.
:: Did it hurt? - not as much as a lot of things.
Folk be telling all kind of tales about what that mean.
Well, what do you think it means? I reckon it mean you was a slave, just like me.
It's three blankets and a horse.
That's what I was worth to them.
Them eyes of yours alone worth 100 horses.
They was fools.
Maybe there's another way of looking at it.
Maybe this mark was their way of giving me their name, telling the world that I was one of them.
Hmm.
I got my master name, too, but I sure as hell ain't one of them.
Best I can tell, you ain't one of nobody or nothing.
Just like you? We're like two peas in a pod, huh? Forty miles, 40 miles.
Who came up with that number? It's completely arbitrary.
I don't have enough to worry about with the savages and the cutthroats I have working for me.
It must be hard to be you.
Those milksops in Washington, I beg them for more troops, but get none.
And my investors, do you think they'll give me even a penny for new surveyors? Mmm.
They haven't got your guts, Thomas.
Robert was a lucky man to have you at his side.
Thomas, are the new surveyors to finish Robert's work? Yes, this time.
Forgive me.
I thought the lion's share of Robert's work was finished.
Yes, it was, but he still owed me some surveys.
I think he was keeping them from me because of our falling out.
I see.
What kind of surveys? There.
LILY: The Rocky Mountains? It's a 14,000-foot barrier of stone and snow.
But I think Robert knew the way through.
But when you didn't have his maps, I Oh You poor man.
You must have been crushed.
I was.
That's not to say I wasn't elated to see you safe and sound.
Let's have a song, shall we? Henri? Dark night here in Hell, brothers and sisters.
Come on in.
I got eggs, I got coffee, I got scripture.
Oh, Mr Bohannon.
Hi, Mr Bohannon.
Did the good Lord save you from hanging so you could drown yourself in whiskey? It's a little late for proselytizing, ain't it, Preacher? You know, you were right.
You know, you don't deserve forgiveness.
:: Yeah.
:: Neither Did I.
Yet I I stand here, my wickedness washed away by the blood of the Lamb.
The hell you know about wickedness? You ever hear of Bleeding Kansas? You know, I rode with martyr John Brown.
John Brown was a cold-blooded killer.
You in a position to throw stones on that account, Mr Bohannon? That's right.
Cause, you know, one night, you authored the deaths of five men.
Slave owners.
We pulled them from their homes and butchered them with broadswords.
You know, drunkard I was, I I neglected to put an edge on On my blade.
It was hard work, brother, but I I kept a-hacking and a-hacking and a-hacking till I couldn't hack no more.
Now, that's Bleeding Kansas.
Why didn't you just shoot them? The mercy of a bullet was something they didn't deserve.
Well, I owned slaves.
Yeah, well, lucky for you you weren't in Kansas that night.
No, Preacher.
It's lucky for you.
No one deserves forgiveness, brother.
That's the beauty of grace.
Yeah.
I thank you for the sermon, Preacher.
I used to be a lot like you, Cullen.
The only difference was I had a cause.
What is yours? Yeah, John Brown's dead.
That's right.
Yeah, I believe we hung his sorry ass.
# I wish I was in the land of cotton # Old times there are not forgotten # Look away, look away # Look away, Dixie Land.
Careful with this stuff, boys.
Hey.
You got a brick in your hat this morning, boss man? That hill we coming up on don't meet grade.
We either gotta blow it or go around.
Blow it.
My men ain't never handled that black powder.
It ain't my problem.
You ain't no better than Johnson, you know that? How come every time I turn around, you're knee deep in my business? 'Cause you the boss.
I want to keep my job.
You better get to work, then.
You got men ready to work but there ain't no supplies or no foreman.
You got to get up off your ass and get out there.
The black powder is on the damn supply train.
I ain't your master.
You wanted freedom, you got it.
Figure it out your damn self.
Mick, where the hell you been? Makin' us some money, Sean-O.
Right this way, lads.
You won't be disappointed, I promise.
Hey, hey, hey.
No shoving.
One at a time.
Everyone will get his turn now.
Right.
Go on.
What do you see? Are ya daft, Mick? What? It's brilliant.
It's a nickel a peep, the show's always changing and there's no need for new slides.
You know, there's a lot of uncontrollable factors.
Hey, hey! This ain't no peep show.
Get out of here, you hobos and you coal crunchers.
You pay your $3 like everyone else! - Jesus.
- Get! How's about a kiss for us instead? How's about you kiss my whore ass, you thick Irish bogtrotter! Get! Good morning.
I trust you had a decent night's sleep? This is the first bed I've slept in in a long time.
I'm sorry for my behavior last night.
- I'm afraid I had too much to drink.
- Oh, please don't apologize.
I enjoyed myself immensely.
And today I was hoping to see more of your railroad, what you've accomplished, what lies ahead.
After all, your passion for this great enterprise was an inspiration.
Well, in that case, you shall have the grand tour, my dear.
That is, if you're well enough to ride.
I believe Fall back.
Let's go! Run, Bolan, run! Move, move, move! Go bloody away! Get out of there! - Oh, shit.
:: Shut the hell up.
They're gonna blow! Ah! My leg! - My leg.
:: Quit your crying, madam.
Get the hell out of there! Come on, lads, pull it up.
Pick it up.
Pick it up.
Another bucket.
Another bucket.
That's the way, lads.
Keep going.
Careful now.
Hold his head.
May I? Lift the arm, put pressure on the vein.
:: There? Or here? - Up higher.
Right there.
:: you got it? - I think so.
All right.
I gotta go.
Stay with him.
All right! That's enough lollygagging around.
Rail crew better be hammering rail by the time I get to my horse! Cut crew out to the cut! Let's go! We got a hill to blow, boys.
Back to work!.
It is good to make this sacrifice where the sun can look down and see you.
It is a great privilege to dance with the sun.
The sacrifice will be hard, but you are strong and brave.
You will not give up, as I did not give up when my father brought me to this place.
Follow the sun all day and pray.
If you are strong and true, your sacrifice will be rewarded and you will have a vision.
Mighty fine job, Mr Bohannon.
Ahem.
Ma'am.
It's not your manners, Mr Bohannon.
It's your manner.
Beg your pardon? Yesterday, when everyone was running from the disaster, you walked calmly in.
You are their hero, Mr Bohannon.
Lily! I just heard from your father.
Everything is arranged.
I'm assuming you're here to see me? Yes, sir.
Payroll didn't come in on the train this morning.
Mr Bohannon, one of the reasons I spared your neck was because I thought you were a capable man.
Was I mistaken? No, sir, but the men are already grumbling about not getting their pay last week, sir.
Yes, well, see the Swede about petty cash.
Mr Durant, that won't cover the men's pay.
Of course not, you idiot.
It's for the walking bosses.
But keep quiet about it.
We don't want a riot on our hands.
So keep the men in line until you get your money trouble sorted out.
My problems are no concern of yours, Mr Bohannon.
Actually, today, Mr Durant, your troubles are mine.
But y'all go have yourselves a nice picnic, all right? Reverend? I can find someone else to help with this.
Just a moment to catch my breath.
Get the hell out of the way.
We need to ride out and speak to Many Horses immediately.
My father's people won't feel threatened by four men.
Well, these men are the eyes of the Union Army.
The tip of the spear.
Let's go.
Business has been slow, Mr Swede.
We will pay you though.
:: Yeah.
:: we just need a little more time.
Well, thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you for telling me that you are unable to pay what is owed.
I shall give you a little more time.
See, I told you Mr Swede was a reasonable man.
Yeah.
No, you didn't.
He just took one of our slides.
Are you sure we can find him? Yes.
But they're not going to be happy to see us.
Why is that? These rituals, they're not meant for white man's eyes.
Father? Father? It's Ruth.
Your daughter.
What are you doing here? Mother died.
I came to find you.
Well, we'll send you to the mission in Council Bluffs.
They'll take care of you.
:: the mission sent me here, they said - Yea.
You're not staying here.
I have nowhere else to go.
She can stay in the church tent.
At least till we get back.
I'll decide where you go when we return.
In the meantime, there's a bed in the back.
Thank you, Father.
How long has it been since you've seen her? Twelve, fifteen years.
I don't exactly recollect.
And you're just going to leave her here? In a place like this? You're right.
There are some things I need to tell you.
There's Bacon in the bear box and coffee and flour.
Don't let the drunks stumble in and sleep on the pews.
There's a butcher knife under that altar if you need it.
And just, you know, try to make yourself useful.
Don't leave the tent.
You know, unless, it's on fire.
Understood?  Either the roof or mum's hair  was set ablaze by the Harrigan brothers.
Those bastards.
Did they say if they were able to put the fire out? - What the hell is this strange wind? - The bloody last page is missing.
Jesus! It's a whirlwind! Where did you No, no, no, no! Bloody hell.
What are you I thought you said you were going to give us more time.
You asked for a little more time, and that's what I gave you, a little more time.
Ah! Put your backs into it there, boys! Come on, work, you mules.
Hey, up! I want all the walking bosses right here, right now.
Come on, Mr Toole.
Y'all are getting paid to work the men until the payroll situation gets figured out.
Again? If they aren't paid, they'll strike, Mr Bohannon.
Then you keep quiet as long as you can.
Hey, now, walking bosses only.
I am a walking boss.
Tell 'em you made me a walking boss.
Get back to work.
This about all you walking bosses getting paid again and we ain't getting paid again, right? Tell you what, you keep your mouth shut and you keep your job.
Get back to work.
Come on! Someone needs to put that boy in his place.
and yet I remain stranded here, blocked by the great Rocky Mountains.
The Rocky Mountains? They are some 500 miles from here.
Beyond that rise, the Platte River forks.
Do I follow it to the north or south? A mistake here and we could miss our strike on the Rockies by hundreds of miles.
I'm assuming you strike the mountains at any route you take.
The problem is not striking the mountains, Lily.
The problem is crossing the mountains.
And you think Robert was the only person who knew the way? It took him seven years and my open purse, but, yes, he told me he'd found it.
Surely there'll be other surveys? Oh, yes.
Yes, someone will build this railroad, but without the secret which Robert took to his grave, it will not be me.
If I'm remembered, it will be as the man who failed.
Unfortunately, Robert will probably not be remembered at all.
Pay up, I'm gonna buy me a double hot soak.
And liniment.
And a bottle of whiskey that don't burn going down.
We ain't getting paid.
Well, they ain't pay us last week.
I was figuring on double pay today.
You might as well put that tool down and go back to camp.
That's where I'm gonna be.
Hey! Hey! It ain't quitting time.
It is for me.
I done worked for free my whole life, I ain't doing that no more.
You get back in that cut.
Get down off that horse and put me in the cut.
I don't need some slave uprising on my hands this day.
That's how you see it? All I see is some field hand acting like a house boy.
Take off that gun.
Take it off.
:: come on.
:: give it to him now, boy!Excuse me.
Mr Bohannon! I hired you to run these men to build my railroad, not to wrestle in the dirt with your former chattel.
:: What Is the meaning of this? Payroll!Lack of.
And who told the men there is no payroll? I did.
Then you told them nonsense.
Gentlemen, I see that unfounded rumors have caused tempers to flare.
Believe me, the payroll is en route, merely delayed.
As for you and your sparring partner, Mr Bohannon, I suggest you settle your differences like the gentlemen I know you all to be.
This evening, when you have completed your work, I suggest a pugilistic match between Mr Bohannon and his Negro nemesis.
:: a real fight.
Yeah! Yeah! And to compensate you for the tardiness of your well-earned pay, I will donate 10 cases of whiskey for your refreshment.
I didn't know you had a daughter.
Well, now you know.
Why don't you ever speak of her? Are you really going to send her away? You know, Jesus says,  If any man come to me and not hate his father  and hate not his mother and his wife and his children and his own life,  then he cannot be my disciple.
I don't think I have enough hate in my heart to be a good Christian.
Whoa! Whoa! - Black Moon.
:: Father.
Why you have brought this man to our sacred place? He's putting a curse on you.
He calls you Black Spider because you trapped my son in your web.
Joseph came to Christ on his own free will.
Is that so? Tell me, do you have no children of your own? I had I have a daughter.
Who has just returned to him.
Praise God.
Where has she been? I left her.
You abandon your child and steal mine.
What kind of man are you? A flawed one.
Father, Reverend Cole has come because he's concerned for our people.
Chief, the soldiers have already come.
Yeah.
Four soldiers on horseback.
But more will come, enough to wipe out all the human beings from the world.
But there may be another way.
If you come to town, we discuss peace.
I will come, but only if my son Black Moon asks me to come.
Please come.
For me.
Come inside, gentlemen, and witness the greatest contest in the history of Hell on Wheels! The finest corn liquor, compliments of Mr Thomas Durant, President of the Union Pacific Railroad.
Hey, over here.
Give me one of those.
You must be able to spell your name to wager, you morons.
Now, who just flung down that silver? This here's enough peppers to make a Mexican cry.
It'll probably kill you.
MICKEY: Sean's putting everything we got on you.
I thought you were broke? We put the magic lantern up for collateral.
:: Sure that was a Good idea? - Sure.
The whole town's betting on you.
There's time enough if you want to place a bet on yourself.
No.
I ain't doing this for money, Mick.
Then why are you doing it? Hmm.
That man needs to be put in his place.
There's only one thing he understands.
What if, God forbid, you were to lose? That ain't gonna happen.
You win this fight, they're gonna kill you.
And if you lose, they're gonna kill you for thinking you could win.
You don't understand.
This is something I gotta do.
Why? Because you're half white or because you're half black? All my life folk been telling me who I am.
One white man tell me I'm a slave, another one say I'm free.
Tonight, I say who I am.
Hello.
Tonight and one night only, you will be allowed in.
One sign of misbehavior and I will throw you all in chains.
Understood? Good.
You are welcome.
Come in.
Yeah.
That's it.
Your corner here.
Mr Ferguson's corner.
Bloody hell.
Look at what the bowels of the place have shat out.
Get the bloody hell out.
What do you think you're doing? Make way for Mr Bohannon! Come on! Come on! You gonna win this fight, hear? You gonna win this fight for us.
You hear me? - Jesus, he is a big buck, Mr Bohannon.
- Ain't all about the brawn, Mick.
Now, this fight is going to be a fair fight.
No grappling below the waist.
No eyeball gouging.
No biting.
No unnecessary kicking.
Now, the fighters will come from their corners and toe this line.
Mr Dix is going to be the referee for this contest.
- No! Not fair! - Now, I assume both fighters are ready to fight.
Toes on! Come on! Fight! Keep them back, will you? All right, boys, back to your corners.
Back to your corners.
Thirty seconds! Out of the way.
Sit down.
The bank is denying the request for a credit extension.
Reply.
If credit not extended forthwith, will call in all shares of aforesaid bank stock to be joined by other four major investors.
Stop.
Anticipate collapse of bank by close of business tomorrow.
Stop.
And send.
Samson brought the temple down on his head.
I will happily do the same.
- Give him a fat lip, Mr Bohannon! - He already has two, lad! Get in there and fight, boy.
Fight! Get him! Knock him down! Get up now.
Come on, get up! Knock his nappy nigger ass out! Punch his black ass back to Africa! Get up! On your feet.
:: Get up.
:: Get up.
Are you gonna start fighting or what? - Huh? Come on, fight! Got to see this, now.
Break 'em up.
Stand 'em up.
Get up! Give us some room! Give us some room! Back it up! Get him to the corner, now.
Hell's wrong with you? - Are you seeing what I'm seeing? - What? He ain't fighting.
Hell's wrong with you, boy? Huh? Is it 'cause you ain't never hit no white man before? Is that it? Look here, son.
That man who sired you, that won't your father.
That white man who raped your mother.
Ya hear? Same man done beat you all your life with his foot on your neck.
Huh? Same man who say he your master when you supposed to be free.
Huh? Look over here.
That's him sitting on his soft white ass.
I want you go over there, and I want you to kill him.
You hear? You go kill him.
You ain't gonna do this for us.
Do this for you.
Take a knee, Mr Bohannon.
Take a knee! Come on! Come on! Come on! Back off! - Come on! - I knew you could do it! I told you, boy! Come on! You're all right.
You're still in this.
You still got it, Mr Bohannon.
You still got it.
Don't worry.
Take a breather, boy.
Take a breather.
Lend to thy neighbor in time of his need,  and pay thou thy neighbor again in due season.
Excuse me.
That's all right, that's all right.
We almost did it.
We almost did it.
Ms.
Bell? Where have you been? I looked all over for you.
I took a walk.
And then I heard all the commotion.
It's a little vulgar for a lady's taste, I'm afraid.
Ah! I'm afraid my Latin is a little undernourished.
Bread and circuses.
Huh.
You engineered this fight, as a distraction, until you could get payroll.
Just like the Romans did with unruly crowds.
Give them food and spectacle.
I think you overestimate my abilities, Lily.
I hope not, for all our sakes.
Holy mother of God, you had us worried there.
I thought, for a wee bit, we'd lost our wager.
Right, Sean? Sean? Sean? Shall I walk you back to the car? I have Robert's maps.
And, yes.
He found the route.
To the Rockies? And beyond.
And you've had them all this time? I have.
I knew it! I knew it! Oh, I could strangle you and embrace you at the same time.
- Where are they? - They're in a safe place.
Ah! How much? What Robert is owed.
All right.
Let's go.
Let's go.
All right.
That's right.
That's right.
You gonna do this.
All right? Time! Now, boy.
Now! Here you go.
You got it.
You got it.
One more time.
Get in there.
Come on, Bohannon! Get up! Get your hands up.
Get your hands up.
Hit him! Come on, man.
Come on! Come on, Bohannon.
That's right.
Get in there.
It's over! It's over! Why are you so glib? We just lost everything.
I bet it all on the darkie.
We're rich, Brother.
What'd you use? The liniment? Mmm? It was a little pepper powder to the eyes, was it? Are you trying to get us both killed? And Mr Bohannon being our only friend and all.
This is my only friend.
Are you all right? Never better.
Good.
:: Did you enjoy the fight? - Very much.
Good.
Thank you for the water.
Ah.
Next.
Gregory Toole, walking boss for cut crew three.
And to be completely honest with you, Mr Bohannon, we thought you had more in you.
Mmm.
Life does have its surprises, don't it, Mr Toole? Next.
Elam Ferguson.
Walking boss, freedmen cut crew.
You've done it, my son.
The sacrifice is over.
Father.
I was blessed.
I had a vision.
I've seen the great steel beast.
Its breath was smoke.
It shook the ground.
I killed it.
Make sure that's tight.
Closer.
Closer to the platform.
Musicians, come on, over here, over here.
Thank you.
What are you going to play? - Dixie.
:: not Dixie, you idiot.
Battle Hymn of the Republic, do you know it? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, fine.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Photographer, over here, please, on the platform with me and be at the ready.
Now, on my signal, be ready to play, loudly.
She takes my arm even though she stabs me in the back.
Have you given my proposal any further consideration? You mean the money you're squeezing out of me for Robert's maps? I'm only asking for what is fair, Thomas.
Extortion doesn't become a lady.
I will not fall prey to it.
Excuse me.
Play, play, play, play, play.
Ah, Jordan.
Welcome, welcome.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is an honor for me to introduce a true friend of the railroad who has come here with the full backing of the United States Senate, to meet with the Indians, to thwart their opposition to our cause.
From the great state of Illinois, Senator Jordan Crane.
On behalf of my fellow committee members, I thank you for that warm reception.
But down to business.
As Mr Durant said, I am here, laurel branch in hand, to meet with the Indians.
But, in the other hand, I wield a cudgel, and that cudgel is the full and mighty force of the United States military.
If these savages want a scrap, then by God, we'll give them one they won't soon disremember.
Well done.
Well done.
First, the fuzzies, and now they're letting the Injuns come for a party.
I tell you, lads, we'll soon be working for the likes of them.
- It's a sad state of affairs.
I'll drink to that.
Reverend, you ain't in here for a drink, are you? No, a spirit of a different sort now possesses me.
I come here, Mr Bohannon, hat in hand.
I wish to hell you would stop trying to save me, Preacher.
Oh, don't worry, son, I'm learning my limitations Uh-huh.
but the Lord believes one good turn deserves another.
And since I provided asylum for you, I've come here to ask for your help.
What kind of help could I possibly provide you? Well, a band of Cheyenne is coming to talk peace with the senator and Mr Durant.
Yeah.
I heard.
Whose crazy-ass idea was that? I beg your pardon, Preacher, but somehow, I don't see that ending well.
I want you to talk to your walking bosses, you tell them to keep their men in check because if you don't, we're gonna have bloodshed on our hands.
I'll do what I can.
Do I have your word? A toast in honor of the fair-haired maiden of the West.
Your spirit is a testament to all.
Thank you, Senator.
You must be anxious to return to society.
I am, but first I must tend to some unfinished business.
Well, speaking of which, you won't mind if Mr Durant and I discuss some business of our own? Not at all, Senator, please.
So, Doc, I hear there was some delay with your payroll.
Why the money problems? Oh.
A miscommunication between the bank and Pinkerton's.
No, no, no, no, the payroll was delivered and made.
Well, then the credit issue with the banks must also be resolved? Credit issue? Well, I don't know the particulars, but word is credit was no longer being extended to the Union Pacific.
Senator, if our credit line wasn't open, we wouldn't be able to operate.
Mmm-hmm.
What about the route to the Rockies? The Rockies.
What of it? Thomas has been trying to explain it to me.
I think I finally managed to grasp it.
That the route my husband mapped through the Rockies holds the key to Thomas choosing the right path to make his 40 miles here.
Is that right, Doc? - Well, I wouldn't go - Do you have these maps? No.
Well Well, that is unfortunate.
No 40 miles by May 16, no government subsidies.
You have heard that the Central Pacific have made their 40, haven't you? No.
Oh, yes.
It seems these Chinamen are quite the busy worker bees.
Then she say,  With one of these, I can get whatever I want.
Yeah, I need a word with Mr Ferguson.
If that's all right? I'll talk to him.
You ain't gotta worry about us messing with no Injuns.
Ain't no red man ever bloodied my back.
I got your word, then? Good.
We don't need no more fighting, do we? I see how you feel that way, after that ass-whooping I put on you.
I got news for you, son, I know you cheated.
- What the hell are you talking about? - You know damn well what I'm talking about.
Pepper juice on them hand wraps you was wearing, I tasted it.
I got to hand it to you, though, that was pretty slick.
You need to hand that to somebody else.
I don't know nothing about no pepper juice.
Huh.
Somebody sure as hell cheated.
If you want a re-match, you know where to find me.
Yeah.
How did your mother die? Consumption.
She's with God now.
Yes, she is.
My mother died when I was just a boy.
I remember her taking me to the creek to wash in the mornings.
She'd pretend to drop me and then grab me fast.
No matter how many times she did it, it would always make me laugh.
She's with God now, too.
Was your mother a Christian? No.
Then how can she be with God? I'm sorry your father left you and your mother alone.
My father did not leave us.
He was called away on his great Christian mission.
He's a servant of God, and was called to help the inferiors, like Negroes.
And the Indians? Would you like to hold it for me, or do you have some information? Mr Durant has taken private funds from the railroad for his personnel use.
How much, and for what? $147,000.
He is speculating on the railroad stock.
Money is not necessary this time.
Oh.
I would like information instead.
What do you mean? There is a man named Harper, a former Union soldier, Sergeant Frank Harper, I believe.
He used to work for us.
He ran off.
I'd like to know where he is.
How am I supposed to find him? I heard Sergeant Harper hails from your home state of Illinois.
Matter of fact, he still has family that reside in the city of Chicago.
Frank Harper.
Well, I'll have my people Yes, you will.
Set it out somewhere here.
There you go, men.
Keep it moving there, lads.
What's wrong, man? Clear! Down! I'll be damned.
Come on now, up and out of there, boys.
It's our turn for collecting some scalps.
Y'all Negroes get back in that cut.
We ain't got no fight with them Injuns.
Y'all heard the man.
Well, well.
What's the matter, boyo? You niggers afraid the nappy fuzz will be sliced off the top of your pates, are you? We ain't got no dog in this fight.
You on your own.
We got business, you and me, and I'll see it done, so I will.
Why are we stopped? - We ain't.
:: Toole, Get your men back in that cut!We got a road to build.
I want y'all sons of bitches working, all of you.
I don't take orders from any man walloped by a nigger.
You're fired.
Get off my cut.
I'll fix your flint for this, Bohannon.
You have my word on that.
Oh, yeah? Get off my cut.
Come on, lads, let's go.
The hell with it.
Get the hell out of me way.
All right, there's work to get done.
Y'all forget about them Injuns, and you give me the full chisel, assholes and elbows, or I'll fire the lot of you.
You seem to have an answer for everything, Thomas.
I always do.
But why should I believe you? Well, why wouldn't you, Jordan? It's the truth.
We've worked together long enough for you to give me a little more credit than that.
Is there a point you're trying to make, Jordan? To the point.
I'm well aware of your schemes, and to put it plain, they don't concern me, except when they concern me.
Jordan, why are you really here? I'm here to tell you that filching Union Pacific Railroad funds for personal speculating concerns me greatly.
Another unfounded rumor created by my rivals.
$147,000.00
How's that for an unfounded rumor? People say you've lost a lot of money in the market, Doc.
Is it really so bad that it's come to this? I have nothing more to say about this.
# I am here # Right here # Where God puts none asunder # And you # Black dress, black shoes # You do # Invite me under # Go on # Go there # You can # See me aging # The stars turn # Balls burn # Come for more scalps, have you? Welcome to our town.
Don't be afraid.
You're among friends.
I am Reverend Cole.
These are my children, Joseph and Ruth.
We are pleased you have come here in the name of peace and fellowship.
Are you the daughter he abandoned? Maybe peace and fellowship are more important to him than his own family.
This, Senator Crane, he's from the United States government.
Do you understand? I speak your language.
Well, good.
Senator Crane has come here to offer your people a better way of life.
Better than what? Better than what you have.
I like what I have.
I understand that.
But your people live in the Stone Age.
We live at the beginning of a great industrial revolution.
- He doesn't understand why Chief, Chief, Chief.
The United States government is offering you a piece of land of your own.
:: we have our own land.
No, it's not yours.
It's the US government's.
:: Did they buy it? - No.
- Did they trade for it? - It's not like that.
We Then how can they own it? He has a point.
If you accept our offer, you won't have to hunt buffalo anymore or roam the prairie.
You can depend on your country to take care of you.
You are not my country.
We will give you everything you need, if you will just submit to living on a reservation.
We need nothing from you.
- Mr Durant, if we could just - I'm done, Reverend! Good luck.
# God in three persons, Blessed trinity # Jesus Christ? She asked who Jesus Christ is.
I told her Jesus Christ is our savior, born of a virgin.
What did she say, Joseph? She said she would like to hear Mary explain the virgin birth to her husband.
Mr Bohannon.
Ma'am.
What are you doing here? Well, I guess I made a stupid promise to somebody.
I figured the last thing you'd want to see is an Indian.
Well, these are peaceful Indians.
They're Joseph's people.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, you're right, go ahead.
No, it's not the Indians I'm worried about.
You'll be happy to know I've taken your advice.
I'm making arrangements for passage back East.
Best place for you.
Right.
Well, if you'd excuse What's wrong? Mrs Bell? Where did you get that? That's mine! Not yours.
:: Stop.
It's all right.
- Take your hands off me! Go! Calm down! Take That's your husband's hat, wasn't it? Wasn't it? What happened, Mr Bohannon? You.
You lied to me.
It was your people.
Where are you headed? I'm going to tell Mr Durant that they're here, the ones that committed the massacre, the ones who murdered my husband.
:: are you Sure you want to do that? - Yes, of course I am.
Why wouldn't I? 'Cause it will lead to more killing, not just the braves, but the women and children, too.
What is your stake in this, Mr Bohannon? Lady, I ain't got one.
Then why do you care? Mrs Bell, there is a price attached to everything.
You think you can afford the cost of this, then you go on.
You must think of your women and children.
I am thinking of them.
How can I ask them to give up what they have for this? I have never seen such a dark, filthy place.
If you walk away from here without a deal, you are asking for war.
No.
You ask for war.
Listen to reason.
Your people will be slaughtered.
As will yours.
Gentlemen! We're here to find a way to peace, not war.
Be warned.
We Cheyenne are plenty, and my braves are hungry for a good fight.
Enough, Jordan, enough of your pissing in the wind.
They only understand one thing, strength.
Now, let me give it to you plain and simple, Chief.
This train means the end of life as you know it.
My son had a vision.
He will defeat your train.
Wait.
Chief, perhaps your son would like a chance to see his vision come true? Hmm? Hello, ladies.
What is this all about? It seems an Injun's gonna race the train back to town.
I guess you changed your mind.
For the moment.
Stoke that fire.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on! Come on! Ha! Well, I think the chief got my message loud and clear.
- Don't you? - Well done, Doc.
But there's still the matter of $147,000.
One word from me and hordes of investigators will be crawling through your books.
- You're bluffing.
:: What makes you think so? Because If I fall, you fall with me.
Hmm.
Not so, Doc.
Not so.
I sold all my landholdings in Nebraska, and I've divested myself of my Crédit Mobilier stock, all at a nice profit, I might add.
You have nothing over me anymore.
You once had my head in a vice, Thomas.
Now, I have your pecker in my pocket.
I'll be leaving for Chicago tonight and will report this as soon as I arrive.
You'll be trading in your fancy duds for prison pinstripes.
You're finished, Durant.
All this, gone.
Jordan, please.
She wants you to take this.
And she wanted you to know she, too, has lost her husband.
He was killed in a fight with one of his own arrows.
The other braves, they brought her this hat.
Tell her thank you.
:: we will not return.
:: Chief, I beg you to reconsider.
Son, these people are not good.
If you stay here, you will die.
Come back with me.
Please.
Come home with your father.
I can't, Father.
I can't.
Is the chief your father? Why did you leave him? So I could help the inferiors.
# Believe me if all those endearing young charms # Which I gaze on so fondly today # Were to change by tomorrow and fleet in my arms # Like fairy gifts fading away # Though would'st still be adored # As this moment thou art # Let thy loveliness fade as it will # And around the dear ruin Each wish of my heart # Would entwine itself verdantly still # You were right.
Sit down.
Robert needed you as much as you needed him.
My husband died for his dream.
Now it's up to you to bring it to life.
The blasted red devils are just up on the hill.
I say we go get 'em now, bring back their bloody heads on pikes.
Now where else might y'all be headed? Out of the way, Bohannon.
We aim to go after the Injuns, and there's nothing you can do about it.
The hell there ain't.
You're outnumbered.
You can't kill us all, lad.
I can kill about five of you.
You hear that? He's not even fully loaded.
Only five bullets he's got.
I got six bullets.
I was just gonna shoot you twice.
:: Trouble? Yeah.
There's still only two of you.
I'd count again if I were you.
You see, it is important to Mr Thomas Durant that the Injuns are not harmed.
I'm sure you boys can find some amusement here in town.
Let's go, boys.
Careful now.
We want Eva.
The one the Injuns marked up.
Well, you have to poke another, she ain't here.
Where is the heathen bitch? I don't know.
I ain't seen her since the train race.
I know where to find her.
You know what people think.
Two peas in a pod, huh? I say we go get him now.
This is the one.
Get dressed.
We didn't do nothing! Let him go! We was just talking.
Leave her alone.
No.
Get moving.
Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands,  as is fitting in the Lord.
Husbands, love your wives  and do not be harsh with them.
Children, obey your parents in everything,  for this pleases the Lord.
Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything,  not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favor,  but with sin  Sincerity.
sincerity of the heart and reverence of the Lord.
Well, I don't believe it.
How old are you, boy? I ain't but nine years, sir.
Pay up, gentlemen.
It's dangerous, you know, teaching them to read.
- That's true.
Nat Turner was taught to read.
:: Nonsense.
Let me show you.
Boy, can you explain to me the meaning of what you just read? No, master.
See? It's like a parrot reciting Shakespeare.
Well done, Elam.
Well done.
Now I have heard the groaning of the Israelites,  whom the Egyptians hold in slavery,  and I have remembered my promise.
Say unto the children of Israel,  I am the Lord.
And I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians,  and I will rid you out from under their bondage,  and I will redeem you with a stretched-out arm,  and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
Behold Robert Bell's legacy, gentlemen.
We follow the North Platte clear into Wyoming, and we skirt the Black Hills to the south, and strike the Rockies here.
He found the way through.
Now, we have payroll, we have manpower, we have material.
I expect no further delays in making the 40 miles by the government deadline.
:: Am I understood? - Yes, sir.
:: Yes, sir, Mr Durant.
:: Good.
And we will finish on schedule? We won't finish anything if I don't dig myself out of this hole we're in.
:: How long will you be gone, sir? - a few days.
I'm escorting Mrs Bell to Chicago.
Oh! You can wipe that lascivious look off your face.
It's not what you think.
I'm seeing Senator Crane.
But I have seen how she look at you.
:: Nonsense.
- No, it's true.
Hmm.
I guess you're leaving.
I'm going to Chicago, to see my late husband's family.
Then it's on to England.
You don't sound too excited about going home.
I don't have a home anymore.
I had hoped to stay here, with Robert, forever, settle down on a ranch or a farm, raise a family, grow old and die together.
The world don't care much for our plans, Mrs Bell.
Indeed it don't, Mr Bohannon.
Do try and stay out of trouble.
I'll try, ma'am.
Mr Bohannon! Mr Bohannon! Mr Bohannon! You've got to stop them.
- What the hell happened? - Elam, they're gonna hang him.
- How the hell is that my problem? - You've gotta do something.
Talk to the Swede.
He's the head of security.
He's the one gave them the go ahead.
Said his men are gonna let off some steam.
Move them tables aside! Move that table! Clear out! Anybody squeamish about a hanging had best move along right now! Let him loose! Let him loose or there's going to be a river of Mick blood flowing in here! There'll be an ocean of nigger blood.
I guarantee that.
Boys.
Looks like you've brung shovels to a gunfight.
Well, no matter.
We'll use them to dig your graves.
We'll take our chances.
Put them weapons down.
This here's between them and me.
Ain't no use in none of y'all getting shot dead for it.
I can't do that.
- We can't just walk away.
- You've got to walk away, else the rest of y'all gonna get killed, too.
I say we finish him now.
Mr Toole.
Mr Toole.
Give me your word they ain't gonna come to no harm if they walk away.
You have my word.
Tell your men to put their guns down.
Lower your guns, boys.
Go on now.
:: Elam.
:: you all git.
Go on! You hear me? Get out of here.
Go on.
Tuck your tails! Ain't nothing we can do.
I don't know whether you're aware of it, but we Irish are the niggers of the British Empire.
That's what this is about? You showing the world you ain't at the bottom of the barrel no more? You're damn right it is.
Any last words? I'm gonna kill your lily white ass.
When we meet in hell, perhaps.
Go on, now! Go to it, boys! Drop him.
Shoot him! Will somebody please shoot the bastard? Well, you shoot him.
Cut his ties.
Let's go! Got a horse outside waiting for you.
Any of y'all thinking about coming after me best get fitted for a shroud and a box.
Just climb on the sumbitch and hang on.
Sure is a stupid-looking spud muncher, ain't he? Some respect for the dead, Mr Bolan.
In the end, when all is said and done, all we really own is our death.
It is given us the moment we is born, and we carry that burden the best we can.
I've seen men die screaming.
I've seen men die with nary a peep.
Well, this one here died trying to draw down on Cullen Bohannon.
Well, then, perhaps he was stupid after all.
Now, this hanging of yours went not so well.
He was as good as dead till Johnny Reb came busting in here.
What do you propose to do about it? What do you mean? Well, this brigand, this rebel has upset the balance once again.
And he must be dealt with.
I still don't follow.
Why does that not surprise me? You must pursue Bohannon.
Hmm? - Me? - Yeah.
I don't know nothing about warfare and such.
You created this mess, and you'll clean it up or die trying.
I'll not do it.
Jesus! Now, all of you that was involved in this hanging will accompany Mr Toole on his noble quest.
How the hell do you expect these bogtrotters to track down Bohannon? Well, that's their problem.
Let me and Dix take them.
Hmm? I'll track him down like a rabid dog.
Hold.
Slow up, slow up, slow up.
:: Why we stopping here? - Good a place as any.
Bohannon.
- What you did for me back at that saloon - What the hell was you thinking? You carrying on with a white woman? - I'm a free man.
- You ain't that free.
- Why you get to decide that? - I ain't decide nothing.
That's the way of the world.
What's it like to own somebody, Mr Cullen? Any different than owning a dog or a pig or a plough? I treated my people well, if that's what you're asking.
Your people? You make it sound like they was family to you.
Well, one of them practically raised me after my mother died.
Yeah, but You be owning her.
Even if she changed your dirty drawers, you still be owning her.
I wouldn't mind owning me a white woman.
Yes, sir.
That might be nice.
Maybe I'd bring her in from the fields of an evening and have me some fun.
Watch yourself.
And what if she give me a baby boy? Would I own that, too? Or would half of him be free? And what if I bring that boy into my house from time to time and teach him to read and write? And I give that boy just enough hope to think that maybe, just maybe, he different.
Different than all the other white folk I own.
Nah.
He ain't no different.
He just a mule.
Everybody know a mule ain't no horse.
Ain't that right, Mr Cullen? Damn it all.
Damn it all.
- I'm sorry, I - No! Ma'am, please, stay.
You weren't at dinner.
I supped on brandy.
Five course meal.
Do you know what this is? - It's a penny.
:: I wish it were just a penny, rather than the seed of my own destruction.
I don't understand.
I was raised in a shanty town, in Hell's Kitchen.
Only difference between us and the rats were the rats were better fed and cleaner.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I don't want your sympathy.
One day, while I was rummaging through the trash for a meal, some gentlemen passed me by.
One of them told me he would give me a penny if I ate a putrid apple that even the rats had passed over.
I I will never forget that taste.
It was all I could do to keep it down.
They had a good laugh, and one of them tossed me the coin.
And on that day, my bark was set on a course that neither tempest nor Leviathan could alter.
I would have it all, and I would have it on my terms.
I know no other way, Lily.
I faced ruin many times and I always found a way out.
But this time, I fear, I may not recover.
Is this Thomas Durant or some blubbering schoolboy I see before me? I gave you those maps so you could finish the railroad.
For Robert's sake.
I won't let you quit.
Get your head out of that bottle and figure out a way.
I gave my slaves their freedom before the war started.
Damn near went broke paying their wages.
I'm supposed to thank you for that? No.
I only did it for my wife.
I sure as hell didn't understand it.
It pissed me off, tell you the truth.
So why'd you do it, then? Well, Mary had a way of talking me into things.
It wasn't until I come home from the war, right then, actually, that I understood that she was right.
I found Mary where she was hanged, you know, but I couldn't find my boy.
We'd always play hide and go seek, and he'd always hide up in the hayloft.
Every damned time, every time.
He'd And I'd just pretend like I couldn't find him.
See, the Yankees, they burned the barn, but it was still standing, and there he was, up in the hayloft.
His body was curled up, and his arms was hugging his knees to his chest.
But he wasn't alone.
Bethel, the woman who raised me, she was with him.
She had her arms wrapped around him, like she was protecting him from the flame.
Both their bodies, they were scorched black, fused together.
Couldn't really tell where one of them ended and the other one began.
And I just remember standing there and thinking to myself,  God's got a funny way of teaching you things.
Huh? Yeah.
I wouldn't give a shit if I was you, either.
:: you ever shoot a gun? - Oh, Yeah.
Massah let us shoot guns on the plantation all the time.
You try.
You got to cock it.
Again.
Keep firing.
:: Damn.
- You're ready.
What do you mean, I'm ready? I can't even hit the dang tree.
Well, you're just gonna have to get in close, then.
How am I going to get up close without getting shot? Whoever you're shooting at is going to be just as scared as you are.
You take your time.
Don't lose your head.
Count your rounds as you fire.
If you're calm, you'll count their rounds, too.
The trick is making sure the other man has to reload before you do.
And if I don't? You're dead.
End of lesson.
:: Good morning.
:: Lily: Good morning, Thomas.
I think I may have found a way out of my mess.
Now, this is a map of all the other railroads, an intricate web of iron connecting all the eastern cities.
But something is missing.
Can you see it? There is no direct route connecting the Union Pacific to New York, yet.
Well done.
Why not? Well, I have two choices.
I can build a beltline to the R&R or to the M&M line, further south.
I own substantial stock in the R&R.
I don't understand how this helps you out of your mess.
A stock tip like that could have the President himself eating out of my hand.
If I know Senator Crane, that's exactly what he's after.
I didn't know they had something planned.
I don't know them well.
I've only met them once.
I'm sure they'll be very happy to see you.
I'm not so sure.
Can't you stay a while? I have to meet with Senator Crane, but I'll be back later to take you to your hotel.
:: Lily.
:: Mrs Bell.
I am so sorry to see you under such circumstances.
Thank you, my dear.
:: Emily.
:: Lily.
Charlotte.
I see, by your dress, you're already out of mourning.
- I didn't know.
- Let's go meet the guests, shall we? Jordan, I'm afraid you have me by the short hairs.
I came here today, hat in hand, to beseech you.
Show some mercy.
I'm almost tempted to see this through and let you rot in jail.
Almost? So there's hope? There's hope.
But it's going to cost you.
Name your price, sir.
I want to know if you're connecting to the R&R or the M&M.
Prison it is then.
I shall contact the authorities now.
You'll be ruined, Doc.
Your railroad snatched from you.
It's the R&R.
:: When will you announce? - Friday.
You still have plenty of time.
Put everything you have into it.
You'll be a millionaire by the end of the week.
But don't tell a soul.
Robert brought this painting with him to London.
It was on display when I went to see him lecture.
I'm sure you're sorry you ever left the comfort of London after what you've been through.
Soon you will be returning to your old life, and your dreadful experiences out there will seem like a bad dream.
The nerve of her, showing up with that Durant.
Look at her peacocking around in that garish dress.
I'd like to give her a good drubbing.
If she hadn't been there, Robert may have been able to save himself.
He killed that savage with his dying breath so she could live.
I begged Robert not to marry the woman.
Spoiled, pampered aristocrat.
Fair-haired maiden of the West.
Indeed.
Robert didn't kill the savage, Charlotte.
I did.
You lying little brat.
:: Lily.
:: Hold your tongue, madam.
Robert did give his life saving me.
He is the reason I still draw breath, but I didn't just stand back and watch it happen.
We fought together, side by side, just as we lived.
I wouldn't expect you to understand that, Charlotte.
Robert fought hard, but the Indian prevailed.
I watched him murder my husband, and he would have killed me next.
But I tore an arrow from my shoulder and thrust it through his throat.
And I pushed.
And I didn't stop pushing until he was dead.
So that's your fair-haired maiden of the West.
Lily.
I think it's time to go.
Right here.
Yeah, they've been gone for hours.
This is madness.
We're never gonna catch them.
Shut the hell up.
We ain't done nothing wrong.
If you guys had been better at tracking, we would have found them already.
Still warm.
Ambush! Ambush! Where are they shooting from? Am I dying? Yeah.
Will I find peace where I'm bound? I don't know if men like us ever find peace, Mr Bolan, in this world or the next.
But I hope so.
I really do.
What are you smiling at? You empty.
Any last words? Go to hell, you black My name is Elam Ferguson.
You be sure to tell the devil that when he asks who killed you.
Why so glum, Jordan? The stock could always recover.
I lost everything.
- You still have your Senator's salary.
- This isn't over.
There's still the matter of the missing $147,000.
Already back in the company's till.
Some strange sort of accounting mistake.
People have already lost their jobs over it.
And just to be sure, I've applied grease to all the proper machinery.
Rumor has it, you made three million off the deal.
Five.
I managed to buy the M&M stock at quite a discount.
But don't tell a soul.
Thomas, please, I have a family.
Don't worry, Jordan.
You're still of some use to me.
Well, in the meantime, here's a shiny new penny for you.
:: are you Sure about this? - Yes.
But what will you do? Where will you live? I haven't figured it out yet.
I do know that I cannot go back to London.
I cannot go back to a life I now despise.
Then it's decided.
I knew you would understand.
Lily, there's something I must tell you.
:: Thomas - No, No, I must say this.
I am a man, and what I have with my wife is It is not what a man needs.
Ours was always a practical marriage.
I mean, there was a time when But that time has passed.
What I'm saying is if I had a woman like you by my side, then No.
If I had you by my side, Lily, there is nothing I We couldn't do together.
This isn't fair on you.
I know.
I know that.
Don't say anything.
If there is a chance, if there is the glimmer of the faintest chance, then you will make me a very happy man.
What about Toole? He out in them woods with a bullet in him.
They all dead? Yep.
Found this in one of his saddlebags.
You reckon I should say something? Suit yourself.
I don't really know my Bible verses.
Twenty-third Psalm.
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in the green pastures.
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul.
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness  for His name's sake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,  I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me.
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,  and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
Thomas.
What the hell was that? Why have we stopped? Excuse me.
Come on now.
Get in here.
Let me help you.
Thomas Durant? We gonna make them Injuns pay for derailing this train.
Right away, I want you to get back to Hell on Wheels, rouse those useless drunken cavalry men.
Yes, sir.
And get Bohannon.
I want him to go with them.
Mr Bohannon is a fugitive, sir.
A fugitive? From what? From whom? There was an incident in the saloon.
Mr Bohannon killed one of our men as we was attempting to hang a Negro.
You were hanging a Negro in the saloon? He was caught with a white woman.
:: a white woman? - Yeah.
:: you mean one of the whores? - Yes, sir.
You were going to hang a Negro for screwing a whore? It seemed appropriate.
Those freed slaves work twice as hard for half the pay.
Have they deserted us? Only the one they was hanging.
Bohannon cut him loose and they rode off.
And I sent a posse in pursuit.
You have run off the man I wish to pursue the savages.
Nice work, Mr Gundersen.
I am unarmed, please! I beg for your mercy.
No! No! No! Settle down, boy.
Hold still.
LILY: Mr Bohannon.
What on earth are you doing? Have you quite finished? Mr Bohannon! That's enough.
I need to see you back in Hell on Wheels right away.
Don't.
It's the engineer, he's badly burnt.
What kind of monster would do this? Oh, my God.
All is lost.
:: all Is lost.
- Don't say that.
I was a fool to believe that love could prevail over hate.
No.
You have to believe, now more than ever.
Pray with us, Father.
Pray? God has abandoned this terrible place.
Blood is God here.
Just as it was in Kansas and in Babylon in the old book.
As it always was and always will be.
No, Reverend, please.
They're sending soldiers to kill your people, Joseph.
I'm sorry I failed you.
My whole life My life's become a ridiculous failure.
My whole life.
Oh, Jesus.
My Jesus Christ! Yes, Jesus.
Papa? What's wrong? Ruth.
Father? Father? Father? Father? Father? - I didn't sign on to be no Indian fighter.
You didn't sign on at all.
I spared your neck from the noose because you told me that building a railroad was like fighting a war.
This is the war, Mr Bohannon.
GRIGGS: Are you telling me you want me to bring this Johnny Reb along? Yes.
GRIGGS: No.
Hell, no.
I don't take orders from you.
But you do take orders from my good friend, General Dodge.
You are aware that he worked for me before the war, aren't you? I can always send a telegram if you don't believe me.
What about him? This is Joseph Black Moon.
He is willing to lead you to his father's camp.
Now, why the hell would he do that? Joseph will negotiate with his father for the handover of the renegades who caused the derailment, for a guarantee.
No harm comes to the women and children.
What kind of soldier do you think I am? I don't know.
That's why I want your guarantee.
So, it's agreed? Agreed.
But I don't like it one damn bit.
Thank you, Joseph.
You may go.
What you asking me to do here, sir? We can't risk that hothead, Griggs, starting a war with the Cheyenne right now.
We haven't enough troops.
But I cannot allow them to continue to terrorize my railroad.
:: you want revenge? - I want justice.
Different words for the same thing.
Kill the renegades, Mr Bohannon.
What you doing back here? Lovely to see you, too.
What happened to England, huh? I got a taste of England when I went to Chicago.
Must have tasted pretty bad for you to come back here and take up with the likes of him.
I'm not taking up with him.
Lily? - If you say so.
- Lily! I am not a kept woman, if that's what you're implying.
So what, you're trading in them satin sheets for a place out here in the muck with the rest of us peons? Lily, it's time for lunch.
Yeah, I'll take that as a no.
Mr Bohannon, has anyone ever told you what an insufferable ass you are? Yeah.
All right, boys, let's get this spur finished.
Hey! That must be some fine tail if you're willing to risk your neck twice for it.
Things is different this time.
Yeah, well, look here.
Durant wants me to ride out with them Yankees and kill the Indians what derailed the train.
Them blue coats get to taking scalps, they liable to cut your rebel hair, too.
I know it.
That's why I'm asking you to ride with me.
You only asking because you still think I owe you.
No.
Our account's square.
I'm asking you because I trust you.
Right now, you're all I got.
No shit.
Walking boss need me.
All right then.
I need to visit in here first.
Don't stay too long just to impress me.
Hey! Pull up your britches and get out.
Give him his money back.
Don't you come in here running off my business.
Woman, I am your business.
:: Is that so? - Yeah, it is.
Well, give me your dang dollar and let's get to it.
- So, I gotta pay you before we start now? - Yeah, that's right.
Because I figure you'll get yourself killed before we even get started.
Uh-uh.
Toole the one that got himself killed.
Oh.
What? So, are you some kind of dangerous gunslinger now? Is that it? Maybe.
I'm fixing to be an Injun fighter, too.
Get out of my crib.
:: What? - you heard me.
I don't want no dead man's trade.
Last I saw you, you barely escaped a neck stretching, and you ride on out of here, and I figured for certain they got you killed.
Now you come back, traipsing on in here like you own the place? I thought you'd be happy to see me.
I am happy to see you, idiot.
I just said so.
Now, give me that damn dollar.
How's your father? Very weak.
You'll have to tend to him.
- Where are you going? - I'm going to help them find my brother.
Your own brother? He has to be stopped before he starts a war.
Be careful, Joseph.
Will you just look at that? An Injun, a nigger and a greyback.
We got ourselves a rainbow, boys.
Mount up.
There's no reason to panic, Lily.
I'm not, Thomas.
I'm simply moving out.
But where will you go? I still have our tent, Robert's and mine.
I'll find a spot.
Are you mad? Living amongst that rabble? And we're under threat of Indian attack.
It's too dangerous.
I won't have it.
That's not your decision to make.
Oh! I see.
I thought it significant that you chose to come back here with me, but I see I was mistaken.
I came back because I believe in you.
I believe in this railroad.
Together, we can get it done.
But not together.
I'm sorry.
Hmm.
So am I.
Taking you in, comforting you, salving the memory of Robert at every turn.
And for that, I am eternally grateful.
Please, Thomas, can we end this amiably? You played me like a fiddle, didn't you? Right under my nose, where I could see you, hear your voice, smell you every day.
I should go.
Could you have Henri help me with my things? No.
Carry them yourself.
Hold! We follow Little Bear Creek north for a day, then head west.
How many in your father's camp? Fifty, maybe 60.
Mostly women and children.
:: Where are all the braves? - Out hunting.
What about this Pawnee Killer? My father will know where he is.
He better.
Think that was smart, telling him there's only women and children at that camp? What do you mean? What if your father don't give up Pawnee Killer? Lieutenant Griggs gave me his guarantee.
So the white man gave you his word, huh? Lieutenant? - How we doing? - Fine.
Is that a Confederate sabre you got on your belt there? Yes, it is.
Where'd you get it? Antietam.
Spoils of victory.
You call Sharpsburg a victory? Antietam.
And, yeah, I do, a glorious one.
Mount up! That'll be six bits.
Six bits? Seventy-five cents, unless Unless you got something else in mind.
What are you doing? - You can put it on my account.
:: all Right, Eva.
I'll be back for it later.
You know where I'll be.
Now fly.
:: Thank You.
I'll pay you back.
:: When? I have a small purse of coins somewhere.
Yeah, don't worry about it for now.
First thing I'd do is get you a carpenter to lay you some floor boards.
Otherwise, you'll be saying hello to Mr Trench Foot.
I'm well acquainted with trench foot.
I have spent a year in the wilderness.
I reckon you're a good sight tougher than you look, ain't you, Mrs Bell? - Please.
Lily.
:: all Right then, Lily.
I'd still suggest you putting in them floor boards, though.
Course, I had to throw my leg over that cross-eyed carpenter twice before he got mine right.
Tell us about your glorious victory at Sharpsburg, Lieutenant.
Antietam it is, then.
I was with the 51 st Pennsylvania.
Me and my boys took the Burnside bridge.
We softened them Rebs up with a light howitzer from the east bank.
Then we stormed that bridge like hounds from hell.
Should have seen them greybacks run.
Yes, sir.
Them boys got the skinny end of the horn that day.
I was on the other side of the bridge that day.
Is that so? Yep.
You want to know why we retreated? We was out of ammunition from killing Yankees.
Now, don't get me wrong, they were some brave men.
Brave men.
General McClellan might just as well have been sending them up against a firing squad.
They kept charging, we kept shooting, like fish in a bloody barrel.
Time we was done, there was a bridge of bodies across that river.
Yeah.
That must have been when you finally come across.
When all the killing was done.
Yeah.
We must've put down 500 Yankees that day.
So You want to call that a glorious victory, you go ahead.
Five hundred, it doesn't matter.
Hey.
Hey! We won.
And you lost.
And I got the sword right here to prove it.
Yeah.
Well, I guess I'm just gonna have to take it off you - And shove it up your ass, then.
:: Yeah, Is that so? Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Sometimes you gotta bite your tongue and just take it.
Jesus.
Get up! Hey, hey, get up! Jensen! Jensen! Jensen! Sweet Jesus.
:: they took the horses.
:: What? Damn it to hell.
That damned father of yours is pretty clever, I'll give him that much.
My father had nothing to do with this.
It was my brother.
:: your brother? - this Is his work.
What we saw out there, too.
This bloody renegade is your brother, and you expect me to act fairly with your father? Hey! We got more important problems.
:: as in we got No horses.
- Yeah, I'm aware of that.
We need to turn around and go back.
The plan's unchanged.
We march into the village.
March? Are you crazy or just stupid? You are welcome to retreat, Mr Bohannon.
We don't need you.
Let's move out.
Off the reel, gentlemen.
We need to go back.
Following this guy's gonna be suicide.
No.
We split up, we'll be easier targets.
It's what my brother wants.
Hey.
Hey! I need to know where you stand right now.
How you mean? Pawnee Killer's fighting a rear guard action, trying to buy some time for his village, which means they ain't left yet.
What if we get there and them Injuns still here? Griggs ain't gonna be in no talking mood, that's for sure.
Well, I sure as hell ain't gonna kill no women and no children.
You just be ready.
We might end up fighting them blue coats instead of the Cheyenne.
Father? I brought you some soup.
Mother told me this was always your one true love.
I was only little, but I remember the screaming at night.
I remember the bruises on her face in the morning.
After you left, she was always afraid you'd come back, but never stopped praying you would.
She never stopped loving you.
Have you nothing to say? Leave me alone.
No.
You're the one who leaves, remember? Here, let me.
Here, drink it.
I am not my mother.
I'm not afraid of you.
What the hell are you up to, son? - What do you mean? - It's just a different bend in the same river.
Skirted it twice now, back out, back in.
Pawnee Killer would have had time to tell your father about the derailment by now.
You're just buying time for your village to escape, ain't you? What do you care? You gonna get the rest of us killed out here, leading us in circles.
That's a risk I'm willing to take.
So you never intended to go after Pawnee Killer, did you? That's not true.
I just wanted to make sure my family was safe first.
Hey! Why the hell you dragging ass? We need to stick together.
Hold your fire.
Hold your fire! You're just wasting ammunition.
- Why ain't they attacking us? - They will.
Sooner or later.
This is my favorite day of the week, other than Monday, when I give my patooty a rest.
Hey, don't be shy, Deuce.
Hello.
Oh! The ladies call me Deuce because I got two of them.
Thank you, Deuce.
Hello.
Everybody stares at my tattoos, but nobody asks.
And, yeah, it don't wipe off.
Yes, I heard you were captured by Indians.
Yavapai.
Came upon us from the grass.
It was a sunny day.
They hacked up my mom and dad, scalped them.
Raped my little sister and smashed her brains out with rocks.
You gonna eat that? No, please.
But I was lucky.
I had the pox.
They wouldn't touch me, traded me off to some Mojave.
They was a cake walk compared to what the Yavapai would have been.
I have these terrible nightmares about the Indian I killed.
It's because his spirit's wandering.
- It's reaching out to you.
:: Yes.
Yes, and in the dream, he His cold hands clutch at my ankles.
Don't let him get you.
He's trying to drag you onto the path to the dead world.
:: it seems So real When it happens.
:: it Is real.
When a woman kills a brave, it invites big magic.
Especially a white woman.
If the Indians don't attack us tonight, I want to start work again tomorrow.
Mr Durant, Bohannon is a killer.
I can prove it.
Yeah? Look at these papers I found in his tent.
Right now, Mr Bohannon is hunting the Indians who attacked us.
:: your job Is to Get the men back to work.
:: Yeah, Yeah.
In Washington.
In Washington, he killed.
Now, Johnson knew he killed, so he killed Johnson.
:: Mr Gundersen.
:: Mmm? we will post a relay of sentries Out to the cut.
Arm everyone.
:: the work must continue.
:: No.
He is not done killing.
Now look at this.
He's looking for others among us.
Look at these names.
Listen to me.
Half the men out there are killers.
Half of them are accomplices.
They are all afraid of Bohannon.
He is an agent of progress, an asset to me in this endeavor.
Whatever his motivations.
Now you will feed this fantasy of revenge into the stove.
Tomorrow, God willing, we will resume work on my railroad.
Yeah.
Mr Durant.
It's a long walk through Indian territory to Sweden, Mr Gundersen.
Sweden? I am from Norway.
I am Norwegian.

:: Looks like we just missed them, sir.
:: you son of a bitch.
You knew this was gonna happen.
You planned this with your brother, didn't you? SOLDIER: Lieutenant! He's just a kid.
No!.

As I remember, Robert warned you about laying track here because this area was prone to washouts.
Robert was right.
I was wrong.
Is that what you need to hear? Well, I've said it.
Now, this section needs to be re-surveyed and re-built.
Can you do it? Yes.
But it'll have to be re-routed south as Robert intended.
Do you see this ridge? This is solid bedrock.
Yes, but that'll take longer.
You'll have to have your men work faster, Doc.
You get paid to build 40 miles of useable road.
If you build here again, it will get washed out again.
:: Well, it may not rain again for months Or - Those are my terms.
Of course, you could always find another surveyor Somewhere.
Excuse me.
GRIGGS: Black Moon, you're gonna answer for this, you know that.
I should have let my brother kill you.
:: you should try Right now.
Hey! We've had enough killing for one day.
I don't suppose either of you are keen on joining me? To do what? What I came for.
You'll never find them.
We'll see about that.
They know that you're following them.
They'll kill the both of you.
Yeah, we'll see about that, too.
Last chance, Bohannon.
I figured.
What about you? You don't need his permission.
He's nobody's master anymore.
Go if you're going.
Mr Bohannon, you have to finish this.
What are you talking about? This.
What you came to do.
We came to kill the bastards who derailed the train.
We got 'em.
No one's gonna believe you unless you have proof.
You mean scalps? They're just gonna have to take my word for it.
I ain't bringing back proof.
Not even for $20 a head? Seems a shame leaving all this money lying around here for the buzzards, don't you think? My brother belongs to me.
Don't look at me.
I'm a sinner, Ruth.
You know that better than anyone, don't you? - Father? - No.
You let me finish.
I've been wrasslin' with God, Ruth.
And I honestly believe that I was chosen for a great mission.
And that's why I left.
But you failed.
No, I'd like to think that my work with John Brown may have helped in some small way to free the slaves.
I didn't say John Brown failed.
I said you failed.
One drop of love That's all we needed.
One drop of love would have sustained us.
Now, Ruth, I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.
Don't you walk away from me! Praise his name, sister.
Praise his name.
Praise! The McGinnes Brothers Magic Lantern Show.
Back in business! You know what we forgot, Seano? We forgot to get a new sign.
There's no more drama, comedy, history, is there? As usual, Brother, I am three steps ahead of you.
Painter's due in an hour.
:: have the new sign by nightfall.
Nell! Nell! A word! Now that is a fine door-ful of a woman.
Nell, you know we have an agreement.
Nobody's working, Swede.
When nobody works, nobody gets paid.
If nobody gets paid, then nobody comes to see my Son of a bitch.
Now, we have an agreement.
There's a better way, Brother.
Straight and steady, please, sir.
Yes, ma'am.
Mrs Bell, somebody's coming.
Mrs Bell.
Mr Bohannon.
:: What you doing Out here? - Surveying.
I'm helping Durant complete his 40 miles.
We killed the dog soldiers that murdered your husband.
I thought you should know.
So Robert's death has been avenged.
I'd hoped it would close the hole I feel in my heart.
Ain't nothing gonna close that, ma'am.
:: Very impressive, Mr - Ferguson.
Elam Ferguson.
I suppose Mr Bohannon sent you to collect the bounty.
Bohannon ain't take them scalps.
I did.
Well I guess I owe you some money, then.
Uh Ten dollars a scalp, if I remember correctly.
Twenty.
And if you don't mind, I prefer them gold eagles to paper.
Would you like a drink? I ain't too much of a drinking man.
Well, a cigar, perhaps? Thank you.
Well, please sit.
You strike me as a capable man.
I know which end is up.
Well, that is good to know.
Because I am always on the lookout for a man willing to get his hands dirty from time to time.
A man who's willing to do things off the books, as it were.
Mmm.
I'm looking for a man who wants to be feared and respected.
A man trying to improve his station in life.
Oh, you slay me, honey.
You really do.
How's about you stay home tonight? Whatcha mean? I means, why not take a night off? Maybe take more than a night off.
Are you saying I want you to be mine.
None other.
Ferguson, you in there? Elam Ferguson, come on out here.
:: You.
You son of a bitch.
:: Mercy.
On the immaculate heart of the sweet virgin herself, I pray for mercy.
And I beg you to hear me out.
You shot me straight in me gob, Mr Ferguson.
A shot that would have sent any man to his grave.
But praise the mother's son, at the last second an angel reached out and she flicked the bullet out of me neck.
I tell you true.
It's the reason I kneel before you now.
Let me show you.
Let me show you the hole.
Please, Mr Ferguson.
Bear witness to a miracle.
As I wandered in the wilderness, like our Lord himself, I came face to face with me ignorance and cruelty towards you.
And I swore to God almighty that if I survived, I would come to you on bended knee and beg for your forgiveness.
Not me.
Her.
Come on out here.
Tell her you're sorry.
I'm sorry, lass.
Sorry as the sorriest sinner.
I should not have harmed you such.
All right, then.
Go on and git.
Black Moon.
Come down.
It's your father.
Father, you're safe.
I come looking for Pawnee Killer.
Instead, I find a burial.
Have you nothing to tell me? I came to do it myself.
Go.
Climb up.
Let's complete this ceremony.
Step right this way, lads, and get an eyeful.
See the loveliest creatures from the bluest streets of Paris, français.
:: see soiled doves bare all.
:: you been gone.
Took the train to Chicago.
Whew, what a town.
Jeez.
Looks like you brought a bit of Chicago back with you.
Indeed.
Do you want to take a peek? On the house, of course.
Anything for Mr Bohannon.
Nah.
Thanks.
Hold on.
Sean would like a word with you.
Looks like you been doing some business, huh? Aye, we're packing 'em in like sardines.
How'd you pay for the extra slides? You win money in a fight or something? Yeah.
Course, the The Swede will want his pound of flesh.
:: He takes a cut? - And then some.
What you want me to do about it, Sean? Here's the thing.
We're not the only ones being preyed upon.
All the merchants of Hell on Wheels are paying him off.
So? So We took up a collection.
Everybody pitched in.
There's $100 in here For you.
What the hell for? For killing The Swede.
I ain't no gun for hire.
All right, I tell you what.
I happen to know The Swede's been stealing from Durant.
Dig you up some dirt on him, and Durant will ride him out of town on a rail.
For free.
Ask me to sit down.
Go on, ask me.
Have a seat.
Now, pour me a drink.
Another glass.
Your health.
Tastes like shit.
You ain't much of a drinking man, is you? Gave it up.
Why is that? Last time I got drunk, I got into something bad.
Listen, I need to ask you something.
You know that bidness we had to attend to? You good with that? I'm better than good.
Bout time I be the one who gets to do the hurting.
Besides, seem Mr Durant done took a liking to my work.
He say he might just call on me when need be.
Durant? Better watch yourself.
That's a slick slope you're heading down.
Hmm.
Slick with blood.
Somebody else's, for a change.
For somebody who don't drink, you're putting that down pretty good.
Ladies and gentlemen, take your glasses in hand for a toast to the great Indian killers who have made our home a safe place to work and drink! Shut up! Listen up.
I want y'all to get a good night's sleep.
Tomorrow, we hit that 40-mile marker, and I'm gonna work y'all like mongrel dogs.
It's gonna get built, gentlemen.
And we're just the bastards to build it.
Senator.
I'm glad you are here to witness such a momentous feat.
No, you're not.
You're only interested in our quid pro quo.
If you insist.
I had the Pinkertons track down the Illinois man you were looking for.
Whereabouts of Sergeant Frank Harper.
Seems he's holed up at a trading post near Council Bluffs.
Your brother was the runt of the litter.
Smaller than all the other boys.
They picked on him and teased him.
He was always in a fight, but he never backed down.
It made him strong.
It made him a great warrior.
But not a great man.
He never learned, as you did, that sometimes it's better not to fight, and other times, you must fight the ones you love.
When I saw what you were wearing, when I saw what you had prepared for your brother, I hoped that you would return to me.
But now, I see in your eyes you are becoming your own man.
And so today, I mourn for one son, Pawnee Killer.
And I mourn the loss of my other son, Black Moon, which hurts me so much more.
That's it, boys, almost there! This is it right here! This is your marker! We're gonna make it.
Now put your backs into it.
Pick it up, boys! I want them next two rails laid in the next five minutes.
Pick up the pace.
We run out of flanges again, I'll skin the runner alive! MICKEY: Hold the spike, would you.
Hold the spike.
Well, jeez! Three, two, one.
That's it, boys, almost there.
Break time's over.
Back to work.
Don't bloody look at it, sink! Nail crew, just get 'em nailed in! Clean-up crew, finish it.
That's it.
Back into it.
Almost there! You embarrass me now, boys, and I'll skin the lot of ya.
Let's go! Hold! Down.
Last one, boys! Last one.
Mr Bohannon! May I? Hmm.
Congratulations.
Congratulations, lieutenant governor.
Congratulations.
Ruth? I'm sorry.
You were waiting for me? Every night.
Joseph, are you hurt? No.
I killed him, Ruth.
I killed my own brother.
Thanks.
Excuse me, sir? Yeah? Oh.
Pardon me, ma'am.
What will you be having? Well, champagne, perhaps? What? Um How about a glass of sherry? - I love a good sherry.
Ah! Brandy.
LILY: Fine.
Brandy would be fine.
It's on me.
May I? By all means.
Thank you.
Not good? I've had better.
Yeah.
Well, you did it, 40 miles.
You said you would, and you did.
First time in my life.
Failed as a tobacco farmer, lost a war, now I'm a railroad man.
Maybe third time's the charm, huh? Maybe.
That first night we met, you told me I had no idea who you was or what you was capable of, and you was right.
I thought you were some spoiled limey brat.
Yeah, I guess I got you wrong, huh? Well, what do you think of me now, Mr Bohannon? Mrs Bell! Mr Bohannon! Doing a little celebrating? Well, you both deserve it.
What you did today was historic.
Thank you, Thomas.
Will you join us? I would love to, but there are a few issues outstanding that I need to discuss with my foreman.
Excuse me.
Black Moon.
You in here? Black Moon? You made me a pledge.
You told me you would win this war called the Union Pacific.
Today, you won a major battle.
You're a man of your word.
Thank you, sir.
I wanted to both congratulate you and offer you a bonus.
Oh! I don't need any more money, sir.
It's not that kind of bonus, Mr Bohannon.
It's much more valuable than money.
Information.
You You're Lieutenant Griggs, from the cavalry.
:: I heard about You.
:: Yeah? Well, I heard Black Moon was living in here.
You feel that Joseph led you astray? He needs to be made accountable.
You know, The Swede has been, shall we say, focused on you for some time.
:: like a hound got the scent.
:: Mmm.
He just sent a wire to the federal marshals in Washington, D.
C.
Claims he has evidence linking you to several murders back east.
You a family man, Lieutenant? Do you have a wife and children? I mean, what if someone killed your son and scalped your daughter and raped your wife? Would you stand idly by? They'll be coming to arrest you.
You telling me all this 'cause you want me to run, Mr Durant? I'm giving you a chance to save yourself, Bohannon.
I don't know, could you Could you find it in your heart to forgive him? Is he here? Not now.
Sure, I'll forgive him.
Right after I kill him.
We're We're all held accountable, you know, one way or another.
Mary! I asked you here today to acknowledge the exceptional work you've done.
We could not have come this far without you.
Now tonight at the 40-mile celebration, we shall have the pleasure of entertaining senators, investors and sundry other dignitaries.
And since we are in such short supply of ladies of repute, you will all be invited to the dance.
Ooh.
All right.
But you will have to make yourselves presentable and behave like the proper ladies I know you can pretend to be.
But I warn you, pick pockets, blushingtons, bug hunters will be severely dealt with.
Now, go clean yourselves up.
Boys? How we doing? Getting ready for the dance.
Listen.
Y'all been tailing Swede like I told you? We have.
But to no avail.
He's a slippery bastard, that one.
He rode out of town last night.
You know where he went? No.
But he bought two bottles of whiskey at the Starlight before he left.
Must be going on a bender.
Swede don't drink.
Then I guess he's meeting someone who does.
I wasn't there that night.
Check the date on my discharge.
I was wounded at Starkville two weeks before Meridian.
Then how could you know what happened that night.
I stayed in touch with Johnson and the boys after the war.
They told me all about it.
And you can still testify as to why Bohannon had motive to kill Johnson and this other man.
You think I'm crazy? He already tried to kill me once.
He'll finish the job if I go back there.
This man, he's not going to give up.
And you can keep running, but one day he just gonna show up on your doorstep and kill you dead.
Now, let's finish this thing, huh? Now.
Hey.
:: that whiskey goes in the dance tent.
:: Yes, sir.
Not in your tent.
I'm going to check 'em later, make sure they ain't light one or two bottles.
LILY: Damn it all! Right.
You having trouble with your floorboards, ma'am? Well, you're very perceptive, aren't you? I'm afraid I'm not much of a carpenter.
No, ma'am, you ain't.
Could you possibly help me? That is, if you're not busy killing anyone.
Well, sure as heck can't do any worse.
Great.
You're quite handy with a hammer and a nail.
Were you really a farmer before the war? Is that so hard to believe? Yes, actually.
I find it hard to imagine you in a domestic setting.
I couldn't either.
I always had one eye on the door.
So you were married.
Was.
Had a son, too.
War come along and jumped at the chance.
Mary didn't want me to go but She didn't stand in my way, either.
Now I'd give anything to be home and just So you lost them both? Your wife and your son.
I'm so sorry.
It's all right.
That about does it here.
Wait.
Please, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.
Please, don't Whatever happened to your wife and son, please don't let it kill the man they loved.
Sorry, Mrs Bell.
It's too late for that.
Mr Durant.
I thought you'd be well on your way by now.
Decided to stay.
Is that wise? I ain't never been accused of being wise, sir.
So we'll see you at the dance tonight? You will if I'm there.
Special ordered from New York.
Oh, Thomas.
I cannot accept this.
Oh, it's not a gift.
Think of it as payment.
For what? I've invited many potential investors to the celebration this evening.
What does that have to do with me? It's become clear to me that this railroad could do with a face, other than my own, associated with it.
You're thinking of the fair-haired maiden of the west.
Yes.
You think she'll lure the investors.
Like moths to a flame, my dear.
I'll consider it.
On one condition.
Why is nothing ever elemental with you? I want to be a part of it.
Part of what? The building of this road.
I want to see it through to the end.
Do we have a deal? Your condition is accepted, madam.
Sorry.
I don't I don't mean to disturb your prayers, preacher.
How can I help you, son? Well, I'm on a dark path, sir.
Been on it for a while now.
Where does the dark path lead? More blood.
More hatred.
I met somebody who reached out to me and asked me to turn away from the darkness.
Been wanting to preach to me, so here's your chance.
Well, there is a God.
Of that I have no doubt.
But there's a There's a devil, too.
And you know what that old devil did? You want me to tell you about that? Yeah.
Yeah? Well, that devil, he cut off God's arms.
And he hacked off God's legs.
And he gouged out his eyes, ripped out his tongue, and left him lying there in a bloody heap on the floor.
But he left God's ears so he could hear us down here when we're wailing and thrashing and praying for his help.
But, brother, there ain't a damn thing God can do to help us.
What are you saying, preacher? Just choose hate.
It's so much easier.
Brother! Choose hate.
I thought everybody was supposed to have the day off.
Everybody but us.
We had no say in it, neither.
Want me to talk to Durant about it? You shittin' in some mighty high cotton ain't you, boy? Watch yourself, Psalms.
I'm still your boss.
Who do you think you is in these fancy clothes, huh? Who cocked your hat, boy? You did.
Ain't supposed to be our boss.
You're supposed to be our leader.
Thinking you looking out for us.
Turn out you just looking out for your own damn self.
Ain't nobody else gonna do it.
I ain't your master.
You need to look you for your own self, huh? Carlton.
Cullen.
Mr Bohannon.
Been looking everywhere for you.
What's going on, Sean? I'm just making plans for The Swede.
He's just rolled back in, and he wasn't alone.
Oh, yeah? Who'she with? Well, I didn't hear any names.
But he had a on a Union jacket with sergeant stripes.
Sergeant's jacket, huh? Yeah, I think so.
Look, I know we've had our difference You sure you saw sergeant stripes? Yes! Where they at? Where they at? Where they at? Swede's caboose.
Will this make us even for the fight? Bohannon.
A couple of federal marshals are coming to arrest me tonight.
For what? Murder.
So why ain't you just up and left? Sergeant's here.
Swede tracked him down.
I reckon he talked him into testifying against me.
How you know Harper will be the man you're looking for? - He has to be.
- You don't know that.
What the hell is your stake in all this? I ain't got none.
Why do you even care? You told me something once.
It was the only thing that ever set me free.
Yeah, what's that? You got to let go of the past.
You will be the king of the ball.
Unfortunately with no queen by my side.
:: Oh, you refer to Mrs Lily Bell? - Mmm.
Sir, shall we take a walk? Mr Gundersen, have you ever had your heart ripped out by a woman? I was married once, sir, but she ran off with a gypsy.
My heart was not ripped out, but she did steal my cuckoo clock.
Well, my gypsy is Bohannon.
Loki, yeah.
:: What? - So He And Mrs Lily Bell.
I gave him a chance to run, but he wouldn't take it.
Run? But why? Mr Gundersen, I told him about the federal marshals.
He knows you're up to something.
Oh! Why did you tell him? I wanted to get rid of him.
The fool wouldn't leave.
Why are you telling me this now? Because I want you to succeed in your plan, Mr Gundersen.
Mmm.
You need to get out of here.
:: now.
- Why? He's coming.
:: find a place to hide.
- Where? - I don't want to know.
- Why not? So Bohannon can't get it out of me.
Now, listen, no matter what, you must meet that train.
And when it arrive, the marshals will protect you.
Where is he? Where is who? In the myths of my homeland, there is a God who go by the name of Loki.
This Loki is the God of Chaos.
He cause nothing but trouble everywhere he go.
No matter how hard the other gods try to catch him, the slippery little devil always manages to escape.
You have three seconds to tell me where he is.
I honestly do not know.
If I did, I would not tell you.
Go ahead, kill me.
I go to my grave happy knowing that I'm the one who'll bring you down.
Just as I thought.
Killing me does not equate in your moral mathematics.
Eva! Hooee! Darling.
If you ain't slicker than a fine gentleman's snot rag.
You ain't looking too shabby your own self, gal.
Thank you.
Where'd you get that pretty thing? Mrs Bell gave it to me.
What you doing out here? They're building a town.
A real town.
I've been on the move for as long as I can remember.
Since before them injuns took me.
I was thinking it might be nice for us to, you know, settle down.
What you mean? Well, we're getting hitched, so why not settle down like a proper man and wife - And raise a family.
:: Getting hitched? like we talked about.
I ain't never said nothing about getting hitched.
But I I thought the other day you said that you wanted me to be yours.
I do.
Well, I thought that meant I just ain't thought things out that far.
And I sure as hell ain't staying in no podunk railroad town.
Look at me.
When they freed me, I ain't have a penny to my name, Eva.
And now I work for Mr Thomas Durant hisself.
Oh! I see.
For the first time in my life, I got money in my pocket.
My money in my pocket.
Might be looking at some kind of real future.
:: Without me? - No.
I want it with you.
What, as your private whore? You're here.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Imagine it.
A journey that now takes six months will be cut to seven days.
Seven days.
It boggles the mind.
You will be able to spend Christmas in New York and And New Year's in San Francisco.
Gentlemen, I give you Mrs Lily Bell.
- Ma'am.
:: Mrs Bell.
Is there room on your dance card? Evening, Miss Eva.
Mr Toole.
Are you not waiting for Mr Ferguson? No, I am not.
Ma'am, if I'm not overstepping me bounds, would you do me the honor of dancing with me? I'm sorry, Mr Toole.
I don't much feel like dancing right now.
I understand.
Thank you, ma'am.
Mr Toole.
There was a time out in the frontier with Robert when I wondered if this beautiful landscape might not be better unspoilt.
Part of me still wonders that.
But after seeing all these people working so hard to build this road, after understanding the sheer audacity of this American endeavor, well, I see now there truly is greatness in it.
To Lily Bell, the fair-haired maiden of the west.
:: Cheers.
:: Hear, hear.
You following me? Oh, no.
No, sir.
Just taking the evening air.
What is this? It's about a payment.
No, not now.
Hey! Hey! Get your bloody rope off me! Son of a bitch! Get your bloody hands off me! Your bloody hands off me! We're here to collect a debt, Mr Swede.
You be careful, Irish boy, what you choose to do now, son of a bitch.
Bloody How do you like that? Bust his head! Bastard! Get your hand off me, bloody Irish.
Bloody! Would you like to dance, sir? I'm sure some of these other fellows are much better dancers than me.
But I don't want these other fellows.
You'll see a lot of perks working for me, Mr Ferguson.
Is that right? Mmm-hmm.
Excuse me a second.
Ah Elam! What the hell are you doing with my woman? - Hey, now, Ferguson.
:: Stop it, Elam.
Let him go.
Come on, Elam.
I ain't your woman.
You made that pretty clear.
I didn't make nothing clear.
You're still mine.
What, like your property? I'm staying behind, Elam.
It seems like Mr Toole has got the same idea.
You and him? No, there ain't no me and him.
We're just two people who don't want to be vagabonds no more.
I love you, Elam, but I'm tired of being a tramp.
Excuse me.
Sorry, I'm afraid I need to cut in.
Damn it.
You don't have to do this.
I wasn't there, Mr Bohannon.
You're a liar.
Johnson said the sergeant strangled my wife.
And I saw the picture.
:: you was the platoon sergeant.
- Not then, I wasn't.
You raped and murdered my wife.
I wasn't there.
:: just admit it.
:: I can prove it.
No.
You have to be him.
I can prove it.
Hey.
I've been looking for you.
I seen the marshals back there.
Hmm.
You killed him? Yeah.
But he wasn't there.
I killed the wrong man.

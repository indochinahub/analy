0056	INTRODUCTION
0057	Scholars usually place the Angkorean period of Cambodian history be tween 802 and 1431. In fact, these years mark neither a beginning nor an end. The northwestern part of Cambodia, where the state we know as Angkor (the name derives from the Sanskrit word nagara, meaning “city”) sprang up in the ninth century, had been inhabited by Khmer speaking peoples for several hundred years. Moreover, although much of the city was abandoned in the fifteenth century, it remained an inhab ited site and was restored as a royal city briefly in the 1570s. More im portant, one of its major temples, Angkor Wat (i.e., the city-temple), was probably never abandoned by the Khmer, for it contains Buddhist statuary from every century between the fifteenth and the nineteenth and inscriptions on its walls from as late as 1747.1 When the Angkor complex was “discovered” by French missionaries and explorers in the 1850s, Angkor Wat contained a prosperous Buddhist monastery inside its walls, tended by several hundred hereditary slaves.
0058	These dates 802 and 1431 are useful all the same, for they mark off Cambodia’s period of greatness. At various times in these six hundred years, Cambodia—known in its own inscriptions as Kambuja-desa— was the mightiest kingdom in Southeast Asia, drawing visitors and trib ute from as far away as present-day Burma and Malaysia as well as from what were later to be Thai kingdoms to the west.
